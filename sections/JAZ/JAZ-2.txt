executive department or of such other body as Congress may by
law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tem-
pore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives their written declaration that the President is unable to
discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Con-
gress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours
for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress within twenty-
one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Con-
gress is not in session within twenty-one days after Congress is
required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses
that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties
of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the
same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall re-
sume the powers and duties of his office.
                           PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION
             The Twenty-fifth Amendment was an effort to resolve some of
        the continuing issues revolving about the office of the President; that
        is, what happens upon the death, removal, or resignation of the Presi-
        dent and what is the course to follow if for some reason the Presi-
        dent becomes disabled to such a degree that he cannot fulfill his
        responsibilities. The practice had been well established that the Vice
        President became President upon the death of the President, as had
        happened eight times in our history. Presumably, the Vice Presi-
        dent would become President upon the removal of the President from
        office. Whether the Vice President would become acting President
        when the President became unable to carry on and whether the Presi-
        dent could resume his office upon his recovering his ability were
        two questions that had divided scholars and experts. Also, seven
        Vice Presidents had died in office and one had resigned, so that for
        some twenty per cent of United States history there had been no
        Vice President to step up. But the seemingly most insoluble prob-
        lem was that of presidential inability—Garfield’s lying in a coma
        for eighty days before succumbing to the effects of an assassin’s bul-
        let, Wilson an invalid for the last eighteen months of his term, the
        result of a stroke—with its unanswered questions: who was to de-
        termine the existence of an inability, how was the matter to be handled
        if the President sought to continue, in what manner should the Vice
