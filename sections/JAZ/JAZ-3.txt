President act, would he be acting President or President, what was
to happen if the President recovered. Congress finally proposed this
Amendment to the states in the aftermath of President Kennedy’s
assassination, with the Vice Presidency vacant and a President who
had previously had a heart attack.
    The Amendment saw multiple use during the 1970s and re-
sulted for the first time in our history in the accession to the Presi-
dency and Vice-Presidency of two men who had not faced the vot-
ers in a national election. First, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned
on October 10, 1973, and President Nixon nominated Gerald R. Ford
to succeed him, following the procedures of § 2 of the Amendment
for the first time. Hearings were held upon the nomination by the
Senate Rules Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, both
Houses thereafter confirmed the nomination, and the new Vice Presi-
dent took the oath of office December 6, 1973. Second, President
Richard M. Nixon resigned his office August 9, 1974, and Vice Presi-
dent Ford immediately succeeded to the office and took the presi-
dential oath of office at noon of the same day. Third, again follow-
ing § 2 of the Amendment, President Ford nominated Nelson A.
Rockefeller to be Vice President; on August 20, 1974, hearings were
held in both Houses, confirmation voted, and Mr. Rockefeller took
the oath of office December 19, 1974.1
