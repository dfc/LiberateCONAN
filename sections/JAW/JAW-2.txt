     The Twenty-Second Amendment has yet to be tested or ap-
plied. Commentary suggests, however, that a number of issues could
be raised as to the Amendment’s meaning and application, espe-
cially in relation to the Twelfth Amendment. By its terms, the Twenty-
Second Amendment bars only the election of two-term Presidents,
and this prohibition would not prevent someone who had twice been
elected President from succeeding to the office after having been
elected or appointed Vice President. Broader language providing that
no such person “shall be chosen or serve as President . . . or be
eligible to hold the office” was rejected in favor of the Amendment’s
ban merely on election.2 Whether a two-term President could be elected
or appointed Vice President depends upon the meaning of the Twelfth
Amendment, which provides that “no person constitutionally ineli-
gible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-
President.” Is someone prohibited by the Twenty-Second Amend-
ment from being “elected” to the office of President thereby
“constitutionally ineligible to the office”? Note also that neither Amend-
ment addresses the eligibility of a former two-term President to serve
as Speaker of the House or as one of the other officers who could
serve as President through operation of the Succession Act.3

ciary Committee reported the measure, it would have made the covered category of
former presidents “ineligible to hold the office of President.” H.R. REP. NO. 17, 80th
