anomaly of imposing all the obligations of citizenship without the
most fundamental of its privileges will be removed by the proposed
constitutional amendment. . . .”
     “[This] . . . amendment would change the Constitution only to
the minimum extent necessary to give the District appropriate par-
ticipation in national elections. It would not make the District of
Columbia a State. It would not give the District of Columbia any
other attributes of a State or change the constitutional powers of
the Congress to legislate with respect to the District of Columbia
and to prescribe its form of government. . . . It would, however, per-
petuate recognition of the unique status of the District as the seat
of Federal Government under the exclusive legislative control of Con-
gress.” 1
