The course of decision over the period of almost one hundred years
was toward an expansion of the areas in which federal judges were
free to construct a federal common law and a concomitant contrac-
tion of the definition of “local” laws.1096 Although dissatisfaction with
Swift v. Tyson was almost always present, within and without the
Court,1097 it was the Court’s decision in Black & White Taxicab &
Transfer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co.1098 that brought




     1096 The expansions included Lane v. Vick, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 464 (1845) (wills);

City of Chicago v. Robbins, 67 U.S. (2 Bl.) 418 (1862), and Baltimore & Ohio R.R. v.
Baugh, 149 U.S. 368 (1893) (torts); Yates v. City of Milwaukee, 77 U.S. (10 Wall.)
497 (1870) (real estate titles and rights of riparian owners); Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal
Co., 215 U.S. 349 (1910) (mineral conveyances); Rowan v. Runnels, 46 U.S. (5 How.)
134 (1847) (contracts); Lake Shore & M.S. Ry. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101 (1893). It
was strongly contended that uniformity, the goal of Justice Story’s formulation, was
not being achieved, in great part because state courts followed their own rules of
decision even when prior federal decisions were contrary. Frankfurter, Distribution
of Judicial Power Between Federal and State Courts, 13 CORNELL L.Q. 499, 529 n.150
(1928). Moreover, the Court held that, although state court interpretations of state
statutes or constitutions were to be followed, federal courts could ignore them if they
conflicted with earlier federal constructions of the same statute or constitutional pro-
vision, Rowan v. Runnels, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 134 (1847), or if they had been rendered
after the case had been tried in federal court, Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U.S. 20 (1883),
thus promoting lack of uniformity. See also Gelpcke v. City of Debuque, 68 U.S. (1
Wall.) 175 (1865); Williamson v. Berry, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 495 (1850); Pease v. Peck,
59 U.S. (18 How.) 595 (1856); Watson v. Tarpley, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 517 (1856).
     1097 Extensions of the scope of Tyson frequently were rendered by a divided Court

over the strong protests of dissenters. E.g., Gelpcke v. City of Debuque, 68 U.S. (1
Wall.) 175 (1865); Lane v. Vick, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 463 (1845); Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal
Co., 215 U.S. 349 (1910). In Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368, 401–04
(1893), Justice Field dissented in an opinion in which he expressed the view that
Supreme Court disregarding of state court decisions was unconstitutional, a view
endorsed by Justice Holmes in Black & White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown &
Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U.S. 518, 533 (1928) (dissenting opinion), and
adopted by the Court in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938). Numer-
ous proposals were introduced in Congress to change the rule.
     1098 276 U.S. 518 (1928). B. & W. had contracted with a railroad to provide ex-

clusive taxi service at its station. B. & Y. began operating taxis at the same station
and B. & W. wanted to enjoin the operation, but it was a settled rule by judicial
decision in Kentucky courts that such exclusive contracts were contrary to public
policy and were unenforceable in court. Therefore, B. & W. dissolved itself in Ken-
tucky and reincorporated in Tennessee, solely in order to create diversity of citizen-
ship and enable itself to sue in federal court. It was successful and the Supreme
Court ruled that diversity was present and that the injunction should issue. In Mu-
tual Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 293 U.S. 335 (1934), the Court, in an opinion by Jus-
tice Cardozo, appeared to retreat somewhat from its extensions of Tyson, holding
that state law should be applied, through a “benign and prudent comity,” in a case
“balanced with doubt,” a concept first used by Justice Bradley in Burgess v. Selig-
man, 107 U.S. 20 (1883).
