tions about legislative denials of jurisdiction for judicial review of
constitutional issues and construing statutes so as not to deny ju-
risdiction.1212
    Ex parte McCardle 1213 marks the farthest advance of congres-
sional imposition of its will on the federal courts, and it is signifi-
cant because the curb related to the availability of the writ of ha-
beas corpus, which is marked out with special recognition by the
Constitution.1214
     But how far did McCardle actually reach? In concluding its opin-
ion, the Court carefully observed: “Counsel seem to have supposed,
if effect be given to the repealing act in question, that the whole
appellate power of the court, in cases of habeas corpus, is denied.
But this is an error. The act of 1868 does not exempt from that
jurisdiction any cases but appeals from Circuit Courts under the
act of 1867. It does not affect the jurisdiction which was previously
exercised.” 1215 A year later, in Ex parte Yerger,1216 the Court held
that it did have authority under the Judiciary Act of 1789 to re-
view on certiorari a denial by a circuit court of a petition for writ
of habeas corpus on behalf of one held by the military in the South.
It thus remains unclear whether the Court would have followed its
language suggesting plenary congressional control if the effect had
been to deny absolutely an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas
corpus.1217

sional discretion. Id. at 611–15 (concurring).

     1215 Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506, 515 (1869). A restrained reading

of McCardle is strongly suggested by Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651 (1996). A 1996
congressional statute giving to federal courts of appeal a “gate-keeping” function over
the filing of second or successive habeas petitions limited further review, including
denying the Supreme Court appellate review of circuit court denials of motions to
file second or successive habeas petitions. Pub. L. 104–132, § 106, 110 Stat. 1214,
1220, amending 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b). Upholding the limitation, which was nearly iden-
tical to the congressional action at issue in McCardle and Yerger, the Court held
that its jurisdiction to hear appellate cases had been denied, but, just as in Yerger,
the statute did not annul the Court’s jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions filed as
original matters in the Supreme Court. No constitutional issue was thus presented.
