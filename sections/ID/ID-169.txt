    (1) The principal difficulty here was that after Jensen the Su-
preme Court did not maintain the line between permissible and im-
permissible state-authorized recovery at the water’s edge, but cre-
ated a “maritime but local” exception, by which some injuries incurred
in or on navigable waters could be compensated under state work-
men’s compensation laws or state negligence laws.923 “The applica-
tion of the State Workmen’s Compensation Acts has been sustained
where the work of the employee has been deemed to have no direct
relation to navigation or commerce and the operation of the local
law ‘would work no material prejudice to the essential features of
the general maritime law.’ ” 924 Because Congress provided in the
Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act for recov-
ery under the Act “if recovery . . . may not validly be provided by
State law,” 925 it was held that the “maritime but local” exception
had been statutorily perpetuated,926 thus creating the danger for
injured workers or their survivors that they might choose to seek
relief by the wrong avenue to their prejudice. This danger was sub-
sequently removed by the Court when it recognized that there was
a “twilight zone,” a “shadowy area,” in which recovery under either
the federal law or a state law could be justified, and held that in
such a “twilight zone” the injured party should be enabled to re-
cover under either.927 Then, in Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co.,928 the
Court virtually read out of the Act its inapplicability when compen-
sation would be afforded by state law and held that Congress’s in-
tent in enacting the statute was to extend coverage to all workers
who sustain injuries while on navigable waters of the United States

lice powers respecting maritime activities concurrently with the Federal Govern-
ment, such as by providing for liability for oil spill damages, noted that Jensen and
its progeny, although still possessing vitality, have been confined to their facts; thus,
it is only with regard “to suits relating to the relationship of vessels, plying the high
seas and our navigable waters, and to their crews” that state law is proscribed. Id.

The exception continued to be applied following enactment of the Longshoremen’s
and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. See cases cited in Davis v. Department of

33 U.S.C. § 903(a), Congress ratified Calbeck by striking out “if recovery . . . may
not validly be provided by State law.”
