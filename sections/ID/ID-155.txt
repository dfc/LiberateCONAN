Court review, the nonfederal ground must be broad enough, with-
out reference to the federal question, to sustain the state court judg-
ment; 837 it must be independent of the federal question; 838 and it
must be tenable.839 Rejection of a litigant’s federal claim by the state
court on state procedural grounds, such as failure to tender the is-
sue at the appropriate time, will ordinarily preclude Supreme Court
review as an adequate independent state ground,840 so long as the
local procedure does not discriminate against the raising of federal
claims and has not been used to stifle a federal claim or to evade
vindication of federal rights.841
Suits Affecting Ambassadors, Other Public Ministers, and
  Consuls
    The earliest interpretation of the grant of original jurisdiction
to the Supreme Court came in the Judiciary Act of 1789, which con-
ferred on the federal district courts jurisdiction of suits to which a
consul might be a party. This legislative interpretation was sus-
tained in 1793 in a circuit court case in which the judges held the
Congress might vest concurrent jurisdiction involving consuls in the
inferior courts and sustained an indictment against a consul.842 Many
years later, the Supreme Court held that consuls could be sued in
federal court,843 and in another case in the same year declared sweep-
ingly that Congress could grant concurrent jurisdiction to the infe-
rior courts in cases where Supreme Court has been invested with
original jurisdiction.844 Nor does the grant of original jurisdiction
to the Supreme Court in cases affecting ambassadors and consuls
     837 Murdock v. City of Memphis, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 590, 636 (1874). A new state

rule cannot be invented for the occasion in order to defeat the federal claim. E.g.,
Ford v. Georgia, 498 U.S. 411, 420–425 (1991).
     838 Enterprise Irrigation Dist. v. Farmers’ Mutual Canal Co., 243 U.S. 157, 164

(1917); Ivanhoe Irrigation Dist. v. McCracken, 357 U.S. 275, 290 (1958).
     839 Enterprise Irrigation Dist. v. Farmers’ Mutual Canal Co., 243 U.S. 157, 164

(1917); Ward v. Love County, 253 U.S. 17, 22 (1920); Staub v. City of Baxley, 355
U.S. 313 (1958).
     840 Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. ___, No. 08–992, slip op. (2009) (firmly estab-

lished procedural rule adequate state ground even though rule is discretionary). Ac-
cord, Walker v. Martin, 562 ___, No. 09–996, slip op. (2010). See also Nickel v. Cole,
256 U.S. 222, 225 (1921); Wolfe v. North Carolina, 364 U.S. 177, 195 (1960). But see
Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22 (1923); Brown v. Western Ry. of Alabama, 338 U.S.
294 (1949).
     841 Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22, 24–25 (1923); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Pat-

terson, 357 U.S. 449, 455–458 (1958); Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146, 149
(1964). This rationale probably explains Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443 (1965).
See also in the criminal area, Edelman v. California, 344 U.S. 357, 362 (1953) (dis-
senting opinion); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 554 (1953) (dissenting opinion); Wil-
liams v. Georgia, 349 U.S. 375, 383 (1955); Monger v. Florida, 405 U.S. 958 (1972)
(dissenting opinion).
