tion over the years, inasmuch as congressional displeasure with ju-
dicial decisions has sometimes led to successful efforts to “curb” the
courts and more frequently to proposed but unsuccessful curbs.1169
Supreme Court holdings establish clearly the breadth of congressio-
nal power, and numerous dicta assert an even broader power, but
that Congress may through the exercise of its powers vitiate and
overturn constitutional decisions and restrain the exercise of consti-
tutional rights is an assertion often made but not sustained by any
decision of the Court.
     Appellate Jurisdiction.—In Wiscart v. D’Auchy,1170 the issue
was whether the statutory authorization for the Supreme Court to
review on writ of error circuit court decisions in “civil actions” gave
it power to review admiralty cases.1171 A majority of the Court de-
cided that admiralty cases were “civil actions” and thus review-
able; in the course of decision, it was said that “[i]f Congress had
provided no rule to regulate our proceedings, we cannot exercise
an appellate jurisdiction; and if the rule is provided, we cannot de-
part from it.” 1172 Much the same thought was soon to be expressed
by Chief Justice Marshall, although he seems to have felt that in
the absence of congressional authorization, the Court’s appellate ju-
risdiction would have been measured by the constitutional grant.
“Had the judicial act created the supreme court, without defining
or limiting its jurisdiction, it must have been considered as possess-

islature would have exercised the power it possessed of creating a
supreme court, as ordained by the constitution; and in omitting to
exercise the right of excepting from its constitutional powers, would
have necessarily left those powers undiminished.”
    “The appellate powers of this court are not given by the judi-

and regulated by the judicial act, and by such other acts as have

that admiralty cases were not “civil actions” and thus that there was no appellate
review. Id. at 326–27. See also Clarke v. Bazadone, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 212 (1803); Turner
