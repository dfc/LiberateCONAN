she may presumably apply for mandamus to compel compli-
ance.1247 Statutorily, the Court may attempt to overcome state re-
calcitrance by a variety of specific forms of judgment.1248 If, how-

U.S. 386 (1909); 215 U.S. 580 (1909), on action by the Attorney General, the Court
appointed a commissioner to take testimony, rendered judgment of conviction, and
imposed sentence on a state sheriff who had conspired with others to cause the lynch-
ing of a prisoner in his custody after the Court had allowed an appeal from a circuit
court’s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A question whether a probate
judge was guilty of contempt of an order of the Court in failing to place certain
candidates on the ballot was certified to the district court, over the objections of
Justices Douglas and Harlan, who wished to follow the Shipp practice. In re Herndon,
