them civil rights and civil liberties cases.1281 Time-consuming de-
lays 1282 and piecemeal resolution of important questions 1283 were
cited as a too-costly consequence of the doctrine. Actions brought
under the civil rights statutes seem not to have been wholly sub-
ject to the doctrine,1284 and for awhile cases involving First Amend-
ment expression guarantees seemed to be sheltered as well, but this
is no longer the rule.1285 Abstention developed robustly with Younger
v. Harris,1286 and its progeny.
     Exhaustion of State Remedies.—A complainant will ordinar-
ily be required, as a matter of comity, to exhaust all available state
legislative and administrative remedies before seeking relief in fed-
eral court.1287 To do so may make unnecessary federal-court adjudi-
cation. The complainant will ordinarily not be required, however,
to exhaust his state judicial remedies, inasmuch as it is a litigant’s
choice to proceed in either state or federal courts when the alterna-
tives exist and a question for judicial adjudication is present.1288




     1281 McNeese v. Cahokia Bd. of Educ., 373 U.S. 668 (1963); Griffin v. School Board,

377 U.S. 218 (1964); Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U.S. 324
(1964); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964); Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678 (1964);
Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965); Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528
(1965); Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241 (1967); Wisconsin v. Constanineau, 400 U.S.
433 (1971).
     1282 England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 426 (1964)

(Justice Douglas concurring). See C. WRIGHT, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS
305 (4th ed. 1983).
     1283 Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 378–379 (1964). Both consequences may be

alleviated substantially by state adoption of procedures by which federal courts may
certify to the state’s highest court questions of unsettled state law which would be
dispositive of the federal court action. The Supreme Court has actively encouraged
resort to certification where it exists. Clay v. Sun Insurance Office Ltd., 363 U.S.
207 (1960); Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386 (1974); Bellotti v. Baird, 428
U.S. 132, 151 (1976).
     1284 Compare Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167 (1959), with McNeese v. Cahokia

Bd. of Educ., 373 U.S. 668 (1963).
     1285 Compare Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964), and Dombrowski v. Pfister,

380 U.S. 479 (1965), with Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and Samuels v.
Mackell, 401 U.S. 66 (1971). See Babbitt v. United Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289,
305–312 (1979).
     1286 401 U.S. 37 (1971). There is room to argue whether the Younger line of cases

represents the abstention doctrine at all, but the Court continues to refer to it in
those terms. E.g., Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 705 (1992).
     1287 The rule was formulated in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210

(1908), and Bacon v. Rutland R.R., 232 U.S. 134 (1914).
     1288 City Bank Farmers’ Trust Co. v. Schnader, 291 U.S. 24 (1934); Lane v. Wil-

son, 307 U.S. 268 (1939). But see Alabama Public Service Comm’n v. Southern Ry.,
341 U.S. 341 (1951). Exhaustion of state court remedies is required in habeas cor-
pus cases and usually in suits to restrain state court proceedings.
