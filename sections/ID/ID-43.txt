the proceeding, he must afford the alleged contemnor at least rea-
sonable notice of the specific charge and opportunity to be heard in
his own defense. Apparently, a “full scale trial” is not contem-
plated.216
    Curbing the judge’s power to consider conduct as occurring in
his presence, the Court, in Harris v. United States,217 held that sum-
mary contempt proceedings in aid of a grand jury probe, achieved
through swearing the witness and repeating the grand jury’s ques-
tions in the presence of the judge, did not constitute contempt “in
the actual presence of the court” for purposes of Rule 42(a); rather,
the absence of a disturbance in the court’s proceedings or of the
need to immediately vindicate the court’s authority makes the wit-
ness’ refusal to testify an offense punishable only after notice and a
hearing.218 Moreover, when it is not clear that the judge was fully
aware of the contemptuous behavior when it occurred, notwithstand-
ing the fact that it occurred during the trial, “a fair hearing would
entail the opportunity to show that the version of the event related
to the judge was inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.” 219
    Due Process Limitations on Contempt Power: Right to Jury
Trial.—Originally, the right to a jury trial was not available in crimi-
nal contempt cases.220 But the Court held in Cheff v. Schnackenberg,221
that a defendant is entitled to trial by jury when the punishment
in a criminal contempt case in federal court is more than the sen-
tence for a petty offense, traditionally six months. Although the rul-
ing was made pursuant to the Supreme Court’s supervisory powers
and was thus inapplicable to state courts and presumably subject
to legislative revision, two years later the Court held that the Con-
stitution also requires jury trials in criminal contempt cases in which

     216 Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488 (1974). In a companion case, the Court ob-

served that, although its rule conceivably encourages a trial judge to proceed imme-
diately rather than awaiting a calmer moment, “[s]ummary convictions during tri-
als that are unwarranted by the facts will not be invulnerable to appellate review.”

those cases prepared the ground for the Court’s later reversal. On the issue, see Frank-
