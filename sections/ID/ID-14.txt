protected by Article III’s guarantees by giving jurisdiction to unpro-
tected entities that, being subjected to influence, would be bent to
the popular will?
    Attempts to explain or to rationalize the predicament or to pro-
vide a principled limiting point have resulted from Canter to the
present in “frequently arcane distinctions and confusing prec-
edents” spelled out in cases comprising “landmarks on a judicial ‘dark-
ling plain’ where ignorant armies have clashed by night, as Justice
White apparently believes them to be.” 56 Nonetheless, Article I courts
are quite common entities in our judicial system.57
    Power of Congress Over Legislative Courts.—In creating leg-
islative courts, Congress is not limited by the restrictions imposed
in Article III concerning tenure during good behavior and the pro-
hibition against diminution of salaries. Congress may limit tenure
to a term of years, as it has done in acts creating territorial courts
and the Tax Court; it may subject the judges of legislative courts
to removal by the President; 58 and it may reduce their salaries dur-
ing their terms.59 Similarly, it follows that Congress can vest in leg-
islative courts nonjudicial functions of a legislative or advisory na-
ture and deprive their judgments of finality. Thus, in Gordon v. United
States,60 there was no objection to the power of the Secretary of
the Treasury and Congress to revise or suspend the early judg-
ments of the Court of Claims. Likewise, in United States v. Fer-
reira,61 the Court sustained the act conferring powers on the Florida
territorial court to examine claims rising under the Spanish treaty
and to report its decisions and the evidence on which they were
based to the Secretary of the Treasury for subsequent action. “A
power of this description,” the Court said, “may constitutionally be

     57 In addition to the local courts of the District of Columbia, the bankruptcy

courts, and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, considered infra, these include the
United States Tax Court, formerly an independent agency in the Treasury Depart-
ment, but by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, § 951, 83 Stat. 730, 26 U.S.C. § 7441,
made an Article I court of record, the Court of Veterans Appeals, Act of Nov. 18,
1988, 102 Stat. 4105, 38 U.S.C. § 4051, and the courts of the territories of the United
States. Magistrate judges are adjuncts of the District Courts, see infra, and perform
a large number of functions, usually requiring the consent of the litigants. See Gomez
v. United States, 490 U.S. 858 (1989); Peretz v. United States, 501 U.S. 923 (1991).
The U.S. Court of Military Appeals, strictly speaking, is not part of the judiciary
but is a military tribunal, 10 U.S.C. § 867, although Congress designated it an Ar-
ticle I tribunal and has given the Supreme Court certiorari jurisdiction over its de-
cisions.
