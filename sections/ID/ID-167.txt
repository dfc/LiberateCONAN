cases in which the actions were noticeable.911 In Southern Pacific
Co. v. Jensen,912 a sharply divided Court held that New York could
not constitutionally apply its workmen’s compensation system to em-
ployees injured or killed on navigable waters. For the Court, Jus-
tice McReynolds reasoned “that the general maritime law, as ac-
cepted by the federal courts, constituted part of our national law,
applicable to matters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdic-
tion.” 913 Recognizing that “it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to define with exactness just how far the general maritime law may
be changed, modified or affected by state legislation,” still it was
certain that “no such legislation is valid if it works material preju-
dice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, or
interferes with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its
international and interstate relations.” 914 The “savings to suitors”
clause was unavailing because the workmen’s compensation stat-
ute created a remedy “of a character wholly unknown to the com-
mon law, incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any
court and is not saved to suitors from the grant of exclusive juris-
diction.” 915
    Congress required three opportunities to legislate to meet the
problem created by the decision, the lack of remedy for maritime
workers to recover for injuries resulting from the negligence of their
employers. First, Congress enacted a statute saving to claimants
their rights and remedies under state workmen’s compensation laws.916
The Court invalidated it as an unconstitutional delegation of legis-
lative power to the states. “The Constitution itself adopted and es-
tablished, as part of the laws of the United States, approved rules

557 (1834); The Belfast, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 624 (1869); American Steamboat Co. v.
Chase, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 522 (1872); Quebec Steamship Co. v. Merchant, 133 U.S.

Compagnie Gen. Transatlantique, 182 U.S. 406 (1901).
     912 244 U.S. 205 (1917). The worker here had been killed, but the same result

was reached in a case of nonfatal injury. Clyde S.S. Co. v. Walker, 244 U.S. 255
(1917). In Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., 247 U.S. 372 (1918), the Jensen holding
was applied to preclude recovery in a negligence action against the injured party’s
employer under state law. Under The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158 (1903), the employee
had a maritime right to wages, maintenance, and cure.

     914 244 U.S. at 216.
     915 244 U.S. at 218. There were four dissenters: Justices Holmes, Pitney, Brandeis,

and Clarke. The Jensen dissent featured such Holmesian epigrams as: “[J]udges do
and must legislate, but they can do so only interstitially; they are confined from
molar to molecular motions,” id. at 221, and the famous statement supporting the
assertion that supplementation of maritime law had to come from state law because
“[t]he common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky but the articulate voice
of some sovereign or quasi-sovereign that can be identified. . . . It always is the law
of some State. . . .” Id. at 222.
