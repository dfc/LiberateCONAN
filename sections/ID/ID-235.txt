vidual predilections in sensitive and emotional areas.1308 Because,
however, of the heavy burden that convening a three-judge court
placed on the judiciary and that the direct appeals placed on the
Supreme Court, the provisions for such courts, save in cases “when
otherwise required by an Act of Congress” 1309 or in cases involving
state legislative or congressional districting, were repealed by Con-
gress in 1976.1310

Conflicts of Jurisdiction: Federal Court Interference with
 State Courts
    One challenging the constitutionality, under the United States
Constitution, of state actions, statutory or otherwise, could, of course,
bring suit in state court; indeed, in the time before conferral of federal-
question jurisdiction on lower federal courts plaintiffs had to bring
actions in state courts, and on some occasions since, this has been
done.1311 But the usual course is to sue in federal court for either
an injunction or a declaratory judgment or both. In an era in which
landmark decisions of the Supreme Court and of inferior federal
courts have been handed down voiding racial segregation require-
ments, legislative apportionment and congressional districting, abor-
tion regulations, and many other state laws and policies, it is diffi-
cult to imagine a situation in which it might be impossible to obtain
such rulings because no one required as a defendant could be sued.
Yet, the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment in 1798 resulted in
the immunity of the state,1312 and the immunity of state officers if
the action upon which they were being sued was state action,1313

U.S. 565, 567 (1928).
     1309 These now are primarily limited to suits under the Voting Rights Act, 42

U.S.C. §§ 1973b(a), 1973c, 1973h(c), and to certain suits by the Attorney General
under public accommodations and equal employment provisions of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a–5(b), 2000e–6(b).
     1310 Pub. L. 94–381, 90 Stat. 1119, 28 U.S.C. § 2284. In actions still required to

be heard by three-judge courts, direct appeals are still available to the Supreme Court.

     1311 For example, one of the cases decided in Brown v. Board of Education, 347

U.S. 483 (1954), came from the Supreme Court of Delaware. In Scott v. Germano,
381 U.S. 407 (1965), the Court set aside an order of the district court refusing to
defer to the state court which was hearing an apportionment suit and said: “The
power of the judiciary of a State to require valid reapportionment or to formulate a
valid redistricting plan has not only been recognized by this Court but appropriate
action by the States has been specifically encouraged.” See also Scranton v. Drew,
379 U.S. 40 (1964).
     1312 By its terms, the Eleventh Amendment bars only suits against a state by

citizens of other states, but, in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), the Court deemed
it to embody principles of sovereign immunity that applied to unconsented suits by
its own citizens.
