that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have
invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitu-
tion to the several States.” 1107
    Third, the rule of Erie replacing Tyson is that “[e]xcept in mat-
ters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress,
the law to be applied in any case is the law of the State. Whether
the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a stat-
ute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal
concern.” 1108
    Since 1938, the effect of Erie has first increased and then dimin-
ished, as the nature of the problems presented changed. Thus, the
Court at first indicated that not only were the decisions of the high-
est court of a state binding on a federal diversity court, but also
decisions of intermediate appellate courts 1109 and courts of first in-
stance,1110 even where the decisions bound no other state judge ex-
cept as they were persuasive on their merits. It has now retreated
from this position, concluding that federal judges are to give care-
ful consideration to lower state court decisions and to old, perhaps
outmoded decisions, but that they must find for themselves the state
law if the state’s highest court has not spoken definitively within a
period that would raise no questions about the continued viability
of the decision.1111 In the event of a state supreme court reversal of
an earlier decision, the federal courts are, of course, bound by the
later decision, and a judgment of a federal district court, correct
when rendered, must be reversed on appeal if the state’s highest
court in the meantime has changed the applicable law.1112 In diver-
sity cases that present conflicts of law problems, the Court has re-
iterated that the district court is to apply the law of the state in
which it sits, so that in a case in State A in which the law of State
