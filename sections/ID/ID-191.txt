given “diversity jurisdiction” in one form or another to the federal
courts since the Judiciary Act of 1789.1056 The traditional explana-
tion remains that offered by Chief Justice Marshall. “However true
the fact may be, that the tribunals of the states will administer jus-
tice as impartially as those of the nation, to parties of every descrip-
tion, it is not less true that the Constitution itself either entertains
apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence the
possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has established
national tribunals for the decision of controversies between aliens
and a citizen, or between citizens of different states.” 1057 Other ex-
planations have been offered and controverted,1058 but diversity cases
constitute a large bulk of cases on the dockets of the federal courts
today, though serious proposals for restricting access to federal courts
in such cases have been before Congress for some time.1059 The es-
sential difficulty with this type of jurisdiction is that it requires fed-
eral judges to decide issues of local import on the basis of their read-
ing of how state judges would decide them, an oftentimes laborious
process, which detracts from the time and labor needed to resolve
issues of federal import.
    The Meaning of “State” and the District of Columbia Prob-
lem.—In Hepburn v. Ellzey,1060 Chief Justice Marshall for the Court
confined the meaning of the word “state” as used in the Constitu-
tion to “the members of the American confederacy” and ruled that
a citizen of the District of Columbia could not sue a citizen of Vir-
ginia on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Marshall noted that it
     1056 1 Stat. 78, 11. The statute also created alienage jurisdiction of suits be-

tween a citizen of a state and an alien. See Holt, The Origins of Alienage Jurisdic-
tion, 14 OKLA. CITY L. REV. 547 (1989). Early versions of the statute conferred diver-
sity jurisdiction only when the suit was between a citizen of the state in which the
suit was brought and a citizen of another state. The Act of March 3, 1875, § 1. 18
Stat. 470, first established the language in the present statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1),
merely requiring diverse citizenship, so that a citizen of Maryland could sue a citi-
zen of Delaware in federal court in New Jersey. The statute also sets a threshold
amount at controversy for jurisdiction to attach; the jurisdictional amount was as
low as $3,000 in 1958, but set at $75,000 in 1996. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Snyder v.
Harris, 394 U.S. 332 (1969), held that in a class action in diversity the individual
claims could not be aggregated to meet the jurisdictional amount. Zahn v. Interna-
tional Paper Co., 414 U.S. 291 (1974), extended Snyder in holding that even though
the named plaintiffs had claims of more than $10,000, the extant jurisdictional amount,
they could not represent a class in which many of the members had claims for less
than $10,000. A separate provision on diversity and class actions sets the jurisdic-
tional amount at $5 million. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).
