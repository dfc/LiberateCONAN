judgments, orders, and writs of the courts, and consequently to the
due administration of justice. The moment the courts of the United
States were called into existence and invested with jurisdiction over
any subject, they became possessed of this power.” Expressing doubts
concerning the validity of the act as to the Supreme Court, he de-
clared, however, that there could be no question of its validity as
applied to the lower courts on the ground that they are created by
Congress and that their “powers and duties depend upon the act
calling them into existence, or subsequent acts extending or limit-
ing their jurisdiction.” 195 With the passage of time, later adjudica-
tions, especially after 1890, came to place more emphasis on the
inherent power of courts to punish contempts than upon the power
of Congress to regulate summary attachment.
     By 1911, the Court was saying that the contempt power must
be exercised by a court without referring the issues of fact or law
to another tribunal or to a jury in the same tribunal.196 In Michaelson
v. United States,197 the Court intentionally placed a narrow inter-
pretation upon those sections of the Clayton Act 198 relating to pun-
ishment for contempt of court by disobedience of injunctions in la-
bor disputes. The sections in question provided for a jury upon the
demand of the accused in contempt cases in which the acts commit-
ted in violation of district court orders also constituted a crime un-
der the laws of the United States or of those of the state where
they were committed. Although Justice Sutherland reaffirmed ear-
lier rulings establishing the authority of Congress to regulate the
contempt power, he went on to qualify this authority and declared
that “the attributes which inhere in the power [to punish con-
tempt] and are inseparable from it can neither be abrogated nor
rendered practically inoperative.” The Court mentioned specifically
“the power to deal summarily with contempt committed in the pres-
ence of the courts or so near thereto as to obstruct the administra-
tion of justice,” and the power to enforce mandatory decrees by co-
ercive means.199 This latter power, to enforce, the Court has held,
includes the authority to appoint private counsel to prosecute a crimi-
nal contempt.200 Although the contempt power may be inherent, it
