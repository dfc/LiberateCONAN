     The suit was begun in 1906, and a judgment was rendered against
West Virginia in 1915. Finally, in 1917, Virginia filed a suit against
West Virginia to show cause why, in default of payment of the judg-
ment, an order should not be entered directing the West Virginia
legislature to levy a tax for payment of the judgment.1021 Starting
with the rule that the judicial power essentially involves the right
to enforce the results of its exertion,1022 the Court proceeded to hold
that it applied with the same force to states as to other liti-
gants 1023 and to consider appropriate remedies for the enforcement
of its authority. In this connection, Chief Justice White declared:
“As the powers to render the judgment and to enforce it arise from
the grant in the Constitution on that subject, looked at from a ge-
neric point of view, both are federal powers and, comprehensively
considered, are sustained by every authority of the Federal Govern-
ment, judicial, legislative, or executive, which may be appropri-
ately exercised.” 1024 The Court, however, left open the question of
its power to enforce the judgment under existing legislation and sched-
uled the case for reargument at the next term. Before that could
occur, West Virginia accepted the Court’s judgment and entered into
an agreement with Virginia to pay it.1025

Controversies Between a State and Citizens of Another
 State
    The decision in Chisholm v. Georgia 1026 that cases “between a
state and citizens of another state” included those where a state
was a party defendant provoked the proposal and ratification of the
Eleventh Amendment, and since then controversies between a state
and citizens of another state have included only those cases where
the state has been a party plaintiff or has consented to be sued.1027
As a party plaintiff, a state may bring actions against citizens of
other states to protect its legal rights or in some instances as parens
patriae to protect the health and welfare of its citizens. In general,
the Court has tended to construe strictly this grant of judicial power,
which simultaneously comes within its original jurisdiction, by per-
haps an even more rigorous application of the concepts of cases and
