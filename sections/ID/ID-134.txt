structions, interpretivism and noninterpretivism.714 Using a struc-
tural argument, one seeks to infer structural rules from the rela-
tionships that the Constitution mandates.715 The remaining three
modes are not necessarily tied to original intent, text, or structure,
though they may have some relationship. Doctrinal arguments pro-
ceed from the application of precedents. Prudential arguments seek
to balance the costs and benefits of a particular rule. Ethical argu-
ments derive rules from those moral commitments of the American
ethos that are reflected in the Constitution.
     Although the scholarly writing ranges widely, a much more nar-
row scope is seen in the actual political-judicial debate. Rare is the
judge who will proclaim a devotion to ethical guidelines, such, for
example, as natural-law precepts. The usual debate ranges from those
adherents of strict construction and original intent to those with
loose construction and adaptation of text to modern-day condi-
tions.716 However, it is with regard to more general rules of pru-
dence and self-restraint that one usually finds the enunciation and
application of limitations on the exercise of constitutional judicial
review.
     Prudential Considerations.—Implicit in the argument of
Marbury v. Madison 717 is the thought that the Court is obligated
to take and decide cases meeting jurisdictional standards. Chief Jus-
tice Marshall spelled this out in Cohens v. Virginia: 718 “It is most
true that this Court will not take jurisdiction if it should not: but
it is equally true, that it must take jurisdiction if it should. The
judiciary cannot, as the legislature may, avoid a measure because
it approaches the confines of the constitution. We cannot pass it by
because it is doubtful. With whatever doubts, with whatever diffi-
culties, a case may be attended, we must decide it, if it be brought
