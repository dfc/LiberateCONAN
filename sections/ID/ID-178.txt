eral law is in issue, the fact that defendants claim the property as
officers or agents of the United States does not make the action one
against the United States until it is determined that they were act-
ing within the scope of their lawful authority.978 On the other hand,
the rule that a suit in which the judgment would affect the United
States or its property is a suit against the United States has also
been repeatedly approved and reaffirmed.979 But, as the Court has
pointed out, it is not “an easy matter to reconcile all of the deci-
sions of the court in this class of cases,” 980 and, as Justice Frank-
furter quite justifiably stated in a dissent, “the subject is not free
from casuistry.” 981 Justice Douglas’ characterization of Land v. Dol-
lar, “this is the type of case where the question of jurisdiction is
dependent on decision of the merits,” 982 is frequently applicable.
     Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp.,983 illuminates these obscu-
rities somewhat. A private company sought to enjoin the Adminis-
trator of the War Assets in his official capacity from selling surplus
coal to others than the plaintiff who had originally bought the coal,
only to have the sale cancelled by the Administrator because of the
company’s failure to make an advance payment. Chief Justice Vinson
and a majority of the Court looked upon the suit as one brought
against the Administrator in his official capacity, acting under a valid
statute and therefore a suit against the United States. It held that,
although an officer in such a situation is not immune from suits for
his own torts, his official action, though tortious, cannot be en-
joined or diverted, because it is also the action of the sovereign.984
The Court then proceeded to repeat the rule that “the action of an
officer of the sovereign (be it holding, taking, or otherwise legally
affecting the plaintiff ’s property) can be regarded as so individual
only if it is not within the officer’s statutory powers, or, if within
those powers, only if the powers or their exercise in the particular
