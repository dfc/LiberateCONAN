as an absolute, in recognition of the fact that a federal court injunc-
tion could properly issue in exceptional and limited circumstances,
such as the existence of factors making it impossible for a litigant
to protect his federal constitutional rights through a defense of the
state criminal charges or the bringing of multiple criminal charges.1320
    In Dombrowski v. Pfister,1321 the Court appeared to change the
policy somewhat. The case on its face contained allegations and of-
fers of proof that may have been sufficient alone to establish the
“irreparable injury” justifying federal injunctive relief.1322 But the
formulation of standards by Justice Brennan for the majority placed
great emphasis upon the fact that the state criminal statute in is-
sue regulated expression. Any criminal prosecution under a statute
regulating expression might of itself inhibit the exercise of First
Amendment rights, he said, and prosecution under an overbroad
statute,1323 such as the one in this case, might critically impair ex-
ercise of those rights. The mere threat of prosecution under such
an overbroad statute “may deter . . . almost as potently as the ac-
tual application of sanctions. . . .” 1324
    In such cases, courts could no longer embrace “[t]he assump-
tion that defense of a criminal prosecution will generally assure ample
vindication of constitutional rights,” because either the mere threat
of prosecution or the long wait between prosecution and final vindi-
cation could result in a “chilling effect upon the exercise of First

las v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157 (1943). There is a stricter rule against federal
restraint of the use of evidence in state criminal trials. Stefanelli v. Minard, 342
U.S. 117 (1951); Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U.S. 458 (1961). The Court reaffirmed the
rule in Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82 (1971). State officers may not be enjoined
from testifying or using evidence gathered in violation of federal constitutional re-
strictions, Cleary v. Bolger, 371 U.S. 392 (1963), but the rule is unclear with regard
to federal officers and state trials. Compare Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214 (1956),
with Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U.S. 381 (1961).
     1320 E.g., Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 163–164 (1943); Stefanelli

v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 122 (1951). See also Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197,
214 (1923), Future criminal proceedings were sometimes enjoined. E.g., Hague v.
CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939).
     1321 380 U.S. 479 (1965). Grand jury indictments had been returned after the

district court had dissolved a preliminary injunction, erroneously in the Supreme
Court’s view, so that it took the view that no state proceedings were pending as of
the appropriate time. For a detailed analysis of the case, see Fiss, Dombrowski, 86
YALE L. J. 1103 (1977).
     1322 “[T]he allegations in this complaint depict a situation in which defense of

the State’s criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitu-
tional rights. They suggest that a substantial loss of or impairment of freedoms of
expression will occur if appellants must await the state court’s disposition and ulti-
mate review in this Court of any adverse determination. These allegations, if true,
clearly show irreparable injury.” 380 U.S. at 485–86.
     1323 That is, a statute that reaches both protected and unprotected expression

and conduct.
