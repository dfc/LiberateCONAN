tify before a grand jury. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that
the defendants were in civil contempt, notwithstanding their sen-
tence for a definite period of time, on the grounds that the test for
determining whether the contempt is civil or criminal is what the
court primarily seeks to accomplish by imposing sentence.183 Here,
the purpose was to obtain answers to the questions for the grand
jury, and the court provided for the defendants’ release upon com-
pliance; whereas, “a criminal contempt proceeding would be charac-
terized by the imposition of an unconditional sentence for punish-
ment or deterence.” 184
    In International Union, UMW v. Bagwell,185 however, the Court
formulated a new test for drawing the distinction between civil and
criminal contempt in certain cases. Henceforth, the imposition of
non-compensatory contempt fines for the violation of any complex
injunction will require criminal proceedings. This case, as have so
many, involved the imposition of large fines (here, $52 million) upon
a union in a strike situation for violations of an elaborate court in-
junction restraining union activity during the strike. The Court was
vague with regard to the standards for determining when a court
order is “complex” and thus requires the protection of criminal pro-
ceedings.186
    The Court has also recognized a second, but more subtle distinc-
tion between types of contempt, and that is the difference between
direct and indirect contempt. Direct contempt results when the con-
tumacious act is committed “in the presence of the Court or so near
thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice,” 187 while indi-
rect contempt is behavior that the Court did not itself witness.188
The nature of the contumacious act, i.e., whether it is direct or in-
direct, is important because it determines the appropriate proce-
dure for charging the contemnor. As will be seen in the following
discussion, the history of the contempt powers of the American ju-
diciary is marked by two trends: a shrinking of the court’s power

    186 512 U.S. at 832–38. Relevant is the fact that the alleged contempts did not

occur in the presence of the court and that determinations of violations require elabo-
rate and reliable fact-finding. See esp. id. at 837–38.

provides, “A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies
that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was commit-
ted in the actual presence of the court.” See also Beale, Contempt of Court, Civil
