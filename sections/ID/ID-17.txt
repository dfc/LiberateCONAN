fined.” 76 This scheme was permissible, the Court said, because in
cases arising out of congressional statutes, an administrative tribu-
nal could make findings of fact and render an initial decision on
legal and constitutional questions, as long as there is adequate re-
view in a constitutional court.77 The “essential attributes” of deci-
sions must remain in an Article III court, but so long as it does,
Congress may use administrative decisionmakers in those private
rights cases that arise in the context of a comprehensive federal
statutory scheme.78 In Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon
Pipe Line Co., discussed infra, the Court reasserted that the distinc-
tion between “public rights” and “private rights” was still impor-
tant in determining which matters could be assigned to legislative
courts and administrative agencies and those that could not be, but
there was much the Court plurality did not explain.79
    The Court continued to waver with respect to the importance
of the public rights/private rights distinction. In two cases follow-
ing Marathon, it rejected the distinction as “a bright line test,” and
instead focused on “substance”—i.e., on the extent to which the par-
ticular grant of jurisdiction to an Article I court threatened judicial
integrity and separation of powers principles.80 Nonetheless, the Court
indicated that the distinction may be an appropriate starting point
for analysis. Thus, the fact that private rights traditionally at the
core of Article III jurisdiction are at stake leads the Court to a “search-



     76 285 U.S. at 51. On the constitutional problems of assignment to an adminis-

trative agency, see Atlas Roofing Co. v. OSHRC, 430 U.S. 442 (1977); NLRB v. Jones
& Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48 (1937).
     77 301 U.S. at 51–65.
     78 301 U.S. at 50, 51, 58–63. Thus, Article III concerns were satisfied by a re-

view of the agency fact finding upon the administrative record. Id. at 63–65. The
plurality opinion denied the validity of this approach in Northern Pipeline Constr.
Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 86 n.39 (1982), although Justice White
in dissent accepted it. Id. at 115. The plurality, rather, rationalized Crowell and sub-
sequent cases on an analysis seeking to ascertain whether agencies or Article I tri-
bunals were “adjuncts” of Article III courts, that is, whether Article III courts were
sufficiently in charge to protect constitutional values. Id. at 76–87.
     79 458 U.S. 50, 67–70 (1982) (plurality opinion). Thus, Justice Brennan ob-

serves that “a matter of public rights must at a minimum arise ‘between the govern-
ment and others,’ ” but “that the presence of the United States as a proper party to
the proceeding is a necessary but not sufficient means of distinguishing ‘private rights’
from ‘public rights.’ ” Id. at 69 & n.23. Crowell v. Benson, however, remained an em-
barrassing presence.
     80 Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Products Co., 473 U.S. 568 (1985); CFTC v.

Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986). The cases also abandoned the principle that the Federal
Government must be a party for the case to fall into the “public rights” category.
Thomas, 473 U.S. at 586; see also id. at 596–99 (Justice Brennan concurring).
