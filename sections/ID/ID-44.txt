the offense was more than a petty one.222 Whether an offense is
petty or not is determined by the maximum sentence authorized by
the legislature or, in the absence of a statute, by the sentence actu-
ally imposed. Again the Court drew the line between petty offenses
and more serious ones at six months’ imprisonment. Although this
case involved an indirect criminal contempt (willful petitioning to
admit to probate a will known to be falsely prepared) the majority
in dictum indicated that even in cases of direct contempt a jury will
be required in appropriate instances. “When a serious contempt is
at issue, considerations of efficiency must give way to the more fun-
damental interest of ensuring the even-handed exercise of judicial
power.” 223 Presumably, there is no equivalent right to a jury trial
in civil contempt cases,224 although one could spend much more time
in jail pursuant to a judgment of civil contempt than one could for
most criminal contempts.225 The Court has, however, expanded the
right to jury trials in federal civil cases on nonconstitutional grounds.226
     Due Process Limitations on Contempt Powers: Impartial
Tribunal.—In Cooke v. United States,227 Chief Justice Taft uttered
some cautionary words to guide trial judges in the use of their con-
tempt powers. “The power of contempt which a judge must have
and exercise in protecting the due and orderly administration of jus-
tice and in maintaining the authority and dignity of the court is
most important and indispensable. But its exercise is a delicate one
and care is needed to avoid arbitrary or oppressive conclusions. This
rule of caution is more mandatory where the contempt charged has
in it the element of personal criticism or attack upon the judge. The
judge must banish the slightest personal impulse to reprisal, but

Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821 (1994) (refining the test for when contempt citations are crimi-
nal and thus require jury trials).
     223 391 U.S. at 209. In Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506 (1974), the Court

held a jury trial to be required when the trial judge awaits the conclusion of the
proceeding and then imposes separate contempt sentences in which the total aggre-
gated more than six months even though no sentence for more than six months was
imposed for any single act of contempt. For a tentative essay at defining a petty
offense when a fine is levied, see Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U.S. 454, 475–77 (1975). In
International Union, UMW v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 837 n.5 (1994), the Court con-
tinued to reserve the question of the distinction between petty and serious con-
tempt fines, because of the size of the fine in that case.
     224 The Sixth Amendment is applicable only to criminal cases and the Seventh

to suits at common law, but the due process clause is available if needed.

may be imprisoned for the term of the grand jury, which can be 36 months. 18 U.S.C.

expansion of jury trial rights may have halted with McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403
U.S. 528 (1971).
