was instituted to decide the “dispute.” Declaring that “the whole
proceeding was in contempt of the court, and highly reprehen-
sible,” the Court observed: “The contract set out in the pleadings
was made for the purpose of instituting this suit. . . . The plaintiff
and defendant are attempting to procure the opinion of this court
upon a question of law, in the decision of which they have a com-
mon interest opposed to that of other persons, who are not parties
to the suit. . . . And their conduct is the more objectionable, be-
cause they have brought up the question upon a statement of facts
agreed upon between themselves . . . and upon a judgment pro forma
entered by their mutual consent, without any actual judicial deci-
sion. . . .” 365 “Whenever,” said the Court in another case, “in pur-
suance of an honest and actual antagonistic assertion of rights by
one individual against another, there is presented a question involv-
ing the validity of any act of any legislature, State or federal, and
the decision necessarily rests on the competency of the legislature
to so enact, the court must . . . determine whether the act be con-
stitutional or not; but such an exercise of power is the ultimate and
supreme function of courts. It is legitimate only in the last resort,
and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital
controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by
means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could trans-
fer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legis-
lative act.” 366 Yet several widely known constitutional decisions have
been rendered in cases in which friendly parties contrived to have
the actions brought and in which the suits were supervised and fi-
nanced by one side.367 There are also instances in which there may
not be in fact an adverse party at certain stages; that is, instances
when the parties do not actually disagree, but where the Supreme
Court and the lower courts are empowered to adjudicate.368

10 U.S. (6 Cr.) 87 (1810); Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857); cf. 1 C.
Warren, supra at 147, 392–95; 2 id. at 279–82. In Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514
(1968), the Court adjudicated on the merits a challenge to the constitutionality of
criminal treatment of chronic alcoholics although the findings of the trial court, agreed
to by the parties, appeared rather to be “the premises of a syllogism transparently
designed to bring this case” within the confines of an earlier enunciated constitu-
tional principle. But adversity arguably still existed.

entry of judgment by default or on a plea of guilty, In re Metropolitan Ry. Receiver-
ship, 208 U.S. 90 (1908), and consideration by the Court of cases in which the Solici-
