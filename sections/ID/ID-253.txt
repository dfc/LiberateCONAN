be removed by the defendant from the state court to the federal
court.1400 Generally, as Congress expanded the original jurisdiction
of the inferior federal courts, it similarly expanded removal jurisdic-
tion.1401 Although there is potentiality for intra-court conflict here,
of course, in the implied mistrust of state courts’ willingness or abil-
ity to protect federal interests, it is rather with regard to the lim-
ited areas of removal that do not correspond to federal court origi-
nal jurisdiction that the greatest amount of conflict is likely to arise.
    If a federal officer is sued or prosecuted in a state court for acts
done under color of law 1402 or if a federal employee is sued for a
wrongful or negligent act that the Attorney General certifies was
done while she was acting within the scope of her employment,1403
the actions may be removed. But the statute most open to federal-
state court dispute is the civil rights removal law, which authorizes
removal of any action, civil or criminal, which is commenced in a
state court “[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce
in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the
equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons
within the jurisdiction thereof.” 1404 In the years after enactment of
this statute, however, the court narrowly construed the removal privi-


     1400 § 12, 1 Stat. 79. The removal provision contained the same jurisdictional

amount requirement as the original jurisdictional statute. It applied in the main to
aliens and defendants not residents of the state in which suit was brought.
     1401 Thus the Act of March 3, 1875, § 2, 18 Stat. 470, conferring federal ques-

tion jurisdiction on the inferior federal courts, provided for removal of such actions.
The constitutionality of congressional authorization for removal is well-established.

nessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. 257 (1880); Ames v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, 111 U.S. 449

     1402 See 28 U.S.C. § 1442. This statute had its origins in the Act of February 4,

1815, § 8, 3 Stat. 198 (removal of civil and criminal actions against federal customs
officers for official acts), and the Act of March 2, 1833, § 3, 4 Stat. 633 (removal of
civil and criminal actions against federal officers on account of acts done under the
revenue laws), both of which grew out of disputes arising when certain states at-
tempted to nullify federal laws, and the Act of March 3, 1863, § 5, 12 Stat. 756 (re-
moval of civil and criminal actions against federal officers for acts done during the
existence of the Civil War under color of federal authority). In Mesa v. California,
489 U.S. 121 (1989), the Court held that the statute authorized federal officer re-
moval only when the defendant avers a federal defense. See Willingham v. Morgan,
395 U.S. 402 (1969).
     1403 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d), enacted after Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.S. 292 (1988).
     1404 28 U.S.C. § 1443(1). Subsection (2) provides for the removal of state court

actions “[f]or any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for
equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsis-
tent with such law.” This subsection “is available only to federal officers and to per-
sons assisting such officers in the performance of their official duties.” City of Green-
wood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 815 (1966).
