mistake, but have made a very clear one,—so clear that it is not
open to rational question.” 727 Whether phrased this way or phrased
so that a statute is not to be voided unless it is unconstitutional
beyond all reasonable doubt, the rule is of ancient origin 728 and of
modern adherence.729 In operation, however, the rule is subject to
two influences, which seriously impair its efficacy as a limitation.
First, the conclusion that there has been a clear mistake or that
there is no reasonable doubt is that drawn by five Justices if a full
Court sits. If five Justices of learning and detachment to the Con-
stitution are convinced that a statute is invalid and if four others
of equal learning and attachment are convinced it is valid, the con-
victions of the five prevail over the convictions or doubts of the four.
Second, the Court has at times made exceptions to the rule in cer-
tain categories of cases. Statutory interferences with “liberty of con-
tract” were once presumed to be unconstitutional until proved to
be valid; 730 more recently, presumptions of invalidity have ex-
pressly or impliedly been applied against statutes alleged to inter-
fere with freedom of expression and of religious freedom, which have
been said to occupy a “preferred position” in the constitutional scheme
of things.731
    Exclusion of Extra-Constitutional Tests.—Another maxim of
constitutional interpretation is that courts are concerned only with
the constitutionality of legislation and not with its motives, policy,
or wisdom,732 or with its concurrence with natural justice, funda-
mental principles of government, or the spirit of the Constitu-

     730 “But freedom of contract is, nevertheless, the general rule and restraint the

exception; and the exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only
by the existence of exceptional circumstances.” Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261
U.S. 525, 546 (1923).
     731 Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 88 (1949). Justice Frankfurter’s concurrence,

id. at 89–97, is a lengthy critique and review of the “preferred position” cases up to
that time. The Court has not used the expression in recent years but the worth it
attributes to the values of free expression probably approaches the same result. To-
day, the Court’s insistence on a “compelling state interest” to justify a governmental
decision to classify persons by “suspect” categories, such as race, Loving v. Virginia,
388 U.S. 1 (1967), or to restrict the exercise of a “fundamental” interest, such as the
right to vote, Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621 (1969), or the right
to travel, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), clearly imports presumption of
unconstitutionality.

the wisdom of this legislation, but on that point we have no concern.” Noble State
Bank v. Haskell, 219 U.S. 104 (1911) (Justice Holmes for the Court). See also Trop
v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 120 (1958) (Justice Frankfurter dissenting).
