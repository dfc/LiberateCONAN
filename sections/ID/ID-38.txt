to punish a person summarily and a multiplying of the due process
requirements that must otherwise be met when finding an indi-
vidual to be in contempt.189
    The Act of 1789.—The summary power of the courts of the United
States to punish contempts of their authority had its origin in the
law and practice of England where disobedience of court orders was
regarded as contempt of the King himself and attachment was a
prerogative process derived from presumed contempt of the sover-
eign.190 By the latter part of the eighteenth century, summary power
to punish was extended to all contempts whether committed in or
out of court.191 In the United States, the Judiciary Act of 1789 192
conferred power on all courts of the United States “to punish by
fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts
of authority in any cause or hearing before the same.” The only limi-
tation placed on this power was that summary attachment was made
a negation of all other modes of punishment. The abuse of this ex-
tensive power led, following the unsuccessful impeachment of Judge
James H. Peck of the Federal District Court of Missouri, to the pas-
sage of the Act of 1831 limiting the power of the federal courts to
punish contempts to misbehavior in the presence of the courts, “or
so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice,” to the
misbehavior of officers of courts in their official capacity, and to dis-
obedience or resistance to any lawful writ, process or order of the
court.193
    An Inherent Power.—The nature of the contempt power was
described Justice Field, writing for the Court in Ex parte Robin-
son,194 sustaining the act of 1831: “The power to punish for contempts
is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to the preserva-
tion of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of the
    189 Many of the limitations placed on the inferior federal courts have been is-

sued on the basis of the Supreme Court’s supervisory power over them rather than
upon a constitutional foundation, while, of course, the limitations imposed on state
courts necessarily are on constitutional dimensions. Indeed, it is often the case that
a limitation, which is applied to an inferior federal court as a superintending mea-
sure, is then transformed into a constitutional limitation and applied to state courts.
Compare Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373 (1966), with Bloom v. Illinois, 391
U.S. 194 (1968). In the latter stage, the limitations then bind both federal and state
courts alike. Therefore, in this section, Supreme Court constitutional limitations on
state court contempt powers are cited without restriction for equal application to
federal courts.
