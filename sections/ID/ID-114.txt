civil cases, the rule is: “When this Court applies a rule of federal
law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpreta-
tion of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all
cases open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether
such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.” 604
Four Justices continued to adhere to Chevron Oil, however,605 so
that with one Justice each retired from the different sides one may
not regard the issue as definitively settled.606 Future cases must,
therefore, be awaited for resolution of this issue.

Political Questions
     In some cases, a court will refuse to adjudicate a case despite
the fact that it presents all the qualifications that we have consid-
ered to make it a justiciable controversy; it is in its jurisdiction,
presented by parties with standing, and it is a case in which ad-
verseness and ripeness exist. Such are cases that present a “politi-
cal question.” Although the Court has referred to the political ques-
tion doctrine as “one of the rules basic to the federal system and
this Court’s appropriate place within that structure,” 607 it has also
been remarked that “[i]t is, measured by any of the normal respon-
sibilities of a phrase of definition, one of the least satisfactory terms

     604 509 U.S. at 97. Although the conditional language in this passage might sug-

gest that the Court was leaving open the possibility that in some cases it might
rule purely prospectively, and not even apply its decision to the parties before it,
other language belies that possibility. “This rule extends Griffith’s ban against ‘selec-
tive application of new rules.’ ” (Citing Griffith, 479 U.S. at 323.) Because Griffith
rested in part on the principle that “the nature of judicial review requires that [the
Court] adjudicate specific cases,” 479 U.S. at 322, deriving from Article III’s case or
controversy requirement for federal courts and forbidding federal courts from acting
legislatively, “ ‘the Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in
criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differ-
ently.’ ” 509 U.S. at 97 (quoting Smith, 496 U.S. at 214 (Justice Stevens dissent-
ing)). The point is made more clearly in Justice Scalia’s concurrence, in which he
denounces all forms of nonretroactivity as “the handmaid of judicial activism.” Id.
at 105.
     605 509 U.S. at 110 (Justice Kennedy, with Justice White, concurring); 113 (Jus-

tice O’Connor, with Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting). However, these Justices dis-
agreed in this case about the proper application of Chevron Oil.
     606 But see Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U.S. 749 (1995) (setting aside

a state court refusal to give retroactive effect to a U.S. Supreme Court invalidation
of that state’s statute of limitations in certain suits, in an opinion by Justice Breyer,
Justice Blackmun’s successor); Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S. 177, 184–85 (1995)
(“whatever the continuing validity of Chevron Oil after” Harper and Reynoldsville
Casket).
     607 Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 570 (1947); cf. Baker v. Carr,

369 U.S. 186, 278 (1962) (Justice Frankfurter dissenting). The most successful ef-
fort at conceptualization of the doctrine is Scharpf, Judicial Review and the Politi-
cal Question: A Functional Analysis, 75 YALE L.J. 517 (1966). See Hart & Wechsler
(6th ed.), supra at 222–248.
