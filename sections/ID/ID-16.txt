in other words, is inherently judicial, and other acts that Congress
may vest in courts or in other agencies. “[T]here are matters, involv-
ing public rights, which may be presented in such form that the
judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are suscep-
tible of judicial determination, but which Congress may or may not
bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as
it may deem proper.” 68
     In essence, the Court distinguished between those acts that his-
torically had been determined by courts and those that had both
been historically resolved by executive or legislative acts and com-
prehended matters that arose between the government and others.
Thus, Article I courts “may be created as special tribunals to exam-
ine and determine various matters, arising between the govern-
ment and others, which from their nature do not require judicial
determination and yet are susceptible of it. The mode of determin-
ing matters of this class is completely within congressional con-
trol.” 69 Among the matters susceptible of judicial determination, but
not requiring it, are claims against the United States,70 the dis-
posal of public lands and claims arising therefrom,71 questions con-
cerning membership in the Indian tribes,72 and questions arising
out of the administration of the customs and internal revenue laws.73
Other courts similar to territorial courts, such as consular courts
and military courts martial, may be justified on like grounds.74
    The impact of the “public rights” distinction, however, has var-
ied dramatically over time. In Crowell v. Benson,75 the Court ap-
proved an administrative scheme for determining, subject to judi-
cial review, maritime employee compensation claims, although it
acknowledged that the case involved “one of private right, that is,
of the liability of one individual to another under the law as de-
