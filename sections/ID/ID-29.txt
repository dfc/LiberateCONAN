stance arose when the Court unexpectedly recognized a statute of
limitations for certain securities actions that was shorter than what
had been recognized in many jurisdictions, resulting in the dis-
missal of several suits, which then become final because they were
not appealed. Congress subsequently enacted a statute that, though
not changing the limitations period prospectively, retroactively ex-
tended the time for suits that had been dismissed and provided for
the reopening of these final judgments. In Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,
Inc.,143 the Court invalidated the statute, holding it impermissible
for Congress to disturb a final judgment. “Having achieved finality,
. . . a judicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial depart-
ment with regard to a particular case or controversy, and Congress
may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable
to that very case was something other than what the courts said it
was.” 144 In Miller v. French,145 by contrast, the Court ruled that
the Prison Litigation Reform Act’s automatic stay of ongoing injunc-
tions remedying violations of prisoners’ rights did not amount to
an unconstitutional legislative revision of a final judgment. Rather,
the automatic stay merely altered “the prospective effect” of injunc-
tions, and it is well established that such prospective relief “re-
mains subject to alteration due to changes in the underlying law.” 146
    “Shall Be Vested”.—The distinction between judicial power and
jurisdiction is especially pertinent to the meaning of the words “shall
be vested” in § 1. Whereas all the judicial power of the United States
is vested in the Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts cre-
ated by Congress, neither has ever been vested with all the juris-
diction which could be granted and, Justice Story to the con-
trary,147 the Constitution has not been read to require that Congress
confer the entire jurisdiction it might.148 Thus, except for the origi-
nal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which flows directly from the
Constitution, two prerequisites to jurisdiction must be present: first,
the Constitution must have given the courts the capacity to receive
composed of “inferior courts” and “one Supreme Court.” “Within that hierarchy, the
decision of an inferior court is not (unless the time for appeal has expired) the final
word of the department as a whole.” Id. at 227.
