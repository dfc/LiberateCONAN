     In the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA),1396 Congress imposed tight new restrictions on succes-
sive or abusive petitions, including making the circuit courts “gate
keepers” in permitting or denying the filing of such petitions, with
bars to appellate review of these decisions, provisions that in part
were upheld in Felker v. Turpin.1397 One important restriction in
AEDPA bars a federal habeas court from granting a writ to any per-
son in custody under a judgment of a state court “with respect to
any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-
ings unless the adjudication of the claim—(1) resulted in a decision
that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States.” 1398 The Court has made the significance of
this restriction plain: Instead of assessing whether federal law was
correctly applied de novo, as would be the course under direct re-
view of a federal district court decision, the proper approach for fed-
eral habeas relief under AEDPA is the more deferential one of de-
termining whether the Court has established clear precedent on the
issue contested and, if so, whether the state’s application of the prec-
edent was reasonable, i.e., no fairminded jurist could find that the
state acted in accord with the Court’s established precedent.1399
     For the future, barring changes in Court membership, other cur-
tailing of habeas jurisdiction can be expected. Perhaps the Court
will impose some form of showing of innocence as a predicate to
obtaining a hearing. More far-reaching would be an overturning of
Brown v. Allen itself and the renunciation of any oversight, save
for the extremely limited direct review of state court convictions in
the Supreme Court. The Court continues to emphasize broad feder-
alism concerns, rather than simply comity and respect for state courts.
     Removal.—In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress provided that
civil actions commenced in the state courts which could have been
brought in the original jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts could
