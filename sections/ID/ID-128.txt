and prior to Marbury the power seems very generally to have been
assumed to exist by the Justices themselves.685 In enacting the Ju-
diciary Act of 1789, Congress explicitly provided for the exercise of
the power,686 and in other debates questions of constitutionality and
of judicial review were prominent.687 Nonetheless, although judi-
cial review is consistent with several provisions of the Constitution
and the argument for its existence may be derived from them, these
provisions do not compel the conclusion that the Framers intended
judicial review nor that it must exist. It was Chief Justice Mar-
ing them; and as the courts are generally the last in making the decision, it results
to them by refusing or not refusing to execute a law, to stamp it with the final char-
acter. This makes the Judiciary Department paramount in fact to the legislature,
which was never intended and can never be proper.” Id. at 294. At the height of the
dispute over the Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison authored a resolution ultimately
passed by the Virginia legislature which, though milder, and more restrained than
one authored by Jefferson and passed by the Kentucky legislature, asserted the power
of the states, though not of one state or of the state legislatures alone, to “inter-
pose” themselves to halt the application of an unconstitutional law. 3 I. BRANT, JAMES
MADISON: FATHER OF THE CONSTITUTION, 1787–1800 460–464, 467–471 (1950); Report on
the Resolutions of 1798, 6 Writings of James Madison, op. cit., 341–406. Embar-
rassed by the claim of the nullificationists in later years that his resolution sup-
ported their position, Madison distinguished his and their positions and again as-
serted his belief in judicial review. 6 I. Brant, supra, 481–485, 488–489.
     The various statements made and positions taken by the Framers have been
culled and categorized and argued over many times. For a recent compilation review-
ing the previous efforts, see R. Berger, supra, chs. 3–4.
     685 Thus, the Justices on circuit refused to administer a pension act on the grounds

of its unconstitutionally, see Hayburn’s Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409 (1792), and “Final-
ity of Judgment as an Attribute of Judicial Power,” supra. Chief Justice Jay and
other Justices wrote that the imposition of circuit duty on Justices was unconstitu-
tional, although they never mailed the letter, supra, in Hylton v. United States, 3
U.S. (3 Dall.) 171 (1796), a feigned suit, the constitutionality of a federal law was
argued before the Justices and upheld on the merits, in Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3
Dall.) 199 (1797), a state law was overturned, and dicta in several opinions asserted
the principle. See Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 399 (1798) (Justice Iredell),
and several Justices on circuit, quoted in J. Goebel, supra, at 589–592.
     686 In enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, Congress chose not to vest

“federal question” jurisdiction in the federal courts but to leave to the state courts
the enforcement of claims under the Constitution and federal laws. In § 25, 1 Stat.
85, Congress provided for review by the Supreme Court of final judgments in state
courts (1) “. . . where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or
an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their
validity;” (2) “. . . where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an au-
thority exercised under any State, on the ground of their being repugnant to the
constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of
their validity;” or (3) “. . . where is drawn in question the construction of any clause
of the constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under the United
States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially
set up or claimed” thereunder. The ruling below was to be “re-examined and re-
versed or affirmed in the Supreme Court . . . .”
     687 See in particular the debate on the President’s removal powers, discussed

supra, “The Removal Power” with statements excerpted in R. Berger, supra at 144–
150. Debates on the Alien and Sedition Acts and on the power of Congress to repeal
the Judiciary Act of 1801 similarly saw recognition of judicial review of acts of Con-
gress. C. Warren, supra at 107–124.
