enforce “penal” laws of the United States; the statute at issue in
the case provided “that a buyer of goods at above the prescribed
ceiling price may sue the seller ‘in any court of competent jurisdic-
tion.’ ” 1269 Respecting Rhode Island’s claim that one sovereign can-
not enforce the penal laws of another, Justice Black observed that
the assumption underlying this claim flew “in the face of the fact
that the States of the Union constitute a nation” and the fact of
the existence of the Supremacy Clause.1270
    State Interference with Federal Jurisdiction.—It seems
settled, though not without dissent, that state courts have no power
to enjoin proceedings 1271 or effectuation of judgments 1272 of the fed-
eral courts, with the exception of cases in which a state court has
custody of property in proceedings in rem or quasi in rem, where
the state court has exclusive jurisdiction to proceed and may en-
join parties from further action in federal court.1273

Conflicts of Jurisdiction: Rules of Accommodation
    Federal courts primarily interfere with state courts in three ways:
by enjoining proceedings in them, by issuing writs of habeas cor-
pus to set aside convictions obtained in them, and by adjudicating
cases removed from them. With regard to all three but particularly

    1269  330 U.S. at 387.
    1270  330 U.S. at 389. See, for a discussion as well as an extension of Testa, FERC
v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742 (1982). Cases since Testa requiring state court enforce-
ment of federal rights have generally concerned federal remedial laws. E.g., Charles
Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502 (1962); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park,
396 U.S. 229 (1969). The Court has approved state court adjudication under 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983, Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 3 n.1 (1980), but, curiously, in Martinez v.
California, 444 U.S. 277, 283 n.7 (1980) (emphasis by Court), it noted that it has
“never considered . . . the question whether a State must entertain a claim under
1983.” See also Arkansas Writers’ Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 234 n.7
(1987) (continuing to reserve question). But, with Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131 (1988),
and Howlett by Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356 (1990), it seems dubious that state
courts could refuse. Enforcement is not limited to federal statutory law; federal com-
mon law must similarly be enforced. Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663 (1962).
     1271 Donovan v. City of Dallas, 377 U.S. 408 (1964), and cases cited. Justices

Harlan, Clark, and Stewart dissented, arguing that a state should have power to
enjoin vexatious, duplicative litigation which would have the effect of thwarting a
state-court judgment already entered. See also Baltimore & Ohio R.R. v. Kepner,
314 U.S. 44, 56 (1941) (Justice Frankfurter dissenting). In Riggs v. Johnson County,
73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 166 (1868), the general rule was attributed to the complete inde-
pendence of state and federal courts in their spheres of action, but federal courts, of
course may under certain circumstances enjoin actions in state courts.
     1272 McKim v. Voorhies, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 279 (1812); Riggs v. Johnson County, 73

U.S. (6 Wall.) 166 (1868).
     1273 Princess Lida v. Thompson, 305 U.S. 456 (1939). Nor do state courts have

any power to release by habeas corpus persons in custody pursuant to federal author-
ity. Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506 (1859); Tarble’s Case, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.)
397 (1872).
