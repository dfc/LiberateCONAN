Lynaugh.594 Thus, for collateral review in federal courts of state court
criminal convictions, the general rule is that “new rules” of consti-
tutional interpretation—those “not ‘dictated by precedent existing
at the time the defendant’s conviction became final’ ” 595—will not
be applied.596 “A new rule applies retroactively in a collateral pro-
ceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a ‘water-
shed rul[e] of criminal procedure’ implicating the fundamental fair-
ness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.” 597
     What the rule is to be, and indeed if there is to be a rule, in
civil cases has been disputed to a rough draw in recent cases. As
was noted above, there is a line of civil cases, constitutional and
nonconstitutional, in which the Court has declined to apply new rules,
the result often of overruling older cases, retrospectively, some-
times even to the prevailing party in the case.598 As in criminal cases,

    595  Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007). Put another way, it is not
enough that a decision is “within the ‘logical compass’ of an earlier decision, or in-
deed that it is ‘controlled’ by a prior decision.” A decision announces a “new rule” if
its result “was susceptible to debate among reasonable minds” and if it was not “an
illogical or even a grudging application” of the prior decision. Butler v. McKellar,
494 U.S. 407, 412–415 (1990). For additional elaboration on “new law,” see O’Dell v.
Netherland, 521 U.S. 151 (1997); Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518 (1997); Gray
v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152 (1996). But compare Bousley v. Brooks, 523 U.S. 614
(1998).
     596 The approach in state collateral review proceedings, however, may be differ-

ent. The Court has indicated that the general rule regarding denial of retroactive
application of “new rules” in federal collateral proceeding was principally based on
an interpretation of federal statutory law. State collateral review of cases brought
under state law may be more generous to the defendant. Danforth v. Minnesota,
552 U.S. 264 (2008).
     For an example of the application of the Teague rule in federal collateral review
of a federal court conviction, see Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–820,
slip op. (2013).
     597 Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007). Put another way, a new rule

will be applied in a collateral proceeding only if it places certain kinds of conduct
“beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to prescribe” or constitutes
a “new procedure[ ] without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seri-
ously diminished.” Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 307, 311–313 (1989) (plurality opin-
ion); Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415–416 (1990). Under the second exception
it is “not enough under Teague to say that a new rule is aimed at improving the
accuracy of a trial. More is required. A rule that qualifies under this exception must
not only improve accuracy, but also ‘alter our understanding of the bedrock proce-
dural elements’ essential to the fairness of a proceeding.” Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S.
227, 242 (1990) (emphasis in original, internal quotation marks omitted). For recent
application of the principles, see Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004) (require-
ment that aggravating factors justifying death penalty be found by the jury was a
new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively).
     598 The standard that has been applied was enunciated in Chevron Oil Co. v.

Huson, 404 U.S. 97 (1971). Briefly, the question of retroactivity or prospectivity was
to be determined by a balancing of the equities. To be limited to prospectivity, a
decision must have established a new principle of law, either by overruling clear
past precedent on which reliance has been had or by deciding an issue of first im-
