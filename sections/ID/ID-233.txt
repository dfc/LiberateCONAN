in statutory language,1296 or through Court interpretation.1297 The
Court’s general policy of application, however, seems to a consider-
able degree to effectuate what is now at least the major rationale
of the statute, deference to state court adjudication of issues pre-
sented to them for decision.1298
     Res Judicata.—Both the Constitution and a contemporane-
ously enacted statute require federal courts to give “full faith and
credit” to state court judgments, to give, that is, preclusive effect to
state court judgments when those judgments would be given preclu-
sive effect by the courts of that state.1299 The present Court views
the interpretation of “full faith and credit” in the overall context of
deference to state courts running throughout this section. “Thus,
res judicata and collateral estoppel not only reduce unnecessary liti-
gation and foster reliance on adjudication, but also promote the co-
mity between state and federal courts that has been recognized as
a bulwark of the federal system.” 1300 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is not an

     1296 The greatest difficulty is with the “expressly authorized by Act of Congress”

exception. No other Act of Congress expressly refers to § 2283 and the Court has
indicated that no such reference is necessary to create a statutory exception. Amal-
gamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros., 348 U.S. 511, 516 (1955). Compare Capi-
tal Service, Inc. v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 501 (1954). Rather, “in order to qualify as an
‘expressly authorized’ exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress
must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or remedy, enforceable in a
federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empow-
ered to enjoin a state court proceeding.” Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 237 (1972).
Applying this test, the Court in Mitchum held that a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit is an
exception to § 2283 and that persons suing under this authority may, if they satisfy
the requirements of comity, obtain an injunction against state court proceedings. The
exception is, of course, highly constrained by the comity principle. On the difficulty
of applying the test, see Vendo Co. v. Lektco-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623 (1977) (frag-
mented Court on whether Clayton Act authorization of private suits for injunctive
relief is an “expressly authorized” exception to § 2283).
     On the interpretation of the § 2283 exception for injunctions to protect or effec-
tuate a federal-court judgment, see Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U.S. 140
(1988).
     1297 Thus, the Act bars federal court restraint of pending state court proceed-

ings but not restraint of the institution of such proceedings. Dombrowski v. Pfister,
380 U.S. 479, 484 n.2 (1965). Restraint is not barred if sought by the United States
or an officer or agency of the United States. Leiter Minerals v. United States, 352
U.S. 220 (1957); NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U.S. 138 (1971). Restraint is not barred
if the state court proceeding is not judicial but rather administrative. Prentis v. At-
lantic Coast Line Co., 211 U.S. 210 (1908); Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S. 15 (1972).
Compare Hill v. Martin, 296 U.S. 393, 403 (1935), with Lynch v. Household Finance
Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 552–56 (1972).
     1298 The statute is to be applied “to prevent needless friction between state and

federal courts.” Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., 309 U.S. 4,
9 (1940); Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S.
281, 285–86 (1970).
     1299 Article IV, § 1, of the Constitution; 28 U.S.C. § 1738.
