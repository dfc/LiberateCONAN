decide the issues.550 Should this analysis prevail, ripeness as a limi-
tation on justiciability will decline in importance.
    Mootness.—A case initially presenting all the attributes neces-
sary for federal court litigation may at some point lose some attri-
bute of justiciability and become “moot.” The usual rule is that an
actual controversy must exist at all stages of trial and appellate
consideration and not simply at the date the action is initiated.551
“Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts may adjudi-
cate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies. . . . Article III de-
nies federal courts the power ‘to decide questions that cannot affect
the rights of litigants in the case before them,’ . . . and confines
them to resolving ‘real and substantial controvers[ies] admitting of
specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distin-
guished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a
hypothetical state of facts.’ This case-or-controversy requirement sub-
sists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and ap-
pellate. To sustain our jurisdiction in the present case, it is not enough
that a dispute was very much alive when suit was filed, or when
review was obtained in the Court of Appeals. . . . The parties must
continue to have a ‘personal stake in the outcome’ of the law-

(1978). The injury giving standing to plaintiffs was the environmental harm arising
from the plant’s routine operation; the injury to their legal rights was alleged to be
the harm caused by the limitation of liability in the event of a nuclear accident. The
standing injury had occurred, the ripeness injury was conjectural and speculative
and might never occur. See id. at 102 (Justice Stevens concurring in the result). It
is evident on the face of the opinion and expressly stated by the objecting Justices
that the Court used its standing/ripeness analyses in order to reach the merits, so
as to remove the constitutional cloud cast upon the federal law by the district court
decision. Id. at 95, 103 (Justices Rehnquist and Stevens concurring in the result).

394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969); SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, 404 U.S.
403 (1972); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393,
398–399 (1975) (special rule for class actions); United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty,
445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980) (special rule for class actions), and id. at 411 (Justice Pow-
ell dissenting); Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987); Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S.
305, 317 (1988); Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477–478 (1990);
Camreta V. Greene, 563 U.S. ___, No. 09–1954, slip op. (2011); United States v. Ju-
venile Male, 564 U.S. ___, No. 09–940, slip op. at 4 (2011). Munsingwear has long
stood for the proposition that the appropriate practice of the Court in a civil case
that had become moot while on the way to the Court or after certiorari had been
granted was to vacate or reverse and remand with directions to dismiss. In U.S.
Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18 (1994), however, the
Court held that when mootness occurs because the parties have reached a settle-
ment, vacatur of the judgment below is ordinarily not the best practice; instead, eq-
uitable principles should be applied so as to preserve a presumptively correct and
valuable precedent, unless a court concludes that the public interest would be served
by vacatur.
