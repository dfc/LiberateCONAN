    Cases may become moot because of a change in the law,556 or
in the status of the parties,557 or because of some act of one of the
parties which dissolves the controversy.558 But the Court has devel-
oped several exceptions. Thus, in criminal cases, although the sen-
tence of the convicted appellant has been served, the case “is moot
only if it is shown that there is no possibility that any collateral
legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the challenged
conviction.” 559 The “mere possibility” of such a consequence, even a
“remote” one, is enough to find that one who has served his sen-
tence has retained the requisite personal stake giving his case “an
adversary cast and making it justiciable.” 560 This exception has its

(1852); United States v. Alaska Steamship Co., 253 U.S. 113 (1920); Hall v. Beals,
396 U.S. 45 (1969); Sanks v. Georgia, 401 U.S. 144 (1971); Richardson v. Wright,
405 U.S. 208 (1972); Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, 404 U.S. 412 (1972);
Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 481 (1990). But compare Decker v. North-
west Environmental Defense Center, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–338, slip op. (2013) (ac-
tion to enforce penalty under former regulation not mooted by change in regulation
where violation occurred before regulation was changed). See also City of Mesquite
v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 288–289 (1982) (case not mooted by repeal of
ordinance, since City made clear its intention to reenact it if free from lower court
judgment). Following Aladdin’s Castle, the Court in Northeastern Fla. Ch. of the
Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 660–63 (1993),
held that when a municipal ordinance is repealed but replaced by one sufficiently
similar so that the challenged action in effect continues, the case is not moot. But
see id. at 669 (Justice O’Connor dissenting) (modification of ordinance more signifi-
cant and case is mooted).
     557 Atherton Mills v. Johnston, 259 U.S. 13 (1922) (in challenge to laws regulat-

ing labor of youths 14 to 16, Court held case two-and-one-half years after argument
and dismissed as moot since certainly none of the challengers was now in the age
bracket); Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103 (1969); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S.
312 (1974); Dove v. United States, 423 U.S. 325 (1976); Lane v. Williams, 455 U.S.
624 (1982). Compare County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625 (1979), with Vitek
v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980). In Arizonans For Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S.
43 (1997), a state employee attacking an English-only work requirement had stand-
ing at the time she brought the suit, but she resigned following a decision in the
trial court, thus mooting the case before it was taken to the appellate court, which
should not have acted to hear and decide it.

Local 8–6 v. Missouri, 361 U.S. 363 (1960); A.L. Mechling Barge Lines v. United
States, 368 U.S. 324 (1961); Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395 (1975); County of Los
Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625 (1979); Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. ___, No. 08–351

     559 Sibron v. New York, 395 U.S. 40, 50–58 (1968). But compare Spencer v. Kemna,

523 U.S. 1 (1998).
     560 Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 790–791 (1969). The cases have pro-

gressed from leaning toward mootness to leaning strongly against. E.g., St. Pierre v.
United States, 319 U.S. 41 (1943); Fiswick v. United States, 329 U.S. 211 (1946);
United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502 (1954); Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S.
354 (1957); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 633–634 n.2 (1968); Sibron v. New
York, 392 U.S. 40, 49–58 (1968). But see Lane v. Williams, 455 U.S. 624 (1982);United
States v. Juvenile Male, 564 U.S. ___, No. 09–940, slip op. at 6 (2011) (per curiam)
(rejecting as too indirect a benefit that favorable resolution of a case might serve as
beneficial precedent for a future case involving the plaintiff). The exception permits
