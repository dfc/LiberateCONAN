only in admiralty would be tried without a jury.813 And a colorable
constitutional claim has been held to support jurisdiction over a fed-
eral statutory claim arguably not within federal jurisdiction.814
     Still another variant is the doctrine of “pendent parties,” under
which a federal court could take jurisdiction of a state claim against
one party if it were related closely enough to a federal claim against
another party, even though there was no independent jurisdic-
tional base for the state claim.815 Although the Supreme Court at
first tentatively found some merit in the idea,816 in Finley v. United
States,817 by a 5-to-4 vote the Court firmly disapproved of the pen-
dent party concept and cast considerable doubt on the other prongs
of pendent jurisdiction as well. Pendent party jurisdiction, Justice
Scalia wrote for the Court, was within the constitutional grant of
judicial power, but to be operable it must be affirmatively granted
by congressional enactment.818 Within the year, Congress supplied
the affirmative grant, adopting not only pendent party jurisdiction
but also codifying pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction un-
der the name of “supplemental jurisdiction.” 819
    Thus, these interrelated doctrinal standards now seem well-
grounded.
    Protective Jurisdiction.—A conceptually difficult doctrine, which
approaches the verge of a serious constitutional gap, is the concept
of protective jurisdiction. Under this doctrine, it is argued that in
instances in which Congress has legislative jurisdiction, it can con-
fer federal jurisdiction, with the jurisdictional statute itself being
the “law of the United States” within the meaning of Article III,
even though Congress has enacted no substantive rule of decision
and state law is to be applied. Put forward in controversial cases,820
the doctrine has neither been rejected nor accepted by the Su-

Court, despite the absence of language making § 1367 applicable, held that the stat-
ute gave district courts jurisdiction over state-law claims in cases originating in state
court and then removed to federal court.
