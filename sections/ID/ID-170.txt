whether or not a particular injury was also within the constitu-
tional reach of a state workmen’s compensation law or other law.
By the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA, Congress extended the
law shoreward by refining the tests of “employee” and “navigable
waters,” so as to reach piers, wharfs, and the like in certain circum-
stances.929
    (2) The passage of the Jones Act 930 gave seamen a statutory
right of recovery for negligently inflicted injuries on which they could
sue in state or federal courts. Because injured parties could obtain
a jury trial in Jones Act suits, there was little attempted recourse
under the savings clause 931 to state law claims and thus no need
to explore the line between applicable and inapplicable state law.
But in the 1940s personal injury actions based on unseaworthi-
ness 932 were given new life by Court decisions for seamen; 933 and
the right was soon extended to longshoremen who were injured while
on board ship or while working on the dock if the injury could be
attributed either to the ship’s gear or its cargo.934 While these ac-
tions could have been brought in state court, federal law sup-
planted state law even with regard to injuries sustained in state
territorial waters.935 The 1972 LHWCA amendments, however, elimi-



    929 86 Stat. 1251, § 2, amending 33 U.S.C. § 902. The Court had narrowly turned

back an effort to achieve this result through construction in Nacirema Operating
Co. v. Johnson, 396 U.S. 212 (1969). See also Victory Carriers v. Law, 404 U.S. 202
(1971). On the interpretation of the amendments, see Northeast Marine Terminal
Co. v. Caputo, 432 U.S. 249 (1977); Director, Office of Workers Compensation Pro-
grams v. Perini, 459 U.S. 297 (1983).

    931 “Cases of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction,” supra.
    932 Unseaworthiness “is essentially a species of liability without fault, analo-

gous to other well known instances in our law. Derived from and shaped to meet
the hazards which performing the service imposes, the liability is neither limited by
conceptions of negligence nor contractual in character. . . . [T]he owner’s duty to fur-
nish a seaworthy ship is absolute and completely independent of his duty under the
Jones Act to exercise reasonable care.” Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, 362 U.S. 539, 549
