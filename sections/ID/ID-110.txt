ties of the parties to the cases.579 The Court asserted that this prin-
ciple is true, while applying it only to give retroactive effect to the
parties to the immediate case.580 Yet, occasionally, the Court did not
apply its holding to the parties before it,581 and in a series of cases
beginning in the mid-1960s it became embroiled in attempts to limit
the retroactive effect of its—primarily but not exclusively 582—
constitutional-criminal law decisions. The results have been confus-
ing and unpredictable.583
    Prior to 1965, “both the common law and our own decisions rec-
ognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional
decisions of this Court . . . subject to [certain] limited excep-
tions.” 584 Statutory and judge-made law have consequences, at least
to the extent that people must rely on them in making decisions
and shaping their conduct. Therefore, the Court was moved to rec-
ognize that there should be a reconciling of constitutional interests
reflected in a new rule of law with reliance interests founded upon
the old.585 In both criminal and civil cases, however, the Court’s dis-
cretion to do so has been constrained by later decisions.
    In the 1960s, when the Court began its expansion of the Bill of
Rights and applied its rulings to the states, it became necessary to
determine the application of the rulings to criminal defendants who
had exhausted all direct appeals but who could still resort to ha-
beas corpus, to those who had been convicted but still were on di-
rect appeal, and to those who had allegedly engaged in conduct but

(1973); City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma,
395 U.S. 701 (1969). Indeed, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), and Northern
Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), the Court post-
poned the effectiveness of its decision for a period during which Congress could re-
pair the flaws in the statute. Noncriminal, nonconstitutional cases include Chevron
Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97 (1971); Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544

     583 Because of shifting coalitions of Justices, Justice Harlan complained, the course

of retroactivity decisions “became almost as difficult to follow as the tracks made by
a beast of prey in search of its intended victim.” Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S.
667, 676 (1971) (separate opinion).
     584 Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 507 (1973). The older rule of retroactivity

derived from the Blackstonian notion “that the duty of the court was not to ‘pro-
nounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.’ ” Linkletter v. Walker,
381 U.S. 618, 622–23 (1965) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *69).
