land patents issued to the state by the United States in breach of
its trust obligations to the Indian.959 In United States v. West Vir-
ginia,960 the Court refused to take jurisdiction of a suit in equity
brought by the United States to determine the navigability of the
New and Kanawha Rivers on the ground that the jurisdiction in
such suits is limited to cases and controversies and does not ex-
tend to the adjudication of mere differences of opinion between the
officials of the two governments. A few years earlier, however, it had
taken jurisdiction of a suit by the United States against Utah to
quiet title to land forming the beds of certain sections of the Colo-
rado River and its tributaries with the states.961 Similarly, it took
jurisdiction of a suit brought by the United States against Califor-
nia to determine the ownership of and paramount rights over the
submerged land and the oil and gas thereunder off the coast of Cali-
fornia between the low-water mark and the three-mile limit.962 Like
suits were decided against Louisiana and Texas in 1950.963
    Immunity of the United States From Suit.—Pursuant to the
general rule that a sovereign cannot be sued in its own courts, the
judicial power does not extend to suits against the United States
unless Congress by statute consents to such suits. This rule first
emanated in embryonic form in an obiter dictum by Chief Justice
Jay in Chisholm v. Georgia, where he indicated that a suit would
not lie against the United States because “there is no power which
the courts can call to their aid.” 964 In Cohens v. Virginia,965 also in
dictum, Chief Justice Marshall asserted, “the universally received
opinion is that no suit can be commenced or prosecuted against the
United States.” The issue was more directly in question in United
States v. Clarke,966 where Chief Justice Marshall stated that, as the
United States is “not suable of common right, the party who insti-
tutes such suit must bring his case within the authority of some
act of Congress, or the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over it.”
He thereupon ruled that the act of May 26, 1830, for the final settle-
ment of land claims in Florida condoned the suit. The doctrine of
the exemption of the United States from suit was repeated in vari-

    959 United States v. Minnesota, 270 U.S. 181 (1926). For an earlier suit against
