to enact restrictive habeas amendments.1365 Although the efforts were
unsuccessful, complaints were received more sympathetically in a
newly constituted Supreme Court and more restrictive rulings en-
sued.
    The discretion afforded the Court was sounded by Justice
Rehnquist, who, after reviewing the case law on the 1867 statute,
remarked that the history “illustrates this Court’s historic willing-
ness to overturn or modify its earlier views of the scope of the writ,
even where the statutory language authorizing judicial action has
remained unchanged.” 1366 The emphasis from early on has been upon
the equitable nature of the habeas remedy and the judiciary’s re-
sponsibility to guide the exercise of that remedy in accordance with
equitable principles; thus, the Court time and again underscores that
the federal courts have plenary power under the statute to imple-
ment it to the fullest while the Court’s decisions may deny them
the discretion to exercise the power.1367
    Change has occurred in several respects in regard to access to
and the scope of the writ. It is sufficient to say that the more re-
cent rulings have eviscerated the content of the 1963 trilogy and
that Brown v. Allen itself is threatened with extinction.
    First, the Court in search and seizure cases has returned to the
standard of Frank v. Mangum, holding that where the state courts
afford a criminal defendant the opportunity for a full and adequate
hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim, his only avenue of relief
in the federal courts is to petition the Supreme Court for review
     1365 In 1961, state prisoner habeas filings totaled 1,020, in 1965, 4,845, in 1970,

a high (to date) of 9,063, in 1975, 7,843 in 1980, 8,534 in 1985, 9,045 in 1986. On
relief afforded, no reliable figures are available, but estimates indicate that at most
4 percent of the filings result in either release or retrial. C. WRIGHT, A. MILLER, & E.
COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE (1988 & supps.), § 4261, at 284–91.
     1366 Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 81 (1977). The present Court’s emphasis

in habeas cases is, of course, quite different from that of the Court in the 1963 tril-
ogy. Now, the Court favors decisions that promote finality, comity, judicial economy,
and channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum. Keeney v.
Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, 8–10 (1992). Overall, federalism concerns are critical. See
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 726 (1991) (“This is a case about federalism.”
First sentence of opinion). The seminal opinion on which subsequent cases have drawn
is Justice Powell’s concurrence in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 250 (1973).
He suggested that habeas courts should entertain only those claims that go to the
integrity of the fact-finding process, thus raising questions of the value of a guilty
verdict, or, more radically, that only those prisoners able to make a credible show-
ing of “factual innocence” could be heard on habeas. Id. at 256–58, 274–75. As will
be evident infra, some form of innocence standard now is pervasive in much of the
Court’s habeas jurisprudence.
     1367 433 U.S. at 83; Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 495 n.37 (1976); Francis v.

Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 538 (1976); Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438 (1963). The
dichotomy between power and discretion goes all the way back to the case imposing
the rule of exhaustion of state remedies. Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251 (1886).
