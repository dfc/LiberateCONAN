                         COMPENSATION OF JUDGES
           The Constitution is almost completely silent concerning the or-
       ganization of the federal judiciary. “That there should be a national
       judiciary was readily accepted by all.” 1 But whether it was to con-
       sist of one high court at the apex of a federal judicial system or a
       high court exercising appellate jurisdiction over state courts that
       would initially hear all but a minor fraction of cases raising na-
       tional issues was a matter of considerable controversy.2 The Vir-
       ginia Plan provided for a “National judiciary [to] be established to
       consist of one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior tribunals
       to be chosen by the National Legislature . . . .” 3 In the Committee
       of the Whole, the proposition “that a national judiciary be estab-
       lished” was unanimously adopted,4 but the clause “to consist of One
       supreme tribunal, and of one or more inferior tribunals” 5 was first
       agreed to, then reconsidered. The provision for inferior tribunals was
       ultimately stricken out, it being argued that state courts could ad-
       equately adjudicate all necessary matters while the supreme tribu-
       nal would protect the national interest and assure uniformity.6 Wil-
