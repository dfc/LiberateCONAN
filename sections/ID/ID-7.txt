nal statutes of the United States.13 Originally, the Court consisted
of a Chief Justice and five Associate Justices.14 The number was
gradually increased until it reached a total of ten under the act of
March 3, 1863.15 As one of the Reconstruction Congress’s restric-
tions on President Andrew Johnson, the number was reduced to seven
as vacancies should occur.16 The number actually never fell below
eight before the end of Johnson’s term, and Congress thereupon made
the number nine.17
    Proposals have been made at various times for an organization
of the Court into sections or divisions. No authoritative judicial ex-
pression is available, but Chief Justice Hughes, in a letter to Sena-
tor Wheeler in 1937, expressed doubts concerning the validity of
such a device and stated that “the Constitution does not appear to
authorize two or more Supreme Courts functioning in effect as sepa-
rate courts.” 18 Congress has also determined the time and place of
sessions of the Court. It exercised this power once to change the
Court’s term to forestall a constitutional attack on the repeal of the
Judiciary Act of 1801, with the result that the Court did not con-
vene for fourteen months.19

Inferior Courts
    Congress also provided in the Judiciary Act of 1789 for the cre-
ation of courts inferior to the Supreme Court. Thirteen district courts
were constituted to have four sessions annually,20 and three circuit
courts were established. The circuit courts were to consist of two
Supreme Court justices each and one of the district judges of such
districts, and were to meet twice annually in the various districts
comprising the circuit.21 This system had substantial faults in op-
eration, not the least of which was the burden imposed on the Jus-
tices, who were required to travel thousands of miles each year un-
