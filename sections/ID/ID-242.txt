Then, eight years later, in Moore v. Dempsey,1349 involving another
conviction in a trial in which the court was alleged to have been
influenced by a mob and in which the state appellate court had heard
and rejected Moore’s contentions, the Court directed that the fed-
eral district judge himself determine the merits of the petitioner’s
allegations.
     Moreover, the Court shortly abandoned its emphasis upon want
of jurisdiction and held that the writ was available to consider con-
stitutional claims as well as questions of jurisdiction.1350 The land-
mark case was Brown v. Allen,1351 in which the Court laid down
several principles of statutory construction of the habeas statute.
First, all federal constitutional questions raised by state prisoners
are cognizable in federal habeas. Second, a federal court is not bound
by state court judgments on federal questions, even though the state
courts may have fully and fairly considered the issues. Third, a fed-
eral habeas court may inquire into issues of fact as well as of law,
although the federal court may defer to the state court if the pris-
oner received an adequate hearing. Fourth, new evidentiary hear-
ings must be held when there are unusual circumstances, when there
is a “vital flaw” in the state proceedings, or when the state court
record is incomplete or otherwise inadequate.
     Almost plenary federal habeas review of state court convictions
was authorized and rationalized in the Court’s famous “1963 tril-
ogy.” 1352 First, the Court dealt with the established principle that
a federal habeas court is empowered, where a prisoner alleges facts

    1350  Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275 (1941). See also Johnson v. Zerbst, 304
U.S. 458 (1938); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275 (1941). The way one reads the
history of the developments is inevitably a product of the philosophy one brings to
the subject. In addition to the recitations cited in other notes, compare Wright v.
West, 505 U.S. 277, 285–87 & n.3 (1992) (Justice Thomas for a plurality of the Court),
with id. at 297–301 (Justice O’Connor concurring).
     1351 344 U.S. 443 (1953). Brown is commonly thought to rest on the assumption

that federal constitutional rights cannot be adequately protected only by direct Su-
preme Court review of state court judgments but that independent review, on ha-
beas, must rest with federal judges. It is, of course, true that Brown coincided with
the extension of most of the Bill of Rights to the states by way of incorporation and
expansive interpretation of federal constitutional rights; previously, there was not a
substantial corpus of federal rights to protect through habeas. See Wright v. West,
505 U.S. 277, 297–99 (1992) (Justice O’Connor concurring). In Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S.
391 (1963), Justice Brennan, for the Court, and Justice Harlan, in dissent, engaged
in a lengthy, informed historical debate about the legitimacy of Brown and its prem-
ises. Compare id. at 401–24, with id. at 450–61. See the material gathered and cited
in Hart & Wechsler (6th ed.), supra at 1220–1248.
     1352 Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 (1963); Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391 (1963);

Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963). These cases dealt, respectively, with the treat-
ment to be accorded a habeas petition in the three principal categories in which
they come to the federal court: when a state court has rejected petitioner’s claims
on the merits, when a state court has refused to hear petitioner’s claims on the mer-
