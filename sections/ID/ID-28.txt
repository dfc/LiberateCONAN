bring a case before it for decision.” 131 It is “the right to determine
actual controversies arising between diverse litigants, duly insti-
tuted in courts of proper jurisdiction.” 132 The terms “judicial power”
and “jurisdiction” are frequently used interchangeably, with “juris-
diction” defined as the power to hear and determine the subject mat-
ter in controversy between parties to a suit 133 or as the “power to
entertain the suit, consider the merits and render a binding deci-
sion thereon.” 134 The cases and commentary however, support, in-
deed require, a distinction between the two concepts.
     Jurisdiction is the authority of a court to exercise judicial power
in a specific case and is, of course, a prerequisite to the exercise of
judicial power, which is the totality of powers a court exercises when
it assumes jurisdiction and hears and decides a case.135 Judicial power
confers on federal courts the power to decide a case and to render
a judgment that conclusively resolves a case. Included within the
general judicial power are the ancillary powers of courts to punish
for contempt of their authority,136 to issue writs in aid of jurisdic-
tion when authorized by statute,137 to make rules governing their
process in the absence of statutory authorizations or prohibi-
tions,138 to order their own process so as to prevent abuse, oppres-
sion, and injustice, and to protect their own jurisdiction and offi-
cers in the protection of property in custody of law,139 to appoint
masters in chancery, referees, auditors, and other investigators,140
and to admit and disbar attorneys.141
    As judicial power is the authority to render dispositive judg-
ments, Congress violates the separation of powers when it pur-
ports to alter final judgments of Article III courts.142 Once such in-

    142 Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218–19 (1995). The Court was

careful to delineate the difference between attempting to alter a final judgment, one
rendered by a court and either not appealed or affirmed on appeal, and legislatively
amending a statute so as to change the law as it existed at the time a court issued
a decision that was on appeal or otherwise still alive at the time a federal court
reviewed the determination below. A court must apply the law as revised when it
considers the prior interpretation. Id. at 226–27. Article III creates or authorizes
Congress to create not a collection of unconnected courts, but a judicial department
