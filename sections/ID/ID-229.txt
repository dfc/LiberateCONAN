with regard to the first, there have been developed certain rules
plus a statutory limitation designed to minimize needless conflict.
     Comity.—“[T]he notion of ‘comity,’ ” Justice Black asserted, is
composed of “a proper respect for state functions, a recognition of
the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate
state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the Na-
tional Government will fare best if the States and their institu-
tions are left free to perform their separate functions in their sepa-
rate ways. This, perhaps for lack of a better and clearer way to describe
it, is referred to by many as ‘Our Federalism’. . . .” 1274 Comity is a
self-imposed rule of judicial restraint whereby independent tribu-
nals of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction act to moderate the
stresses of coexistence and to avoid collisions of authority. It is not
a rule of law but “one of practice, convenience, and expediency,” 1275
which persuades but does not command.
    Abstention.—Perhaps the fullest expression of the concept of
comity may be found in the abstention doctrine. The abstention doc-
trine instructs federal courts to abstain from exercising jurisdiction
if applicable state law, which would be dispositive of the contro-
versy, is unclear and a state court interpretation of the state law
question might obviate the necessity of deciding a federal constitu-
tional issue.1276 Abstention is not proper, however, where the rel-

Estate Ass’n v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100 (1981), with id. at 119–25 (Justice Brennan
concurring, joined by three other Justices).

Recent decisions emphasize comity as the primary reason for restraint in federal
court actions tending to interfere with state courts. E.g., O’Shea v. Littleton, 414
U.S. 488, 499–504 (1974); Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 599–603 (1975);
Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977); Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 430
(1979). The Court has also cited comity as a reason to restrict access to federal ha-
beas corpus. Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 541 and n.31 (1976); Wainwright
v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 83, 88, 90 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 128–29 (1982).
See also Rosewell v. LaSalle National Bank, 450 U.S. 503 (1981); Fair Assessment
in Real Estate Ass’n v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100 (1981) (comity limits federal court
interference with state tax systems); Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. ___,
No. 09–223, slip op. (2010) (comity has particular force in cases challenging consti-
tutionality of state taxation of commercial activities). And see Missouri v. Jenkins,
495 U.S. 33 (1990).
     1276 C. WRIGHT, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 13 (4th ed. 1983). The

basic doctrine was formulated by Justice Frankfurter for the Court in Railroad Comm’n
v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Other strands of the doctrine are that a federal
court should refrain from exercising jurisdiction in order to avoid needless conflict
with a state’s administration of its own affairs, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315
(1943); Alabama Public Service Comm’n v. Southern Ry., 341 U.S. 341 (1951); Great
Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293 (1943); Martin v. Creasy, 360
U.S. 219 (1959); Moses H. Cone Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1 (1983);
New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, 491 U.S.
350 (1989) (carefully reviewing the scope of the doctrine), especially where state law
