quiry,” 471 and that he, along with every other person attempting to
invoke the aid of a federal court, must show “injury in fact” as a
predicate to standing. What that injury in fact may consist of, how-
ever, is the basis of the controversy.
     A suit by Members for an injunction against continued prosecu-
tion of the Indochina war was held maintainable on the theory that
if the court found the President’s actions to be beyond his constitu-
tional authority, the holding would have a distinct and significant
bearing upon the Members’ duties to vote appropriations and other
supportive legislation and to consider impeachment.472 The breadth
of this rationale was disapproved in subsequent cases. The leading
decision, issued by the D.C. Circuit, is Kennedy v. Sampson,473 in
which a Member was held to have standing to contest the alleged
improper use of a pocket veto to prevent from becoming law a bill
the Senator had voted for. Thus, Congressmen were held to have a
derivative rather than direct interest in protecting their votes, which
was sufficient for standing purposes, when some “legislative disen-
franchisement” occurred.474
    In a comprehensive assessment of its position, the Circuit dis-
tinguished between (1) a diminution in congressional influence re-
sulting from executive action that nullifies a specific congressional
vote or opportunity to vote in an objectively verifiable manner, which
will constitute injury in fact, and (2) a diminution in a legislator’s
effectiveness, subjectively judged by him, resulting from executive
action, such a failing to obey a statute, where the plaintiff legisla-
tor has power to act through the legislative process, in which in-
jury in fact does not exist.475 Having thus established a fairly broad

     473 511 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1974). In Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21 (D.C. Cir. 1985),

the court again found standing by Members challenging a pocket veto, but the Su-
preme Court dismissed the appeal as moot. Sub nom. Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S.
361 (1987). Whether the injury was the nullification of the past vote on passage
only or whether it was also the nullification of an opportunity to vote to override
the veto has divided the Circuit, with the majority favoring the broader interpreta-
tion. Goldwater v. Carter, 617 F.2d 697, 702 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and id. at 711–12

(1979)
     474 Kennedy v. Sampson, 511 F.2d 430, 435–436 (D.C. Cir. 1974). See Har-

rington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 199 n.41 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Harrington found no stand-
ing in a Member’s suit challenging CIA failure to report certain actions to Congress,
in order that Members could intelligently vote on certain issues. See also Reuss v.
Balles, 584 F.2d 461 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 997 (1978).
     475 Goldwater v. Carter, 617 F.2d 697, 702, 703 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (en banc), va-

of the Justices to remark on standing is somewhat puzzling, since it has been stated
that courts “turn initially, although not invariably, to the question of standing to
