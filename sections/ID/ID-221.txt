judicial power” and “whether the Congress may substitute for con-
stitutional courts, in which the judicial power of the United States
is vested, an administrative agency . . . for the final determination
of the existence of the facts upon which the enforcement of the con-
stitutional rights of the citizen depend.” The answer was stated broadly.
“In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power
of the United States necessarily extends to the independent deter-
mination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the per-
formance of that supreme function. . . . We think that the essen-
tial independence of the exercise of the judicial power of the United
States in the enforcement of constitutional rights requires that the
Federal court should determine such an issue upon its own record
and the facts elicited before it.” 1228
    It is not at all clear that, in this respect, Crowell v. Benson re-
mains good law. It has never been overruled, and it has been cited
by several Justices approvingly,1229 but the Court has never ap-
plied the principle to control another case.1230
    Express Constitutional Restrictions on Congress.—“[T]he Con-
stitution is filled with provisions that grant Congress or the States
specific power to legislate in certain areas; these granted powers
are always subject to the limitations that they may not be exer-
cised in a way that violates other specific provisions of the Consti-
tution.” 1231 The Supreme Court has had no occasion to deal with
this principle in the context of Congress’s power over its jurisdic-
tion and the jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts, but the pas-
sage of the Portal-to-Portal Act 1232 presented the lower courts such
an opportunity. The Act extinguished back-pay claims growing out
    1228  285 U.S. at 56, 60, 64.
    1229  See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50
(1982) (plurality opinion), and id. at 100–03, 109–11 (Justice White dissenting) (dis-
cussing the due process/Article III basis of Crowell). Both the plurality and the dis-
sent agreed that later cases had “undermined” the constitutional/jurisdictional fact
analysis. Id. at 82, n.34; 110 n.12. For other discussions, see Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378
U.S. 184, 190 (1964) (Justice Brennan announcing judgment of the Court, joined by
Justice Goldberg); Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 578–79 (1968); Agosto
v. INS, 436 U.S. 748, 753 (1978); United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 682–84
(1980), and id. at 707–12 (Justice Marshall dissenting).

Cordillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 330 U.S. 469 (1947); South Chicago Coal & Dock
Co. v. Bassett, 309 U.S. 251 (1940). Justice Frankfurter was extremely critical of
Crowell. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 142 (1946); City of Yonkers v. United
States, 320 U.S. 685 (1944).
     1231 Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 29 (1968). The elder Justice Harlan per-

haps had the same thought in mind when he said that, with regard to Congress’s
power over jurisdiction, “What such exceptions and regulations should be it is for
Congress, in its wisdom, to establish, having of course due regard to all the provi-
sions of the Constitution.” United States v. Bitty, 208 U.S. 393, 399–400 (1908).
