disagreement to the strongest point and perhaps precipitated the
overruling of Swift v. Tyson in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins.1099
    “It is impossible to overstate the importance of the Erie deci-
sion. It announces no technical doctrine of procedure or jurisdic-
tion, but goes to the heart of the relations between the Federal Gov-
ernment and the states, and returns to the states a power that had
for nearly a century been exercised by the federal government.” 1100
Erie was remarkable in a number of ways aside from the doctrine
it announced. It reversed a 96-year-old precedent, which counsel had
specifically not questioned; it reached a constitutional decision when
a statutory interpretation was available though perhaps less desir-
able; and it marked the only time in United States constitutional
history when the Court has held that it had undertaken an uncon-
stitutional action.1101
    Tompkins was injured by defendant’s train while he was walk-
ing along the tracks. He was a citizen of Pennsylvania, and the rail-
road was incorporated in New York. Had he sued in a Pennsylva-
nia court, state decisional law was to the effect that, because he
was a trespasser, the defendant owned him only a duty not to in-
jure him through wanton or willful misconduct; 1102 the general fed-
eral law treated him as a licensee who could recover for negli-
gence. Tompkins sued and recovered in federal court in New York
and the railroad presented the issue to the Supreme Court as one
covered by “local” law within the meaning of Swift v. Tyson. Jus-
tice Brandeis for himself and four other Justices, however, chose to
overrule the early case.
    First, it was argued that Tyson had failed to bring about unifor-
mity of decision and that its application discriminated against citi-
zens of a state by noncitizens. Justice Brandeis cited recent re-
searches 1103 indicating that § 34 of the 1789 Act included court
decisions in the phrase “laws of the several States.” “If only a ques-

waiting for an opportunity to give Swift v. Tyson the happy dispatch he thought it
deserved.” H. FRIENDLY, BENCHMARKS 20 (1967).
