enumerated cases and controversies in Article III. The case and the
principle have been cited and reaffirmed numerous times,1195 includ-

    Congressional Control Over Writs and Processes.—The Ju-
diciary Act of 1789 contained numerous provisions relating to the
times and places for holding court, even of the Supreme Court, to
times of adjournment, appointment of officers, issuance of writs, ci-
tations for contempt, and many other matters which it might be
supposed courts had some authority of their own to regulate.1197 The
power to enjoin governmental and private action has frequently been
curbed by Congress, especially as the action has involved the power
of taxation at either the federal or state level.1198 Though the courts
have variously interpreted these restrictions,1199 they have not de-
nied the power to impose them.
    Reacting to judicial abuse of injunctions in labor disputes,1200
Congress in 1932 enacted the Norris-La Guardia Act which forbade
the issuance of injunctions in labor disputes except through compli-

     1196 By the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress required covered states that wished

to be relieved of coverage to bring actions to this effect in the District Court of the
District of Columbia. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 331 (1966),
Chief Justice Warren for the Court said: “Despite South Carolina’s argument to the
contrary, Congress might appropriately limit litigation under this provision to a single
court in the District of Columbia, pursuant to its constitutional power under Art.
III, § 1, to ‘ordain and establish’ inferior federal tribunals.” See also Palmore v. United
States, 411 U.S. 389, 400–02 (1973); Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372 (1977); Taylor
v. St. Vincent’s Hosp., 369 F. Supp. 948 (D. Mont. 1973), aff’d, 523 F.2d 75 (9th Cir.),
