ing Comm’n,461 the Court promulgated elaborate standards, hold-
ing that an organization or association “has standing to bring suit
on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise

protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither
the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participa-
tion of individual members in the lawsuit.” Similar considerations
arise in the context of class actions, in which the Court holds that
a named representative with a justiciable claim for relief is neces-
sary when the action is filed, but that afterwards there need be only
a live controversy with the class, provided the adequacy of the rep-
