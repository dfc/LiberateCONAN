tificate of opinion and in no sense a judicial judgment. Congress
could not therefore authorize appeals to the Supreme Court in a
case where its judicial power could not be exercised, where its judg-
ment would not be final and conclusive upon the parties, and where
processes of execution were not awarded to carry it into effect. Taney
then enunciated a rule that was rigorously applied until 1933: the
award of execution is an essential part of every judgment passed
by a court exercising judicial powers and no decision is a legal judg-
ment without an award of execution.162 The rule was most signifi-
cant in barring the lower federal courts from hearing proceedings
for declaratory judgments 163 and in denying appellate jurisdiction
in the Supreme Court from declaratory proceedings in state courts.164
But, in 1927, the Court began backing away from its absolute insis-
tence upon an award of execution. Unanimously holding that a de-
claratory judgment in a state court was res judicata in a subse-
quent proceeding in federal court, the Court admitted that, “[w]hile
ordinarily a case or judicial controversy results in a judgment re-
quiring award of process of execution to carry it into effect, such
relief is not an indispensable adjunct to the exercise of the judicial
function.” 165 Then, in 1933, the Court interred the award-of-
execution rule in its rigid form and accepted an appeal from a state
court in a declaratory proceeding.166 Finality of judgment, however,
remains the rule in determining what is judicial power, without re-
gard to the demise of Chief Justice Taney’s formulation.


     162 Gordon v. United States, 117 U.S. 697 (1865) (published 1885). Subsequent

cases accepted the doctrine that an award of execution as distinguished from final-
ity of judgment was an essential attribute of judicial power. See In re Sanborn, 148
U.S. 122, 226 (1893); ICC v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 483 (1894); La Abra Silver Min-
ing Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 423, 457 (1899); Frasch v. Moore, 211 U.S. 1 (1908);
Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 355, 361–362 (1911); Postum Cereal Co. v.
California Fig Nut Co., 272 U.S. 693 (1927).
     163 Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, 273 U.S. 70 (1927).
     164 Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Growers’ Coop. Marketing Ass’n, 276 U.S.

71 (1928).
     165 Fidelity Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, 274 U.S. 123, 132 (1927).
     166 Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, 288 U.S. 249 (1933). The decisions in

Swope and Wallace removed all constitutional doubts previously shrouding a pro-
posed federal declaratory judgment act, which was enacted in 1934, 48 Stat. 955, 28
U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, and unanimously sustained in Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,
300 U.S. 227 (1937). Wallace and Haworth were cited with approval in Medimmune,
Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 126 (2007) (“Article III’s limitation of federal
courts’ jurisdiction to ‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies,’ reflected in the ‘actual controversy’
requirement of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), [does not] re-
quire[ ] a patent licensee to terminate or be in breach of its license agreement be-
fore it can seek a declaratory judgment that the underlying patent is invalid, unen-
forceable, or not infringed,” id. at 120–21).
