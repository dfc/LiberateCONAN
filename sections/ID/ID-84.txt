rules as prudential ones,439 only one of which has been a signifi-
cant factor in the jurisprudence of standing. The first two rules are
that the plaintiff ’s interest, to which she asserts an injury, must
come within the “zone of interest” arguably protected by the consti-
tutional provision or statute in question 440 and that plaintiffs may
not air “generalized grievances” shared by all or a large class of
citizens.441 The important rule concerns the ability of a plaintiff to
represent the constitutional rights of third parties not before the
court.
    Standing to Assert the Rights of Others.—Usually, one may
assert only one’s interest in the litigation and not challenge the con-
stitutionality of a statute or a governmental action because it in-
fringes the protectable rights of someone else.442 In Tileston v. Ull-
man,443 an early round in the attack on a state anti-contraceptive
law, a doctor sued, charging that he was prevented from giving his
patients needed birth control advice. The Court held that he had
no standing; no right of his was infringed, and he could not repre-
sent the interests of his patients. There are several exceptions to
the general rule, however, that make generalization misleading.

(1976). For a good example of the congressionally created interest and the injury to
it, see Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373–75 (1982) (Fair Housing
Act created right to truthful information on availability of housing; black tester’s
right injured through false information, but white tester not injured because he re-
ceived truthful information). It is clear, however, that the Court will impose separation-
of-powers restraints on the power of Congress to create interests to which injury
would give standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 571–78 (1992).
Justice Scalia, who wrote the opinion in Lujan, reiterated the separation-of-powers
objection to congressional conferral of standing in FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 29, 36
(1998) (alleged infringement of President’s “take care” obligation), but this time in
dissent; the Court did not advert to this objection in finding that Congress had pro-
vided for standing based on denial of information to which the plaintiffs, as voters,
were entitled.

Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 80 (1978); Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). In United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 687–88 (1973),
a congressional conferral case, the Court agreed that the interest asserted was one
shared by all, but the Court has disparaged SCRAP, asserting that it “surely went
to the very outer limit of the law,” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 159 (1990).
     442 United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21–23 (1960); Yazoo & M.V.R.R. v. Jack-

475 U.S. 534 (1986).

lenged law did not adversely affect plaintiffs and did not adversely affect a relation-
ship between them and persons they sought to represent).
