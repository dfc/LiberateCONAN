right or privilege, or claim or protection, or defense of the party, in
whole or in part, by whom they are asserted. . . .”
    “The constitutional right of Congress to authorize the removal
before trial of civil cases arising under the laws of the United States
has long since passed beyond doubt. It was exercised almost con-
temporaneously with the adoption of the Constitution, and the power
has been in constant use ever since. The Judiciary Act of Septem-
ber 24, 1789, was passed by the first Congress, many members of
which had assisted in framing the Constitution; and though some
doubts were soon after suggested whether cases could be removed
from state courts before trial, those doubts soon disappeared.” 783
The Court has broadly construed the modern version of the re-
moval statute at issue in this case so that it covers all cases where
federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of their duty
to enforce federal law.784 Other removal statutes, notably the civil
rights removal statute, have not been so broadly interpreted.785
    Corporations Chartered by Congress.—In Osborn v. Bank of
the United States,786 Chief Justice Marshall seized upon the autho-
rization for the Bank to sue and be sued as a grant by Congress to
the federal courts of jurisdiction in all cases to which the bank was
a party.787 Consequently, upon enactment of the 1875 law, the door
was open to other federally chartered corporations to seek relief in
federal courts. This opportunity was made actual when the Court
in the Pacific R.R. Removal Cases 788 held that tort actions against
railroads with federal charters could be removed to federal courts
solely on the basis of federal incorporation. In a series of acts, Con-
gress deprived national banks of the right to sue in federal court

    783  100 U.S. at 264–65.
    784  Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U.S. 402 (1969). See also Maryland v. Soper, 270
U.S. 9 (1926). Removal by a federal officer must be predicated on the allegation of a
colorable federal defense. Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121 (1989). However, a fed-
eral agency is not permitted to remove under the statute’s plain meaning. Interna-
tional Primate Protection League v. Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72 (1991).
     785 Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966); City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384

U.S. 808 (1966); Johnson v. Mississippi, 421 U.S. 213 (1975).
     786 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738 (1824).
     787 The First Bank could not sue because it was not so authorized. Bank of the

United States v. Deveaux, 9 U.S. (5 Cr.) 61 (1809). The language, which Marshall
interpreted as conveying jurisdiction, was long construed simply to give a party the
right to sue and be sued without itself creating jurisdiction, Bankers Trust Co. v.
Texas & P. Ry., 241 U.S. 295 (1916), but, in American National Red Cross v. S. G.,
505 U.S. 247 (1992), a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that, when a federal statutory
charter expressly mentions the federal courts in its “sue and be sued” provision, the
charter creates original federal-question jurisdiction as well, although a general au-
thorization to sue and be sued in courts of general jurisdiction, including federal
courts, without expressly mentioning them, does not confer jurisdiction.
