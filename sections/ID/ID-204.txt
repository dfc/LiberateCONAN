Controversies Between Citizens of the Same State Claiming
 Land Under Grants of Different States
    The genesis of this clause was in the report of the Committee
of Detail which vested the power to resolve such land disputes in
the Senate,1131 but this proposal was defeated in the Conven-
tion,1132 which then added this clause to the jurisdiction of the fed-
eral judiciary without reported debate.1133 The motivation for this
clause was the existence of boundary disputes affecting ten sates
at the time the Convention met. With the adoption of the North-
west Ordinance of 1787, the ultimate settlement of the boundary
disputes, and the passing of land grants by the states, this clause,
never productive of many cases, became obsolete.1134

Controversies Between a State, or the Citizens Thereof,
 and Foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects
    The scope of this jurisdiction has been limited both by judicial
decisions and the Eleventh Amendment. By judicial application of
the law of nations, a foreign state is immune from suit in the fed-
eral courts without its consent,1135 an immunity which extends to
suits brought by states of the American Union.1136 Conversely, the
Eleventh Amendment has been construed to bar suits by foreign
states against a state of the United States.1137 Consequently, the
jurisdiction conferred by this clause comprehends only suits brought
by a state against citizens or subjects of foreign states, by foreign
states against American citizens, citizens of a state against the citi-
zens or subjects of a foreign state, and by aliens against citizens of
a state.1138

     1138 But, in the absence of a federal question, there is no basis for jurisdiction

between the subjects of a foreign state. Romero v. International Terminal Operating
Co., 358 U.S. 354 (1959). The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, Pub. L.
94–538, 90 Stat. 2891, amending various sections of title 28 U.S.C., comprehen-
sively provided jurisdictional bases for suits by and against foreign states and ap-
pears as well to comprehend suits by an alien against a foreign state which would
be beyond the constitutional grant. However, in the only case in which that matter
has been an issue before it, the Court has construed the Act as creating a species of
federal question jurisdiction. Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S.
