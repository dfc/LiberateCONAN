of government. In Chief Justice Marshall’s words, “our complex sys-
tem [presents] the rare and difficult scheme of one general govern-
ment, whose actions extend over the whole, but which possesses only
certain enumerated powers, and of numerous state governments,
which retain and exercise all powers not delegated to the Union. . . .”
Naturally, in such a system, “contests respecting power must arise.” 1236
Contests respecting power may frequently arise in a federal system
with dual structures of courts exercising concurrent jurisdiction in
a number of classes of cases. Too, the possibilities of frictions grow
out of the facts that one set of courts may interfere directly or indi-
rectly with the other through injunctive and declaratory processes,
through the use of habeas corpus and removal to release persons
from the custody of the other set, and through the refusal by state
courts to be bound by decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
The relations between federal and state courts are governed in part
by constitutional law, with respect, say, to state court interference
with federal courts and state court refusal to comply with the judg-
ments of federal tribunals; in part by statutes, with respect to the
federal law generally enjoining federal court interference with pend-
ing state court proceedings; and in part by self-imposed rules of co-
mity and restraint, such as the abstention doctrine, all applied to
avoid unseemly conflicts, which, however, have at times occurred.
    Subject to congressional provision to the contrary, state courts
have concurrent jurisdiction over all the classes of cases and contro-
versies enumerated in Article III, except suits between states, those
to which the United States is a party, those to which a foreign state
is a party, and those within the traditional admiralty jurisdic-
tion.1237 Even within this last category, however, state courts, though
unable to prejudice the harmonious operation and uniformity of gen-
eral maritime law,1238 have concurrent jurisdiction over cases that
occur within the maritime jurisdiction when such litigation as-

    1236  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 204–05 (1824).
    1237  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1251, 1331 et seq. Indeed, the presumption is that state
courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction, and Congress must explicitly or implicitly con-
fine jurisdiction to the federal courts to oust the state courts. See Gulf Offshore Co.
v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 477–84 (1981); Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455 (1990);
Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Donnelly, 494 U.S. 820 (1990). Federal courts have
exclusive jurisdiction of the federal antitrust laws, even though Congress has not
spoken expressly or impliedly. See General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michi-
gan Southern Ry., 260 U.S. 261, 287 (1922). Justice Scalia has argued that, inas-
much as state courts have jurisdiction generally because federal law is law for them,
Congress can provide exclusive federal jurisdiction only by explicit and affirmative
statement in the text of the statute, Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. at 469, but as can be
seen that is not now the rule.
