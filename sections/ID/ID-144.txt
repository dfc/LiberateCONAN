    Many suits will present federal questions because a federal law
creates the action.769 Perhaps Justice Cardozo presented the most
understandable line of definition, while cautioning that “[t]o define
broadly and in the abstract ‘a case arising under the Constitution
or laws of the United States’ has hazards [approaching futility].” 770
How and when a case arises ‘under the Constitution or laws of the
United States’ has been much considered in the books. Some tests
are well established. To bring a case within the statute, a right or
immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States
must be an element, and an essential one, of the plaintiff ’s cause
of action. . . . The right or immunity must be such that it will be
supported if the Constitution or laws of the United States are given
one construction or effect, and defeated if they receive another. . . .
A genuine and present controversy, not merely a possible or conjec-
tural one, must exist with reference thereto. . . . 771
    It was long evident, though the courts were not very specific
about it, that the federal question jurisdictional statute is and al-
ways was narrower than the constitutional “arising under” jurisdic-
tional standard.772 Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn was interpret-
ing the Article III language to its utmost extent, but the courts
sometimes construed the statute equivalently, with doubtful re-
sults.773
    Removal From State Court to Federal Court.—A limited right
to “remove” certain cases from state courts to federal courts was
granted to defendants in the Judiciary Act of 1789,774 and from then
to 1872 Congress enacted several specific removal statutes, most of
them prompted by instances of state resistance to the enforcement
of federal laws through harassment of federal officers.775 The 1875
Act conferring general federal question jurisdiction on the federal
