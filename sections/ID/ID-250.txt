cence or actual impairment of a guilty verdict can be shown.1385 The
concept of “cause” excusing failure to observe a state rule is ex-
tremely narrow; “the existence of cause for procedural default must
ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objec-
tive factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to com-
ply with the State’s procedural rule.” 1386 As for the “prejudice” fac-
tor, it is an undeveloped concept, but the Court’s only case establishes
a high barrier.1387
    The Court continues, with some modest exceptions, to construe
habeas jurisdiction quite restrictively, but it has now been joined
by new congressional legislation that is also restrictive. In Herrera
v. Collins,1388 the Court appeared, though ambiguously, to take the
position that, although it requires a showing of actual innocence to
permit a claimant to bring a successive or abusive petition, a claim
of innocence is not alone sufficient to enable a claimant to obtain
review of his conviction on habeas. Petitioners are entitled in fed-
eral habeas courts to show that they are imprisoned in violation of
the Constitution, not to seek to correct errors of fact. But a claim
of innocence does not bear on the constitutionality of one’s convic-
tion or detention, and the execution of a person claiming actual in-
nocence would not, by this reasoning, violate the Constitution.1389
In a subsequent part of the opinion, however, the Court assumed
for the sake of argument that “a truly persuasive demonstration of
‘actual innocence’ made after trial would render the execution of a
defendant unconstitutional,” and it imposed a high standard for mak-

     1385 E.g., Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 538–39 (1986); Murray v. Carrier, 477

U.S. 478, 496 (1986). In Bousley v. Brooks, 523 U.S. 614 (1998), a federal post-
conviction relief case, petitioner had pled guilty to a federal firearms offense. Subse-
quently, the Supreme Court interpreted more narrowly the elements of the offense
than had the trial court in Bousley’s case. The Court held that Bousley by his plea
had defaulted, but that he might be able to demonstrate “actual innocence” so as to
excuse the default if he could show on remand that it was more likely than not that
no reasonable juror would have convicted him of the offense, properly defined.
     1386 Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. at 488. This case held that ineffective assis-

tance of counsel is not “cause” unless it rises to the level of a Sixth Amendment
violation. See also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 752–57 (1991) (because peti-
tioner had no right to counsel in state postconviction proceeding where error oc-
curred, he could not claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel). The ac-
tual novelty of a constitutional claim at the time of the state court proceeding is
“cause” excusing the petitioner’s failure to raise it then, Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1
(1984), although the failure of counsel to anticipate a line of constitutional argu-
ment then foreshadowed in Supreme Court precedent is insufficient “cause.” Engle
v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107 (1982).
     1387 United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 169 (1982) (under federal rules) (with

respect to erroneous jury instruction, inquiring whether the error “so infected the
entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process”).
