cludes the seizure and forfeiture of vessels engaged in activities in

     Admiralty Proceedings.—Procedure in admiralty jurisdiction
differs in few respects from procedure in actions at law, but the dif-
ferences that do exist are significant.893 Suits in admiralty tradition-
ally took the form of a proceeding in rem against the vessel, and,
with exceptions to be noted, such proceedings in rem are confined
exclusively to federal admiralty courts, because the grant of exclu-
sive jurisdiction to the federal courts by the Judiciary Act of 1789
has been interpreted as referring to the traditional admiralty ac-
tion, the in rem action, which was unknown to the common law.894
The savings clause in that Act under which a state court may en-
tertain actions by suitors seeking a common-law remedy preserves
to the state tribunals the right to hear actions at law where a common-
law remedy or a new remedy analogous to a common-law remedy
exists.895 Concurrent jurisdiction thus exists for the adjudication of
in personam maritime causes of action against the owner of the ves-
sel, and a plaintiff may ordinarily choose whether to bring his ac-
tion in a state court or a federal court.
    Forfeiture to the crown for violation of the laws of the sover-
eign was in English law an exception to the rule that admiralty
has exclusive jurisdiction over in rem maritime actions and was thus
considered a common-law remedy. Although the Supreme Court some-
times has used language that would confine all proceedings in rem

(4 Wall.) 555 (1867). But see Taylor v. Carryl, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 583 (1858). In Madruga
v. Superior Court, 346 U.S. 556 (1954), the jurisdiction of a state court over a parti-
tion suit at the instance of the majority shipowners was upheld on the ground that
the cause of action affected only the interest of the defendant minority shipowners
and therefore was in personam. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent argued: “If this is not
an action against the thing, in the sense which that has meaning in the law, then
the concepts of a res and an in rem proceeding have an esoteric meaning that I do
not understand.” Id. at 564.
     895 After conferring “exclusive” jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime cases on

the federal courts, § 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 77, added “saving to suit-
ors, in all cases the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is com-
petent to give it. . . .” Fixing the concurrent federal-state line has frequently been a
source of conflict within the Court. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205 (1917).
