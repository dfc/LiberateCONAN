creteness, ripeness, and the like.528 Nonetheless, even at such times,
several noteworthy constitutional decisions were rendered in declara-
tory judgment actions.529
     As part of the 1960s hospitality to greater access to courts, the
Court exhibited a greater receptivity to declaratory judgments in
constitutional litigation, especially cases involving civil liberties is-
sues.530 The doctrinal underpinnings of this hospitality were sketched
out by Justice Brennan in his opinion for the Court in Zwickler v.
Koota,531 in which the relevance to declaratory judgments of the
Dombrowski v. Pfister 532 line of cases involving federal injunctive
relief against the enforcement of state criminal statutes was in is-
sue. First, it was held that the vesting of “federal question” jurisdic-
tion in the federal courts by Congress following the Civil War, as
well as the enactment of more specific civil rights jurisdictional stat-
utes, “imposed the duty upon all levels of the federal judiciary to
give due respect to a suitor’s choice of a federal forum for the hear-
ing and decision of his federal constitutional claims.” 533 Escape from
that duty might be found only in “narrow circumstances,” such as
an appropriate application of the abstention doctrine, which was not
proper where a statute affecting civil liberties was so broad as to
reach protected activities as well as unprotected activities.
     Second, the judicially developed doctrine that a litigant must
show “special circumstances” to justify the issuance of a federal in-
junction against the enforcement of state criminal laws is not appli-
cable to requests for federal declaratory relief: “a federal district
court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of
the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the pro-
priety of the issuance of the injunction.” 534 This language was quali-
fied subsequently, so that declaratory and injunctive relief were equated
in cases in which a criminal prosecution is pending in state court
at the time the federal action is filed 535 or is begun in state court

    535 Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66 (1971). The case and its companion, Younger

v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), substantially undercut much of the Dombrowski lan-
guage and much of Zwickler was downgraded.
