status.” But, in South Carolina v. Katzenbach,1049 while holding that
the state lacked standing under Massachusetts v. Mellon to attack
the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 1050 under the
Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and under the Bill of Attain-
der Clause of Article I,1051 the Court decided on the merits the state’s
claim that Congress had exceeded its powers under the Fifteenth
Amendment.1052 Was the Court here sub silentio permitting it to
assert its interest in the execution of its own laws, rather than those
enacted by Congress, or its interest in having Congress enact only
constitutional laws for application to its citizens, an assertion that
is contrary to a number of supposedly venerated cases? 1053 Either
possibility would be significant in a number of respects.1054

Controversies Between Citizens of Different States
   The records of the Federal Convention are silent on why the
Framers included controversies between citizens of different states
among the judicial power of the United States,1055 but Congress has
     1049 383 U.S. 301 (1966). The state sued the Attorney General of the United States

as a citizen of New Jersey, thus creating the requisite jurisdiction, and avoiding the
problem that the States may not sue the United States without its consent. Minne-
sota v. Hitchcock, 185 U.S. 373 (1902); Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U.S. 60 (1906); Kan-
sas v. United States, 204 U.S. 331 (1907). The expedient is, of course, the same de-
vice as is used to avoid the Eleventh Amendment prohibition against suing a state
by suing its officers. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).
     1050 79 Stat. 437 (1965), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973 et seq.
     1051 The Court first held that neither of these provisions were restraints on what

the Federal Government might do with regard to a state. It then added: “Nor does a
State have standing as the parent of its citizens to invoke these constitutional pro-
visions against the Federal Government, the ultimate parents patriae of every Ameri-
can citizen.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 324 (1966).
     1052 The Court did not indicate on what basis South Carolina could raise the

issue. At the beginning of its opinion, the Court noted that “[o]riginal jurisdiction is
founded on the presence of a controversy between a State and a citizen of another
State under Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution. See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.,
324 U.S. 439.” 383 U.S. at 307. But surely this did not refer to that case’s parens
patriae holding.
     1053 See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923); Florida v. Mellon, 273

U.S. 12 (1927); Jones ex rel. Louisiana v. Bowles, 322 U.S. 707 (1944). See especially
Georgia v. Stanton, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 50 (1867); Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4
Wall.) 475 (1867). In Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), four original actions
were consolidated and decided. Two were actions by the United States against States,
but the other two were suits by States against the Attorney General, as a citizen of
New York, seeking to have the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 voided as
unconstitutional. South Carolina v. Katzenbach was uniformly relied on by all par-
ties as decisive of the jurisdictional question, and in announcing the judgment of
the Court Justice Black simply noted that no one raised jurisdictional or justiciabil-
ity questions. Id. at 117 n.1. See also id. at 152 n.1 (Justice Harlan concurring in
part and dissenting in part); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505 (1988); South
Carolina v. Regan, 465 U.S. 367 (1984).
