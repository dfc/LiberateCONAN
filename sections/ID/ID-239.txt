with considerable support from the other Justices,1332 went on to
affirm that, where a criminal proceeding is already pending in a
state court, if it is a single prosecution about which there is no al-
legation that it was brought in bad faith or that it was one of a
series of repeated prosecutions that would be brought, and if the
defendant may put in issue his federal-constitutional defense at the
trial, then federal injunctive relief is improper, even if it is alleged
that the statute on which the prosecution was based regulated ex-
pression and was overbroad.
    Many statutes regulating expression were valid and some over-
broad statutes could be validly applied, so findings of facial uncon-
stitutionality abstracted from concrete factual situations was not a
sound judicial method. “It is sufficient for purposes of the present
case to hold, as we do, that the possible unconstitutionality of a
statute ‘on its face’ does not in itself justify an injunction against
good-faith attempts to enforce it, and that appellee Harris has failed
to make any showing of bad faith, harassment, or any other un-
usual circumstance that would call for equitable relief.” 1333
   The reason for the principle, said Justice Black, flows from “Our
Federalism,” which requires federal courts to defer to state courts
when there are proceedings pending in them.1334
    Moreover, in a companion case, the Court held that, when pros-
ecutions are pending in state court, the propriety of injunctive and
declaratory relief should ordinarily be judged by the same stan-
dards.1335 A declaratory judgment is as likely to interfere with state
proceedings as an injunction, whether the federal decision be treated
as res judicata or viewed as a strong precedent guiding the state
court. Additionally, “the Declaratory Judgment Act provides that af-
ter a declaratory judgment is issued the district court may enforce
it by granting ‘[f]urther necessary or proper relief,’ 28 U.S.C. § 2202,
and therefore a declaratory judgment issued while state proceed-
ings are pending might serve as the basis for a subsequent injunc-
tion against those proceedings to ‘protect or effectuate’ the declara-

     1332 Only Justice Douglas dissented. 401 U.S. at 58. Justices Brennan, White,

and Marshall generally concurred in a restrained fashion. Id. at 56, 75, 93.
     1333 401 U.S. at 54. On bad faith enforcement, see id. at 56 (Justices Stewart

and Harlan concurring); 97 (Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall concurring in
part and dissenting in part). For an example, see Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance,
559 F.2d 1286, 1293–1301 (5th Cir. 1977), aff’d per curiam sub nom. Dexter v. But-
ler, 587 F.2d 176 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929 (1979).
     1334 401 U.S. at 44.
     1335 Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66 (1971). The holding was in line with Great

Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293 (1943).
