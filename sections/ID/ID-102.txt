ity, the Court held itself unable to adjudicate because the plaintiffs
were not threatened with “actual interference” with their interests.
The Justices viewed the threat to plaintiffs’ rights as hypothetical
and refused to speculate about the kinds of political activity they
might engage in or the Government’s response to it. “No threat of
interference by the Commission with rights of these appellants ap-
pears beyond that implied by the existence of the law and the regu-
lations.” 542 Similarly, resident aliens planning to work in the Terri-
tory of Alaska for the summer and then return to the United States
were denied a request for an interpretation of the immigration laws
that they would not be treated on their return as excludable aliens
entering the United States for the first time, or alternatively, for a
ruling that the laws so interpreted would be unconstitutional. The
resident aliens had not left the country and attempted to return,
although other alien workers had gone and been denied reentry, and
the immigration authorities were on record as intending to enforce
the laws as they construed them.543 Of course, the Court was not
entirely consistent in applying the doctrine.544
    It remains good general law that pre-enforcement challenges to
criminal and regulatory legislation will often be unripe for judicial
consideration because of uncertainty of enforcement,545 because the
plaintiffs can allege only a subjective feeling of inhibition or fear

     542 330 U.S. at 90. In CSC v. National Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548

(1973), without discussing ripeness, the Court decided on the merits anticipatory
attacks on the Hatch Act. Plaintiffs had, however, alleged a variety of more concrete
infringements upon their desires and intentions than the UPW plaintiffs had.

     544 In Adler v. Board of Educ., 342 U.S. 485 (1952), without discussing ripeness,

the Court decided on the merits a suit about a state law requiring dismissal of teach-
ers advocating violent overthrow of the government, over a strong dissent arguing
the case was indistinguishable from Mitchell. Id. at 504 (Justice Frankfurter dissent-
ing). In Cramp v. Board of Pub. Instruction, 368 U.S. 278 (1961), a state employee
was permitted to attack a non-Communist oath, although he alleged he believed he
could take the oath in good faith and could prevail if prosecuted, because the oath
was so vague as to subject plaintiff to the “risk of unfair prosecution and the poten-
tial deterrence of constitutionally protected conduct.” Id. at 283–84. See also Bag-
gett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589
(1967).
     545 E.g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961) (no adjudication of challenge to law

barring use of contraceptives because in 80 years of the statute’s existence the state
had never instituted a prosecution). But compare Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97
(1987) (merits reached in absence of enforcement and fair indication state would
not enforce it); Vance v. Amusement Co., 445 U.S. 308 (1980) (reaching merits, al-
though state asserted law would not be used, although local prosecutor had so threat-
ened; no discussion of ripeness, but dissent relied on Poe, id. at 317–18).
