immunity from suit on behalf of government corporations.973
     Suits Against United States Officials.—United States v. Lee,
a 5-to-4 decision, qualified earlier holdings that a judgment affect-
ing the property of the United States was in effect against the United
States, by ruling that title to the Arlington estate of the Lee fam-
ily, then being used as a national cemetery, was not legally vested
in the United States but was being held illegally by army officers
under an unlawful order of the President. In its examination of the
sources and application of the rule of sovereign immunity, the Court
concluded that the rule “if not absolutely limited to cases in which
the United States are made defendants by name, is not permitted
to interfere with the judicial enforcement of the rights of plaintiff
when the United States is not a defendant or a necessary party to
the suit.” 974 Except, nevertheless, for an occasional case like Kan-
sas v. United States,975 which held that a state cannot sue the United
States, most of the cases involving sovereign immunity from suit
since 1883 have been cases against officers, agencies, or corpora-
tions of the United States where the United States has not been
named as a party defendant. Thus, it has been held that a suit against
the Secretary of the Treasury to review his decision on the rate of
duty to be exacted on imported sugar would disturb the whole rev-
enue system of the government and would in effect be a suit against
the United States.976 Even more significant is Stanley v. Schwalby,977
holding that an action of trespass against an army officer to try
title in a parcel of land occupied by the United States as a military
reservation was a suit against the United States because a judg-
ment in favor of the plaintiffs would have been a judgment against
the United States.

be held to embrace action in the federal courts unless the language giving consent

here to be an indispensable party defendant in a condemnation proceeding brought
by a state to acquire a right of way over lands owned by the United States and held
in trust for Indian allottees. See also Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. 273 (1983).

against the United States for takings claims.
