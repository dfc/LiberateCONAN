so it has been understood since,269 with only a few judicial voices
raised to suggest that what Congress could not do directly (by sus-
pension) it could not do by omission (by failing to provide for ha-
beas).270 But, because statutory authority had always existed autho-
rizing the federal courts to grant the relief they deemed necessary
under habeas corpus, the Court did not need to face the ques-
tion.271
     Having determined in Bollman that a statute was necessary be-
fore the federal courts had power to issue writs of habeas corpus,
Chief Justice Marshall pointed to § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789
as containing the necessary authority.272 As the Chief Justice read
it, the authorization was limited to persons imprisoned under fed-
eral authority. It was not until 1867, with two small exceptions,273
that legislation specifically empowered federal courts to inquire into
the imprisonment of persons under state authority.274 Pursuant to
this authorization, the Court then expanded the use of the writ into
a major instrument to reform procedural criminal law in both fed-
eral and state jurisdictions.
    However, the question then arose as to what aspects of this broader
habeas are protected against suspension. Noting that the statutory
writ of habeas corpus has been expanded dramatically since the First
Congress, the Court has written that it “assume[s] . . . that the Sus-
pension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists

other grounds sub nom., Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950) (holding that
habeas exists as an inherent common law right); see also Justice Black’s dissent, id.
at 791, 798: “Habeas corpus, as an instrument to protect against illegal imprison-
ment, is written into the Constitution. Its use by courts cannot in my judgment be
constitutionally abridged by Executive or by Congress.” And, in Jones v. Cun-
ningham, 371 U.S. 236, 238 (1963), the Court said: “The habeas corpus jurisdic-
tional statute implements the constitutional command that the writ of habeas cor-
pus be made available.” (Emphasis added).

     274 The act of February 5, 1867, 14 Stat. 385, conveyed power to federal courts

“to grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases where any person may be restrained of
his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United
States. . . .” On the law with respect to state prisoners prior to this statute, see Ex
