voked.886 Both the Court and Congress have created exceptions to
the situs test for maritime tort jurisdiction to extend landward the
occasions for certain connected persons or events to come within
admiralty, not without a little controversy.887
    From the earliest days of the Republic, the federal courts sit-
ting in admiralty have been held to have exclusive jurisdiction of
prize cases.888 Also, in contrast to other phases of admiralty juris-
diction, prize law as applied by the British courts continued to pro-
vide the basis of American law so far as practicable,889 and so far
as it was not modified by subsequent legislation, treaties, or execu-
tive proclamations. Finally, admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in-
     886 Executive Jet Aviation v. City of Cleveland, 409 U.S. 249 (1972) (plane crash

in which plane landed wholly fortuitously in navigable waters off the airport run-
way not in admiralty jurisdiction). However, so long as there is maritime activity
and a general maritime commercial nexus, admiralty jurisdiction exists. Foremost
Ins. Co. v. Richardson, 457 U.S. 668 (1982) (collision of two pleasure boats on navi-
gable waters is within admiralty jurisdiction); Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U.S. 358 (1990)
(fire on pleasure boat docked at marina on navigable water). See also Grubart v.
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U.S. 527 (1995), a tort claim arising out of
damages allegedly caused by negligently driving piles from a barge into the river-
bed, which weakened a freight tunnel that allowed flooding of the tunnel and the
basements of numerous buildings along the Chicago River. The Court found that
admiralty jurisdiction could be invoked. The location test was satisfied, because the
barge, even though fastened to the river bottom, was a “vessel” for admiralty tort
purposes; the two-part connection test was also satisfied, inasmuch as the incident
had a potential to disrupt maritime commerce and the conduct giving rise to the
incident had a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.
     887 Thus, the courts have enforced seamen’s claims for maintenance and cure

for injuries incurred on land. O’Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U.S. 36, 41–42 (1943).
The Court has applied the doctrine of seaworthiness to permit claims by longshore-
men injured on land because of some condition of the vessel or its cargo. Gutierrez
v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 373 U.S. 206 (1963); Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S.
85 (1946); Mahnich v. Southern S.S. Co., 321 U.S. 96 (1944). But see Victory Carri-
ers v. Law, 404 U.S. 202 (1971). In the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. § 688,
Congress gave seamen, or their personal representatives, the right to seek compen-
sation from their employers for personal injuries arising out of their maritime em-
ployment. Respecting who is a seaman for Jones Act purposes, see Southwest Ma-
rine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502 U.S. 81 (1991); McDermott International, Inc. v. Wilander,
498 U.S. 337 (1991). The rights exist even if the injury occurred on land. O’Donnell
v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U.S. at 43; Swanson v. Mara Brothers, 328 U.S. 1, 4 (1946).
In the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 62 Stat. 496, 46 U.S.C. § 740, Con-
gress provided an avenue of relief for persons injured in themselves or their prop-
erty by action of a vessel on navigable water which is consummated on land, as by
the collision of a ship with a bridge. By the 1972 amendments to the Longshore-
men’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 86 Stat. 1251, amending 33 U.S.C.
§§ 901–950, Congress broadened the definition of “navigable waters” to include in
certain cases adjoining piers, wharfs, etc., and modified the definition of “employee”
to mean any worker “engaged in maritime employment” within the prescribed mean-
ings, thus extending the Act shoreward and changing the test of eligibility from “si-
tus” alone to the “situs” of the injury and the “status” of the injured.
