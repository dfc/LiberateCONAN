    JURISDICTION OF SUPREME COURT AND INFERIOR
                  FEDERAL COURTS

Cases Arising Under the Constitution, Laws, and Treaties
 of the United States
    Cases arising under the Constitution are cases that require an
interpretation of the Constitution for their correct decision.754 They
arise when a litigant claims an actual or threatened invasion of his
constitutional rights by the enforcement of some act of public au-
thority, usually an act of Congress or of a state legislature, and asks
for judicial relief. The clause furnishes the principal textual basis
for the implied power of judicial review of the constitutionality of
legislation and other official acts.
     Development of Federal Question Jurisdiction.—Almost from
the beginning, the Convention demonstrated an intent to create “fed-
eral question” jurisdiction in the federal courts with regard to fed-
eral laws; 755 such cases involving the Constitution and treaties were
added fairly late in the Convention as floor amendments.756 But when
Congress enacted the Judiciary Act of 1789, it did not confer gen-
eral federal question jurisdiction on the inferior federal courts, but
left litigants to remedies in state courts with appeals to the United
States Supreme Court if judgment went against federal constitu-
tional claims.757 Although there were a few jurisdictional provi-
sions enacted in the early years,758 it was not until the period fol-
lowing the Civil War that Congress, in order to protect newly created
federal civil rights and in the flush of nationalist sentiment, first
created federal jurisdiction in civil rights cases,759 and then in 1875
conferred general federal question jurisdiction on the lower federal
courts.760 Since that time, the trend generally has been toward con-
