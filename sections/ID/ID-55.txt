release, since a discharge from custody was the only function of the
writ,287 but this restraint too the Court has abandoned in an em-
phasis upon the statutory language directing the habeas court to
“dispose of the matter as law and justice require.” 288 Thus, even if
a prisoner has been released from jail, the presence of collateral
consequences flowing from his conviction gives the court jurisdic-
tion to determine the constitutional validity of the conviction.289
    Petitioners seeking federal habeas relief must first exhaust their
state remedies, a limitation long settled in the case law and codi-
fied in 1948.290 Prisoners are required to present their claims in
state court only once, either on appeal or collateral attack, and they
need not return time and again to raise their issues before coming
to federal court.291 In addition, “[w]hen a state court declines to re-
view the merits of a petitioner’s claim on the ground that it has
done so already, it creates no bar to federal habeas review. . . . A
claim is procedurally barred when it has not been fairly presented
to the state courts for their initial consideration—not when the claim
has been presented more than once.” 292
    Although they were once required to petition the Supreme Court
on certiorari to review directly their state convictions, prisoners have
been relieved of this largely pointless exercise,293 but, if the Su-
preme Court has taken and decided a case, then its judgment is
Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426 (2004) (federal district court in New York lacks
jurisdiction over prisoner being held in a naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina;
the commander of the brig, not the Secretary of Defense, is the immediate custo-
dian and proper respondent).
     287 McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131 (1934); Parker v. Ellis, 362 U.S. 574 (1960).
     288 28 U.S.C. § 2243. See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54 (1968). See also Maleng v.

Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).
     289 Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234 (1968), overruling Parker v. Ellis, 362 U.S.

574 (1960). In Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), the Court overruled McNally v.
Hill, 293 U.S. 131 (1934), and held that a prisoner may attack on habeas the second
of two consecutive sentences while still serving the first. See also Walker v. Wain-
wright, 390 U.S. 335 (1968) (prisoner may attack the first of two consecutive sen-
tences although the only effect of a successful attack would be immediate confine-
ment on the second sentence). Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court , 410 U.S. 484
(1973), held that one sufficiently in custody of a state could use habeas to challenge
the state’s failure to bring him to trial on pending charges.
     290 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b). See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 490–497 (1973),

and id. at 500, 512–24 (Justice Brennan dissenting); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509,
515–21 (1982). If a prisoner submits a petition with both exhausted and unexhausted
claims, the habeas court must dismiss the entire petition. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S.
at 518–519. Exhaustion first developed in cases brought by persons in state custody
prior to any judgment. Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241 (1886); Urquhart v. Brown,
205 U.S. 179 (1907).
     291 Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 447–450 (1953); id. at 502 (Justice Frank-

furter concurring); Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 350 (1989).
     292 Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–1114, slip op. at 17, 18 (2009).
     293 Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 435 (1963), overruling Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S.

200 (1950).
