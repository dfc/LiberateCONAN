to make it extremely difficult to convict one of levying war against
the United States short of the conduct of or personal participation
in actual hostilities.1424

Aid and Comfort to the Enemy
    The Cramer Case.—Since Bollman, the few treason cases that
have reached the Supreme Court were outgrowths of World War II
and have charged adherence to enemies of the United States and
the giving of aid and comfort. In the first of these, Cramer v. United
States,1425 the issue was whether the “overt act” had to be “openly
manifest treason” or if it was enough if, when supported by the proper
evidence, it showed the required treasonable intention.1426 The Court,
in a five-to-four opinion by Justice Jackson, in effect took the for-
mer view holding that “the two-witness principle” interdicted “im-
putation of incriminating acts to the accused by circumstantial evi-
dence or by the testimony of a single witness,” 1427 even though the
single witness in question was the accused himself. “Every act, move-
ment, deed, and word of the defendant charged to constitute trea-
son must be supported by the testimony of two witnesses,” 1428 Jus-
tice Jackson asserted. Justice Douglas in a dissent, in which Chief
Justice Stone and Justices Black and Reed concurred, contended that
     1424 There have been lower court cases in which convictions were obtained. As a

result of the Whiskey Rebellion, convictions of treason were obtained on the basis of
the ruling that forcible resistance to the enforcement of the revenue laws was a con-
structive levying of war. United States v. Vigol, 29 Fed. Cas. 376 (No. 16621) (C.C.D.
Pa. 1795); United States v. Mitchell, 26 Fed. Cas. 1277 (No. 15788) (C.C.D. Pa. 1795).
After conviction, the defendants were pardoned. See also for the same ruling in a
different situation the Case of Fries, 9 Fed. Cas. 826, 924 (Nos. 5126, 5127) (C.C.D.
Pa. 1799, 1800). The defendant was again pardoned after conviction. About a half
century later participation in forcible resistance to the Fugitive Slave Law was held
not to be a constructive levying of war. United States v. Hanway, 26 Fed. Cas. 105
(No. 15299) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1851). Although the United States Government regarded
the activities of the Confederate States as a levying of war, the President by Am-
nesty Proclamation of December 25, 1868, pardoned all those who had participated
on the southern side in the Civil War. In applying the Captured and Abandoned
Property Act of 1863 (12 Stat. 820) in a civil proceeding, the Court declared that the
foundation of the Confederacy was treason against the United States. Sprott v. United
States, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 459 (1875). See also Hanauer v. Doane, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.)
342 (1871); Thorington v. Smith, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 1 (1869); Young v. United States,
97 U.S. 39 (1878). These four cases bring in the concept of adhering to the enemy
and giving him aid and comfort, but these are not criminal cases and deal with at-
tempts to recover property under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act by per-
sons who claimed that they had given no aid or comfort to the enemy. These cases
are not, therefore, an interpretation of the Constitution.

     1427 325 U.S. at 35.
     1428 325 U.S. at 34–35. Earlier, Justice Jackson had declared that this phase of

treason consists of two elements: “adherence to the enemy; and rendering him aid
and comfort.” A citizen, it was said, may take actions “which do aid and comfort the
enemy . . . but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to
