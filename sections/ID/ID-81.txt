Court has insisted that there must be a “substantial likelihood” that
the relief sought from the court if granted would remedy the harm.425
These two requirements are often inter-related. Thus, low-income
persons seeking the invalidation of a town’s restrictive zoning ordi-
nance were held to lack standing, because they had failed to allege
with sufficient particularity that the complained-of injury—
inability to obtain adequate housing within their means—was fairly
attributable to the ordinance instead of to other factors, so that void-
ing of the ordinance might not have any effect upon their ability to
find affordable housing.426
    Other examples of these two elements include a holding that
poor people who had been denied service at certain hospitals lacked
standing to challenge IRS policy of extending tax benefits to hospi-
tals that did not serve indigents, because they could not show that
alteration of the tax policy would cause the hospitals to alter their
policies and treat them.427 Similarly, the link between fully inte-
grated public schools and allegedly lax administration of tax policy
permitting benefits to discriminatory private schools was deemed
too tenuous, the harm flowing from private actors not before the

a single requirement, the Court now insists they are separate inquiries. Id. at 753
n.19. To the extent there is a difference, it is that the former examines a causal
connection between the assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury, whereas
the latter examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the judi-
cial relief requested. Id. In Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S.
83 (1998), the Court denied standing because of the absence of redressability. An
environmental group sued the company for failing to file timely reports required by
statute; by the time the complaint was filed, the company was in full compliance.
Acknowledging that the entity had suffered injury in fact, the Court found that no
judicial action would afford it a remedy.

ropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 (1974), however, a person who al-
leged he was seeking housing in the community and that he would qualify if the
organizational plaintiff were not inhibited by allegedly racially discriminatory zon-
ing laws from constructing housing for low-income persons like himself was held to
have shown a “substantial probability” that voiding of the ordinance would benefit
him.

Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973) (mother of illegitimate child lacked
standing to contest prosecutorial policy of using child support laws to coerce sup-
port of legitimate children only, as it was “only speculative” that prosecution of fa-
ther would result in support rather than jailing). However, in Summers v. Earth
Island Institute, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1151 (2009), the Court noted in dicta that, if a
plaintiff is denied a procedural right, the fact that the right had been accorded by
Congress “can loosen the strictures of the redressability prong of our standing in-
quiry.” Thus, standing may exist even though a court’s enforcing a procedural right
accorded by Congress, such as the right to comment on a proposed federal agency
action, will not guarantee the plaintiff success in persuading the agency to adopt
the plaintiff ’s point of view.
