from suit without the state’s consent. Ex parte Young 1314 is a semi-
nal case in American constitutional law because it created a fiction
by which the validity of state statutes and other actions could be
challenged by suits against state officers as individuals.1315
    Conflict between federal and state courts is inevitable when the
federal courts are open to persons complaining about unconstitu-
tional or unlawful state action which could as well be brought in
the state courts and perhaps is so brought by other persons, but
the various rules of restraint flowing from the concept of comity re-
duce federal interference here some considerable degree. It is rather
in three fairly well defined areas that institutional conflict is most
pronounced.
    Federal Restraint of State Courts by Injunctions.—Even
where the federal anti-injunction law is inapplicable, or where the
question of application is not reached,1316 those seeking to enjoin
state court proceedings must overcome substantial prudential bar-
riers, among them the abstention doctrine 1317 and more important
than that the equity doctrine that suits in equity “shall not be sus-
tained in . . . the courts of the United States, in any case where
plain, adequate and complete remedy may be had at law.” 1318 The
application of this latter principle has been most pronounced in the
reluctance of federal courts to interfere with a state’s good faith en-
forcement of its criminal law. Here, the Court has required of a liti-
gant seeking to bar threatened state prosecution not only a show-
ing of irreparable injury that is both great and immediate, but also
an inability to defend his constitutional rights in the state proceed-
ing. Certain types of injury, such as the cost, anxiety, and inconve-
nience of having to defend against a single criminal prosecution,
are insufficient to be considered irreparable in this sense. Even if a
state criminal statute is unconstitutional, a person charged under
it usually has an adequate remedy at law by raising his constitu-
tional defense in the state trial.1319 The policy has never been stated

    1314  209 U.S. 123 (1908).
    1315  The fiction is that while the official is a state actor for purposes of suit against
him, the claim that his action is unconstitutional removes the imprimatur of the
state that would shield him under the Eleventh Amendment. 209 U.S. at 159–60.
     1316 28 U.S.C. § 2283 may be inapplicable because no state court proceeding is

pending or because the action is brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Its application
may never be reached because a court may decide that equitable principles do not
justify injunctive relief. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 54 (1971).
     1317 See “Abstention,” supra.
     1318 The quoted phrase setting out the general principle is from the Judiciary

Act of 1789, § 16, 1 Stat. 82.
