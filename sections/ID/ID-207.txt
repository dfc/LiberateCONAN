             THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME
                                         COURT
           From the beginning, the Supreme Court has assumed that its
       original jurisdiction flows directly from the Constitution and is there-
       fore self-executing without further action by Congress.1151 In Chisholm
       v. Georgia,1152 the Court entertained an action of assumpsit against
       Georgia by a citizen of another state. Congress in § 3 of the Judi-
       ciary Act of 1789 1153 purported to invest the Court with original
       jurisdiction in suits between a state and citizens of another state,
       but it did not authorize actions of assumpsit in such cases nor did
       it prescribe forms of process for the exercise of original jurisdiction.
       Over the dissent of Justice Iredell, the Court, in opinions by Chief
       Justice Jay and Justices Blair, Wilson, and Cushing, sustained its
       jurisdiction and its power to provide forms of process and rules of
       procedure in the absence of congressional enactments. The back-
       lash of state sovereignty sentiment resulted in the proposal and rati-
       fication of the Eleventh Amendment, which did not, however, affect
       the direct flow of original jurisdiction to the Court, although those
       cases to which states were parties were now limited to states as
       party plaintiffs, to two or more states disputing, or to United States
       suits against states.1154
           By 1861, Chief Justice Taney could confidently enunciate, after
       review of the precedents, that in all cases where original jurisdic-
       tion is given by the Constitution, the Supreme Court has authority
       “to exercise it without further act of Congress to regulate its pow-
       ers or confer jurisdiction, and that the court may regulate and mould
       the process it uses in such manner as in its judgment will best pro-
       mote the purposes of justice.” 1155
           Although Chief Justice Marshall apparently assumed the Court
       had exclusive jurisdiction of cases within its original jurisdic-
       tion,1156 Congress from 1789 on gave the inferior federal courts con-
           1151 But, in § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 80, Congress did so pur-

       port to convey the jurisdiction and the statutory conveyance exists today. 28 U.S.C.
       § 1251. It does not, however, exhaust the listing of the Constitution.

       not raised. Georgia v. Brailsford, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 402 (1792).
           1153 1 Stat. 80.
