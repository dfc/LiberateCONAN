of the general maritime law and empowered Congress to legislate
in respect of them and other matters within the admiralty and mari-
time jurisdiction. Moreover, it took from the states all power, by leg-
islation or judicial decision, to contravene the essential purposes of,
or to work material injury to, characteristic features of such law or
to interfere with its proper harmony and uniformity in its interna-
tional and interstate relations.” 917 Second, Congress reenacted the
law but excluded masters and crew members of vessels from those
who might claim compensation for maritime injuries.918
    The Court found this effort unconstitutional as well, because “the
manifest purpose [of the statute] was to permit any State to alter
the maritime law and thereby introduce conflicting require-
ments.” 919 Finally, in 1927, Congress passed the Longshoremen’s and
Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which provided accident com-
pensation for injuries, including those resulting in death, sustained
on navigable waters by employees, other than members of the crew,
whenever “recovery . . . may not validly be provided by State law.” 920
    With certain exceptions,921 the federal-state conflict since Jensen
has taken place with regard to three areas: (1) the interpretation
of federal and state bases of relief for injuries and death as af-
fected by the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation
Act; (2) the interpretation of federal and state bases of relief for
personal injuries by maritime workers as affected by the Jones Act;
and (3) the application of state law to permit recovery in maritime
wrongful death cases in which until recently there was no federal
maritime right to recover.922

     922 Jensen, though much criticized, is still the touchstone of the decisional pro-

cess in this area with its emphasis on the general maritime law. E.g., Pope & Talbot
v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406 (1953); Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,
358 U.S. 625 (1959). In Askew v. American Waterways Operators, 411 U.S. 325, 337–44
