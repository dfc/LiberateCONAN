courts and the speculative possibility that directing denial of ben-
efits would result in any minority child being admitted to a school.428
     But the Court did permit plaintiffs to attack the constitutional-
ity of a law limiting the liability of private utilities in the event of
nuclear accidents and providing for indemnification, on a showing
that “but for” the passage of the law there was a “substantial like-
lihood,” based upon industry testimony and other material in the
legislative history, that the nuclear power plants would not be con-
structed and that therefore the environmental and aesthetic harm
alleged by plaintiffs would not occur; a voiding of the law would
likely relieve the plaintiffs of the complained of injuries.429 Thus,
operation of the requirements of causation and redressability makes
difficult but not impossible the establishment of standing by per-
sons indirectly injured by governmental action, that is, action taken
as to third parties that is alleged to have injured the claimants as
a consequence.430
    In a case permitting a plaintiff contractors’ association to chal-
lenge an affirmative-action, set-aside program, the Court seemed to
depart from several restrictive standing decisions in which it had
held that the claims of attempted litigants were too “speculative”
or too “contingent.” 431 The association had sued, alleging that many
of its members “regularly bid on and perform construction work”
for the city and that they would have bid on the set-aside contracts
but for the restrictions. The Court found the association had stand-
ing, because certain prior cases under the Equal Protection Clause
established a relevant proposition. “When the government erects a
barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to
obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group, a member
of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need not al-
lege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in
     428 Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984). But see Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S.

728 (1984), where persons denied equal treatment in conferral of benefits were held
to have standing to challenge the treatment, although a judicial order could only
have terminated benefits to the favored class. In that event, members would have
secured relief in the form of equal treatment, even if they did not receive benefits.
See also Arkansas Writers’ Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987); Orr v. Orr,
440 U.S. 268, 271–273 (1979).
     429 Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 72–78

1978). The likelihood of relief in some cases appears to be rather speculative at best.
E.g., Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 366–368 (1980); Watt v. Energy Action Educa-
tional Foundation, 454 U.S. 151, 160–162 (1981).
     430 Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 505 (1975); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,

756–761 (1984).
     431 Thus, it appears that had the Court applied its standard in the current case,

the results would have been different in such cases as Linda R. S. v. Richard D.,
410 U.S. 614 (1973); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975); Simon v. Eastern Ken-
tucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26 (1976); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984).
