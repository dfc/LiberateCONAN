fer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co.,1091 it became
highly important to the plaintiff company to bring its suit in fed-
eral court rather than in a state court. Thus, Black & White, a Ken-
tucky corporation, dissolved itself and obtained a charter as a Ten-
nessee corporation; the only change made was the state of
incorporation, the name, officers, shareholders, and location of the
business remaining the same. A majority of the Court, over a strong
dissent by Justice Holmes,1092 saw no collusion and upheld diver-
sity, meaning that the company won whereas it would have lost had
it sued in the state court. Black & White Taxicab probably more
than anything led to a reexamination of the decision on the choice
of law to be applied in diversity litigation.
     The Law Applied in Diversity Cases.—By virtue of § 34 of
the Judiciary Act of 1789,1093 state law expressed in constitutional
and statutory form was regularly applied in federal courts in diver-
sity actions to govern the disposition of such cases. But, in Swift v.
Tyson,1094 Justice Story for the Court ruled that state court deci-
sions were not laws within the meaning of § 34 and though en-
titled to respect were not binding on federal judges, except with re-
gard to matters of a “local nature,” such as statutes and interpretations
thereof pertaining to real estate and other immovables, in contrast
to questions of general commercial law as to which the answers were
dependent not on “the decisions of the local tribunals, but in the
general principles and doctrines of commercial jurisprudence.” 1095

    1091   276 U.S. 518 (1928).
    1092   276 U.S. at 532 (joined by Justices Brandeis and Stone). Justice Holmes
here presented his view that Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 1 (1842), had been
wrongly decided, but he preferred not to overrule it, merely “not allow it to spread
. . . into new fields.” 276 U.S. at 535.
      1093 The section provided that “the laws of the several states, except where the

constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require or pro-
vide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of
the United States in cases where they apply.” 1 Stat. 92. With only insubstantial
changes, the section now appears as 28 U.S.C. § 1652. For a concise review of the
entire issue, see C. WRIGHT, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS ch. 9 (4th ed.
1983).
      1094 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 1 (1842). The issue in the case was whether a pre-existing

debt was good consideration for an indorsement of a bill of exchange so that the
endorsee would be a holder in due course.
      1095 41 U.S. at 19. The Justice concluded this portion of the opinion: “The law

respecting negotiable instruments may be truly declared in the language of Cicero,
adopted by Lord Mansfield in Luke v. Lyde, 2 Burr. R. 883, 887, to be in great mea-
sure, not the law of a single country only, but of the commercial world. Nun erit
alia lex Romae, alia Athenis; alia munc, alia posthac, sed et apud omnes gentes, et
omni tempore una eademque lex obtenebit.” Id. The thought that the same law should
prevail in Rome as in Athens was used by Justice Story in DeLovio v. Boit, 7 Fed.
Cas. 418, 443 (No. 3776) (C.C.D. Mass. 1815). For a modern use, see United States
v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966); 380 F.2d 385, 398
(5th Cir. 1967) (dissenting opinion).
