the members, in this respect, can be exercised in their corporate
name.” Nevertheless, the Court upheld diversity jurisdiction in the
case because the members of the bank as a corporation were citi-
zens of one state and Deveaux was a citizen of another. The hold-
ing that corporations were citizens of the states where their stock-
holders lived was reaffirmed a generation later,1079 but pressures
were building for change. While corporations were assuming an ever
more prominent economic role, the Strawbridge rule, which fore-
closed diversity suits if any plaintiff had common citizenship with
any defendant,1080 was working to close the doors of the federal courts
to corporations with stockholders in many states.
     Deveaux was overruled in 1844, when, after elaborate argu-
ment, a divided Court held that “a corporation created by and do-
ing business in a particular state, is to be deemed to all intents
and purposes as a person, although an artificial person, an inhabit-
ant of the same state, for the purposes of its incorporation, capable
of being treated as a citizen of that state, as much as a natural
person.” 1081 Ten years later, the Court abandoned this rationale, but
it achieved the same result by “indulg[ing] in the fiction that, al-
though a corporation was not itself a citizen for diversity purposes,
its shareholders would be conclusively presumed citizens of the in-
corporating State.” 1082 “State of incorporation” remained the guid-
ing rule for determining the place of corporate citizenship until Con-
gress amended the jurisdictional statute in 1958. Concern over growing
dockets and companies incorporating in states of convenience then
led to a dual citizenship rule whereby “a corporation shall be deemed
to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and
of the State where it has its principal place of business.” 1083 The

dictional citizenship in deciding that a corporation’s “principal place of business” un-
der the statute is its “nerve center,” the place where the corporation’s officers direct,
control, and coordinate the corporation’s activities.
     The jurisdictional statute additionally deems the place of an insured’s citizen-
ship as an additional place of citizenship of an insurer being sued in a direct action
case.
