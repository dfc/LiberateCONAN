are maintainable.989 Third, cases involving injury to a plaintiff be-
cause the official has exceeded his statutory authority. In general
these suits are maintainable.990 Fourth, cases in which an officer
seeks immunity behind statutory authority or some other sover-
eign command for the commission of a common law tort.991 This
category of cases presents the greatest difficulties because these suits
can as readily be classified as falling into the first group if the ac-
tion directly or indirectly is one for specific performance or if the
judgment would affect the United States.
     Suits Against Government Corporations.â€”The multiplica-
tion of government corporations during periods of war and depres-
sion has provided one motivation for limiting the doctrine of sover-
eign immunity. In Keifer & Keifer v. RFC,992 the Court held that
the government does not become a conduit of its immunity in suits
against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its
work. Nor does the creation of a government corporation confer upon
it legal immunity. Whether Congress endows a public corporation
with governmental immunity in a specific instance is a matter of
ascertaining the congressional will. Moreover, it has been held that
waivers of governmental immunity in the case of federal instrumen-
talities and corporations should be construed liberally.993 On the other
hand, Indian nations are exempt from suit without further congres-
sional authorization; it is as though their former immunity as sov-
ereigns passed to the United States for their benefit, as did their
tribal properties.994

    989 Rickert Rice Mills v. Fontenot, 297 U.S. 110 (1936); Tennessee Electric Power

Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118 (1939) (holding that one threatened with direct and special
injury by the act of an agent of the government under a statute may challenge the
constitutionality of the statute in a suit against the agent).
    990 Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605 (1912); Waite v. Macy, 246 U.S.

606 (1918).
    991 United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S. 536

(1926); Ickes v. Fox, 300 U.S. 82 (1937); Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947). See
also Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564 (1959); Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593 (1959). An
emerging variant is the constitutional tort case, which springs from Bivens v. Six
Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and which involves different stan-
dards of immunity for officers. Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478 (1978); Carlson v.
Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982).
    992 306 U.S. 381 (1939).
    993 FHA v. Burr, 309 U.S. 242 (1940). Nonetheless, the Court held that a con-

gressional waiver of immunity in the case of a governmental corporation did not
mean that funds or property of the United States can be levied on to pay a judg-
ment obtained against such a corporation as the result of waiver of immunity.
