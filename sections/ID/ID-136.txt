     At various times, the Court has followed more strictly than other
times the prudential theorems for avoidance of decisionmaking when
it deemed restraint to be more desirable than activism.724
     The Doctrine of “Strict Necessity”.—The Court has repeat-
edly declared that it will decide constitutional issues only if strict
necessity compels it to do so. Thus, constitutional questions will not
be decided in broader terms than are required by the precise state
of facts to which the ruling is to be applied, nor if the record pres-
ents some other ground upon which to decide the case, nor at the
instance of one who has availed himself of the benefit of a statute
or who fails to show he is injured by its operation, nor if a construc-
tion of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be
fairly avoided.725
     Speaking of the policy of avoiding the decision of constitutional
issues except when necessary, Justice Rutledge wrote: “The policy’s
ultimate foundations, some if not all of which also sustain the juris-
dictional limitation, lie in all that goes to make up the unique place
and character, in our scheme, of judicial review of governmental ac-
tion for constitutionality. They are found in the delicacy of that func-
tion, particularly in view of possible consequences for others stem-
ming also from constitutional roots; the comparative finality of those
consequences; the consideration due to the judgment of other reposi-
tories of constitutional power concerning the scope of their author-
ity; the necessity, if government is to function constitutionally, for
each to keep within its power, including the courts; the inherent
limitations of the judicial process, arising especially from its largely
negative character and limited resources of enforcement; withal in
the paramount importance of constitutional adjudication in our sys-
tem.” 726
     The Doctrine of Clear Mistake.—A precautionary rule early
formulated and at the base of the traditional concept of judicial re-
straint was expressed by Professor James Bradley Thayer to the
effect that a statute could be voided as unconstitutional only “when
those who have the right to make laws have not merely made a

restraint as well as considerations of comity underlie the Court’s abstention doc-
trine when the constitutionality of state laws is challenged.
