tions.393 Where expenditures “were not expressly authorized or man-
dated by any specific congressional enactment,” a lawsuit challeng-
ing them “is not directed at an exercise of congressional power and
thus lacks the requisite ‘logical nexus’ between taxpayer status ‘and
the type of legislative enactment attacked.’ ” 394
    Local taxpayers attacking local expenditures have generally been
permitted more leeway than federal taxpayers insofar as standing
is concerned. Thus, in Everson v. Board of Education,395 a munici-
pal taxpayer was found to have standing to challenge the use of
public funds for transportation of pupils to parochial schools.396 But,
in Doremus v. Board of Education,397 the Court refused an appeal
from a state court for lack of standing of a taxpayer challenging
Bible reading in the classroom. The taxpayer’s action in Doremus,
the Court wrote, “is not a direct dollars-and-cents injury but is a
religious difference.” 398 This rationale was similar to the spending
program-regulatory program distinction of Flast. But, even a dollar-
and-cents injury resulting from a state spending program will ap-
parently not constitute a direct dollars-and-cents injury. The Court
in Doremus wrote that a taxpayer challenging either a federal or a
state statute “must be able to show not only that the statute is in-
valid but that he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sus-
     393 Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2553, 2559 (2007).

This decision does not affect Establishment Clause cases in which the plaintiff can
allege a personal injury. A plaintiff who challenges a government display of a reli-
gious object, for example, need not sue as a taxpayer but may have standing “by
alleging that he has undertaken a ‘special burden’ or has altered his behavior to
avoid the object that gives him offense. . . . [I]t is enough for standing purposes that
a plaintiff allege that he ‘must come into direct and unwelcome contact with the
religious display to participate fully as [a] citizen[ ] . . . and to fulfill . . . legal obli-
gations.’ ” Books v. Elkhart County, 401 F.3d 857, 861 (7th Cir. 2005). In Van Orden
v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 682 (2005), the Court, without mentioning standing, noted
that the plaintiff “has encountered the Ten Commandments monument during his
frequent visits to the [Texas State] Capitol grounds. His visits are typically for the
purpose of using the law library in the Supreme Court building, which is located
just northwest of the Capitol building.”
     394 127 S. Ct. at 2568 (citations omitted). Justices Scalia and Thomas concurred

in the judgment but would have overruled Flast. Justice Souter, joined by three other
justices, dissented because he saw no logic in the distinction the plurality drew, as
the plurality did not and could not have suggested that the taxpayers in Hein “have
any less stake in the outcome than the taxpayers in Flast.” Id. at 2584.
     395 330 U.S. 1 (1947). In DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 349 (2006),

the Court held that a plaintiff ’s status as a municipal taxpayer does not give him
standing to challenge a state tax credit.
