States,205 and the theory of constructive contempt based on the “rea-
sonable tendency” rule was rejected. The defendants in the civil suit,
by persuasion and the use of liquor, had induced a plaintiff feeble
in mind and body to ask for dismissal of the suit he had brought
against them. The events in the episode occurred more than 100
miles from where the court was sitting and were held not to put
the persons responsible for them in contempt of court. Although Nye
v. United States was exclusively a case of statutory construction, it
was significant from a constitutional point of view because its rea-
soning was contrary to that of earlier cases narrowly construing the
act of 1831 and asserting broad inherent powers of courts to pun-
ish contempts independently of, and contrary to, congressional regu-
lation of this power. Bridges v. California 206 was noteworthy for the
dictum of the majority that the contempt power of all courts, fed-
eral as well as state, is limited by the guaranty of the First Amend-
ment against interference with freedom of speech or of the press.207
    A series of cases involving highly publicized trials and much news
media attention and exploitation,208 however, caused the Court to
suggest that the contempt and other powers of trial courts should
be used to stem the flow of publicity before it can taint a trial. Thus,
Justice Clark, speaking for the majority in Sheppard v. Maxwell,209
wrote, “If publicity during the proceedings threatens the fairness of
the trial, a new trial should be ordered. But we must remember
that reversals are but palliatives; the cure lies in those remedial
measures that will prevent the prejudice at its inception. . . . Nei-
ther prosecutors, counsel for defense, the accused, witness, court staff
nor law enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the
court should be permitted to frustrate its function. Collaboration
between counsel and the press as to information affecting the fair-
ness of a criminal trial is not only subject to regulation, but is highly
censurable and worthy of disciplinary measures.” Though the regu-

    207 See also Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375 (1962), further clarifying the limita-

tions imposed by the First Amendment upon this judicial power and delineating the
requisite serious degree of harm to the administration of law necessary to justify
exercise of the contempt power to punish the publisher of an out-of-court statement
attacking a charge to the grand jury, absent any showing of actual interference with
the activities of the grand jury.
    It is now clearly established that courtroom conduct to be punishable as con-
tempt “must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administra-
tion of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immedi-
ately imperil.” Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 376 (1947); In re Little, 404 U.S. 553,
