been passed on the subject.” 1173 Later Justices viewed the matter
differently from Marshall. “By the constitution of the United States,”
it was said in one opinion, “the Supreme Court possesses no appel-
late power in any case, unless conferred upon it by act of Con-
gress.” 1174 In order for a case to come within its appellate jurisdic-
tion, the Court has said, “two things must concur: the Constitution
must give the capacity to take it, and an act of Congress must sup-
ply the requisite authority.” Moreover, “it is for Congress to deter-
mine how far, within the limits of the capacity of this court to take,
appellate jurisdiction shall be given, and when conferred, it can be
exercised only to the extent and in the manner prescribed by law.
In these respects it is wholly the creature of legislation.” 1175
     This congressional power, conferred by the language of Article
III, § 2, cl. 2, which provides that all jurisdiction not original is to
be appellate, “with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations
as the Congress shall make,” has been utilized to forestall a deci-
sion which the congressional majority assumed would be adverse
to its course of action. In Ex parte McCardle,1176 the Court ac-
cepted review on certiorari of a denial of a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus by the circuit court; the petition was by a civilian
convicted by a military commission of acts obstructing Reconstruc-
tion. Anticipating that the Court might void, or at least under-
mine, congressional reconstruction of the Confederate States, Con-
gress enacted over the President’s veto a provision repealing the
act which authorized the appeal McCardle had taken.1177 Although
the Court had already heard argument on the merits, it then dis-

    1173 Durousseau v. United States, 10 U.S. (6 Cr.) 307, 313–314 (1810). “Courts

which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by written law,
cannot transcend that jurisdiction.” Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75, 93 (1807)
(Chief Justice Marshall). Marshall had earlier expressed his Durousseau thoughts
in United States v. More, 7 U.S. (3 Cr.) 159 (1805).
    1174 Barry v. Mercein, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 103, 119 (1847) (case held nonreviewable

because minimum jurisdictional amount not alleged).
    1175 Daniels v. Railroad Co., 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 250, 254 (1865) (case held nonreview-

able because certificate of division in circuit did not set forth questions in dispute
as provided by statute).
    1176 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 318 (1868). That Congress’s apprehensions might have had

a basis in fact, see C. FAIRMAN, HISTORY OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
VOL. VI, PT. I: RECONSTRUCTION AND REUNION 1864–88 493–495 (1971). McCardle is fully
reviewed at pp. 433–514.
    1177 By the Act of February 5, 1867, § 1, 14 Stat. 386, Congress had authorized

appeals to the Supreme Court from circuit court decisions denying habeas corpus.
Previous to this statute, the Court’s jurisdiction to review habeas corpus decisions,
based in § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 81, was somewhat fuzzily con-
ceived. Compare United States v. Hamilton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 17 (1795), and Ex parte
Burford, 7 U.S. (3 Cr.) 448 (1806), with Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75 (1807).
The repealing statute was the Act of March 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 44. The repealed act
was reenacted March 3, 1885. 23 Stat. 437.
