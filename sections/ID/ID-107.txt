counterpart in civil litigation in which a lower court judgment may
still have certain present or future adverse effects on the challeng-
ing party.561
    A second exception, the “voluntary cessation” doctrine, focuses
on the likelihood of discontinued conduct recurring or a superseded
statute being renewed.562 Cessation of a challenged activity by vol-
untary choice, especially of an activity the actor claims was proper,
will moot a case only if it can be said with assurance “that ‘there is
no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.’ ” 563 A
person asserting mootness through voluntary cessation bears the
“formidable burden” of showing with absolute clarity that there is
no reasonable prospect of renewed activity.564 Otherwise, “[t]he de-
fendant is free to return to his old ways” and this fact would be
enough to prevent mootness because of the “public interest in hav-
ing the legality of the practices settled.” 565
    Still a third exception concerns the ability to challenge short-
term conduct which may recur in the future, which has been de-
nominated as disputes “capable of repetition, yet evading re-
view.” 566 Thus, in cases in which (1) the challenged action is too
short in its duration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or
expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same
review at the instance of the prosecution as well as defendant. Pennsylvania v. Mimms,
434 U.S. 106 (1977). When a convicted defendant dies while his case is on direct
review, the Court’s present practice is to dismiss the petition for certiorari. Dove v.
