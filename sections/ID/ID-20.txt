not over localities,” a presumption arises that the status of such a
tribunal is constitutional rather than legislative.91 The other four
Justices expressly declared that Bakelite and Williams should not
be overruled,92 but two of them thought that the two courts had
attained constitutional status by virtue of the clear manifestation
of congressional intent expressed in the legislation.93 Two Justices
maintained that both courts remained legislative tribunals.94 Al-
though the result is clear, no standard for pronouncing a court leg-
islative rather than constitutional obtained the adherence of a ma-
jority of the Court.95
     Status of Courts of the District of Columbia.—Through a
long course of decisions, the courts of the District of Columbia were
regarded as legislative courts upon which Congress could impose
nonjudicial functions. In Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe,96
the Court sustained an act of Congress which conferred revisory
powers upon the Supreme Court of the District in patent appeals
and made its decisions binding only upon the Commissioner of Pat-
ents. Similarly, the Court later sustained the authority of Congress
to vest revisory powers in the same court over rates fixed by a pub-
lic utilities commission.97 Not long after this the same rule was ap-
plied to the revisory powers of the District Supreme Court over or-
ders of the Federal Radio Commission.98 These rulings were based
on the assumption, express or implied, that the courts of the Dis-
trict were legislative courts, created by Congress pursuant to its
plenary power to govern the District of Columbia. In dictum in Ex
parte Bakelite Corp.,99 while reviewing the history and analyzing
the nature of the legislative courts, the Court stated that the courts
of the District were legislative courts.

    91  370 U.S. at 548, 552.
    92  370 U.S. at 585 (Justice Clark and Chief Justice Warren concurring), 589 (Jus-
tices Douglas and Black dissenting).
     93 370 U.S. at 585 (Justice Clark and Chief Justice Warren).
     94 370 U.S. at 589 (Justices Douglas and Black). The concurrence thought that

the rationale of Bakelite and Williams was based on a significant advisory and refer-
ence business of the two courts, which the two Justices now thought insignificant,
but what there was of it they thought nonjudicial and the courts should not enter-
tain it. Justice Harlan left that question open. Id. at 583.
     95 Aside from doctrinal matters, Congress in 1982 created the United States Court

of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, giving it, inter alia, the appellate jurisdiction of
the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. 96 Stat. 25, title
1, 28 U.S.C. § 41. At the same time Congress created the United States Claims Court,
now the United States Court of Federal Claims, as an Article I tribunal, with the
trial jurisdiction of the old Court of Claims. 96 Stat. 26, as amended, § 902(a)(1),
106 Stat. 4516, 28 U.S.C. §§ 171–180.
     96 112 U.S. 50 (1884).
     97 Keller v. Potomac Elec. Co., 261 U.S. 428 (1923).
     98 Federal Radio Comm’n v. General Elec. Co., 281 U.S. 464 (1930).
     99 279 U.S. 438, 450–455 (1929).
