    Clause 2. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Pun-
ishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Cor-
ruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Per-
son attainted.

              CORRUPTION OF THE BLOOD AND FORFEITURE
            The Confiscation Act of 1862 “to suppress Insurrection, to pun-
        ish Treason and Rebellion, to seize and confiscate the Property of
        Rebels” 1440 raised issues under Article III, § 3, cl. 2. Because of the
        constitutional doubts of the President, the act was accompanied by
        an explanatory joint resolution which stipulated that only a life es-
        tate terminating with the death of the offender could be sold and
        that at his death his children could take the fee simple by descent
        as his heirs without deriving any title from the United States. In
        applying this act, passed pursuant to the war power and not the
        power to punish treason,1441 the Court in one case 1442 quoted with
        approval the English distinction between a disability absolute and
        perpetual and one personal or temporary. Corruption of blood as a
        result of attainder of treason was cited as an example of the for-
        mer and was defined as the disability of any of the posterity of the
        attained person “to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as
        heir to him, or to any ancestor above him.” 1443

             1443 Lord de la Warre’s Case, 11 Coke Rept. 1a, 77 Eng. Rept. 1145 (1597). A

        number of cases dealt with the effect of a full pardon by the President of owners of
        property confiscated under this act. They held that a full pardon relieved the owner
        of forfeiture as far as the government was concerned but did not divide the interest
        acquired by third persons from the government during the lifetime of the offender.
        Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Bosworth, 133 U.S. 92, 101 (1890); Knote v. United States, 95
        U.S. 149 (1877); Wallach v. Van Riswick, 92 U.S. 202, 203 (1876); Armstrong’s Foundry,
        73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 766, 769 (1868). There is no direct ruling on the question of whether
        only citizens can commit treason. In Carlisle v. United States, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.)
        147, 154–155 (1873), the Court declared that aliens while domiciled in this country
        owe a temporary allegiance to it and may be punished for treason equally with a
        native-born citizen in the absence of a treaty stipulation to the contrary. This case
        involved the attempt of certain British subjects to recover claims for property seized
        under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act, 12 Stat. 820 (1863), which pro-
        vided for the recovery of property or its value in suits in the Court of Claims by
        persons who had not rendered aid and comfort to the enemy. Earlier, in United States
        v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 97 (1820), which involved a conviction for man-
        slaughter under an act punishing manslaughter and treason on the high seas, Chief
        Justice Marshall going beyond the necessities of the case stated that treason “is a
        breach of allegiance, and can be committed by him only who owes allegiance either
        perpetual or temporary.” However, see In re Shinohara, Court Martial Orders, No.
