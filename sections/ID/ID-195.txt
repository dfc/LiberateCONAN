right of foreign corporations to resort to federal courts in diversity
is not one that the states may condition as a qualification for doing
business in the state.1084
     Unincorporated associations, such as partnerships, joint stock
companies, labor unions, governing boards of institutions, and the
like, do not enjoy the same privilege as a corporation; the actual
citizenship of each of its members must be considered in determin-
ing whether diversity exists.1085
    Manufactured Diversity.—A litigant who, because of diver-
sity of citizenship, can choose whether to sue in state or federal
court, will properly consider where the advantages and disadvan-
tages balance, and if diversity is lacking, a litigant who perceives
the balance to favor the federal forum will sometimes attempt to
create diversity. In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress exempted
from diversity jurisdiction suits on choses of action in favor of an
assignee unless the suit could have been brought in federal court if
no assignment had been made.1086 One could create diversity by a
bona fide change of domicile even with the sole motive of creating
domicile.1087 Similarly, one could create diversity, or defeat it, by
choosing a personal representative of the requisite citizenship.1088
Most attempts to manufacture or create diversity have involved cor-
porations. A corporation cannot get into federal court by transfer-
ring its claim to a subsidiary incorporated in another state,1089 and
for a time the Supreme Court tended to look askance at collusory
incorporations and the creation of dummy corporations for pur-
poses of creating diversity.1090 But, in Black & White Taxicab & Trans-

     1084 In Terral v. Burke Constr. Co., 257 U.S. 529 (1922), the Court resolved two

conflicting lines of cases and voided a state statute that required the cancellation of
the license of a foreign corporation to do business in the state upon notice that the
corporation had removed a case to a federal court.

Co. v. Jones, 177 U.S. 449 (1900); Thomas v. Board of Trustees, 195 U.S. 207 (1904);
United Steelworkers v. R.H. Bouligny, Inc., 382 U.S. 145 (1965); Carden v. Arkoma
Associates, 494 U.S. 185 (1990). But compare People of Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co.,
288 U.S. 476 (1933), distinguished in Carden, 494 U.S. at 189–190, and Navarro
Savings Ass’n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458 (1980), distinguished in Carden, 494 U.S. at 191–

     1086 Ch. XIX, § 11, 1 Stat. 78, sustained in Turner v. Bank of North America, 4

U.S. (4 Dall.) 8 (1799), and Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850). The present
statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1359, provides that no jurisdiction exists in a civil action “in
which any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made
or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.” See Kramer v. Caribbean Mills,
394 U.S. 823 (1969).
