sumes the form of a suit at common law.1239 Review of state court
decisions by the United States Supreme Court is intended to pro-
tect the federal interest and promote uniformity of law and deci-
sion relating to the federal interest.1240 The first category of con-
flict surfaces here. The second broader category arises from the fact
that state interests, actions, and wishes, all of which may at times
be effectuated through state courts, are variously subject to re-
straint by federal courts. Although the possibility always ex-
isted,1241 it became much more significant and likely when, in the
wake of the Civil War, Congress bestowed general federal question
jurisdiction on the federal courts,1242 enacted a series of civil rights
statutes and conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce
them,1243 and most important proposed and saw to the ratification
of the three constitutional amendments, especially the Fourteenth,
which made an ever-increasing number of state actions subject to
federal scrutiny.1244
The Autonomy of State Courts
     Noncompliance With and Disobedience of Supreme Court
Orders by State Courts.—The United States Supreme Court when
deciding cases on review from the state courts usually remands the
case to the state court when it reverses for “proceedings not incon-
sistent” with the Court’s opinion. This disposition leaves open the
possibility that unresolved issues of state law will be decided ad-
versely to the party prevailing in the Supreme Court or that the
state court will so interpret the facts or the Court’s opinion to the
detriment of the party prevailing in the Supreme Court.1245 When
it is alleged that the state court has deviated from the Supreme
     1239 Through the “saving to suitors” clause, 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1). See Madruga v.

Superior Court, 346 U.S. 556, 560–61 (1954).
     1240 See “Organization of Courts, Tenure, and Compensation of Judges” and

“Marbury v. Madison,” supra. See also 28 U.S.C. § 1257.
     1241 E.g., by a suit against a state by a citizen of another state directly in the

Supreme Court, Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793), which was over-
turned by the Eleventh Amendment; by suits in diversity or removal from state courts
where diversity existed, 1 Stat. 78, 79; by suits by aliens on treaties, 1 Stat. 77,
and, subsequently, by removal from state courts of certain actions. 3 Stat. 198. And
for some unknown reason, Congress passed in 1793 a statute prohibiting federal
court injunctions against state court proceedings. See Toucey v. New York Life Ins.
Co., 314 U.S. 118, 120–32 (1941).
     1242 Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470.
     1243 Civil Rights Act of 1871, § 1, 17 Stat. 13. The authorization for equitable

relief is now 42 U.S.C. § 1983, while jurisdiction is granted by 28 U.S.C. § 1343.
