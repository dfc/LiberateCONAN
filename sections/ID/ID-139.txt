constitutional attack, a rule of prudence is that it should be so con-
strued,738 even though in some instances this “constitutional doubt”
maxim has caused the Court to read a statute in a manner that
defeats or impairs the legislative purpose.739 Of course, the Court
stresses that “[w]e cannot press statutory construction ‘to the point
of disingenuous evasion’ even to avoid a constitutional ques-
tion.” 740 The maxim is not followed if the provision would survive
constitutional attack or if the text is clear.741 Closely related to this
principle is the maxim that, when part of a statute is valid and
part is void, the courts will separate the valid from the invalid and
save as much as possible.742 Statutes today ordinarily expressly pro-
vide for separability, but it remains for the courts in the last resort
to determine whether the provisions are separable.743
     Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law.—Adherence to prec-
edent ordinarily limits and shapes the approach of courts to deci-
sion of a presented question. “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy,
because in most matters it is more important that the applicable
rule of law be settled than that it be settled right . . . . This is com-
monly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, pro-
vided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving
the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative ac-
tion is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its ear-
lier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the
force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and
error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the
