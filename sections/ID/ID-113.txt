the creation of new law, through overrulings or otherwise, may re-
sult in retroactivity in all instances, in pure prospectivity, or in par-
tial prospectivity in which the prevailing party obtains the results
of the new rule but no one else does. In two cases raising the ques-
tion when states are required to refund taxes collected under a stat-
ute that is subsequently ruled unconstitutional, the Court revealed
itself to be deeply divided.599 The question in Beam was whether
the company could claim a tax refund under an earlier ruling hold-
ing unconstitutional the imposition of certain taxes upon its prod-
ucts. The holding of a fractionated Court was that it could seek a
refund, because in the earlier ruling the Court had applied the hold-
ing to the contesting company, and, once a new rule has been ap-
plied retroactively to the litigants in a civil case, considerations of
equality and stare decisis compel application to all.600 Although par-
tial or selective prospectivity is thus ruled out, neither pure retro-
activity nor pure prospectivity is either required or forbidden.
     Four Justices adhered to the principle that new rules, as de-
fined above, may be applied purely prospectively, without violating
any tenet of Article III or any other constitutional value.601 Three
Justices argued that all prospectivity, whether partial or total, vio-
lates Article III by expanding the jurisdiction of the federal courts
beyond true cases and controversies.602 Apparently, the Court now
has resolved this dispute, although the principal decision was by a
five-to-four vote. In Harper v. Virginia Dep’t of Taxation,603 the Court
adopted the principle of the Griffith decision in criminal cases and
disregarded the Chevron Oil approach in civil cases. Henceforth, in
pression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. The courts must look to
the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retro-
spective operation will further or retard its operation. Then, the courts must look to
see whether a decision to apply retroactively a decision will produce substantial in-
equitable results. Id. at 106–07. American Trucking Assn’s v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167,
179–86 (1990) (plurality opinion).

ing Assn’s, Inc. v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167 (1990).
      600 The holding described in the text is expressly that of only a two-Justice plu-

rality. 501 U.S. at 534–44 (Justices Souter and Stevens). Justice White, Justice
Blackmun, and Justice Scalia (with Justice Marshall joining the latter Justices) con-
curred, id. at 544, 547, 548 (respectively), but on other, and in the instance of the
three latter Justices, and broader justifications. Justices O’Connor and Kennedy and
Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented. Id. at 549.
      601 501 U.S. at 549 (dissenting opinion of Justices O’Connor and Kennedy and

Chief Justice Rehnquist), and id. at 544 (Justice White concurring). See also Smith,
496 U.S. at 171 (plurality opinion of Justices O’Connor, White, Kennedy, and Chief
Justice Rehnquist).
      602 501 U.S. at 547, 548 (Justices Blackmun, Scalia, and Marshall concurring).

In Smith, 496 U.S. at 205, these three Justices had joined the dissenting opinion of
Justice Stevens arguing that constitutional decisions must be given retroactive ef-
fect.
