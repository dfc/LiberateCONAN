who had not gone to trial. At first, the Court drew the line at cases
in which judgments of conviction were not yet final, so that all per-
sons in those situations obtained retrospective use of decisions,586
but the Court later promulgated standards for a balancing process
that resulted in different degrees of retroactivity in different cases.587
Generally, in cases in which the Court declared a rule that was “a
clear break with the past,” it denied retroactivity to all defendants,
with the sometime exception of the appellant himself.588 With re-
spect to certain cases in which a new rule was intended to over-
come an impairment of the truth-finding function of a criminal trial 589
or to cases in which the Court found that a constitutional doctrine
barred the conviction or punishment of someone,590 full retroactiv-
ity, even to habeas claimants, was the rule. Justice Harlan strongly
argued that the Court should sweep away its confusing balancing
rules and hold that all defendants whose cases are still pending on
direct appeal at the time of a law-changing decision should be en-
titled to invoke the new rule, but that no habeas claimant should
be entitled to benefit.591
    The Court later drew a sharp distinction between criminal cases
pending on direct review and cases pending on collateral review.
For cases on direct review, “a new rule for the conduct of criminal
prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or fed-
eral, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception
for cases in which the new rule constitutes a ‘clear break’ with the
past.” 592 Justice Harlan’s habeas approach was first adopted by a
plurality in Teague v. Lane 593 and then by the Court in Penry v.
