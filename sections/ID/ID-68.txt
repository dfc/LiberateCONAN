ment in its sovereign capacity, and concerning which the only judg-
ment required is to settle the doubtful character of the legislation
in question.” 359
    Concerns regarding adversity are also raised when the Execu-
tive Branch chooses to enforce, but not defend, federal statutes which
it has concluded are unconstitutional. In United States v. Wind-
sor,360 the Court considered the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
which excludes same-sex partners from the definition of “spouse”
as used in federal statutes.361 DOMA was challenged by the surviv-
ing member of a same-sex couple (married in Canada) who was seek-
ing to claim a spousal federal estate tax exemption. Although the
Executive Branch continued to deny the exemption, it also declined
to defend the statute based on doubts as to whether it would sur-
vive scrutiny under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amend-
ment. Consequently, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House
of Representatives (BLAG) 362 intervened to defend the statute. The
Court noted that despite the decision not to defend, the failure of
the United States to provide a refund to the taxpayer consituted
an injury sufficient to establish standing, leaving only “prudential”
limitations on judicial review at issue.363 Here, the Court found that
the “prudential” concerns were outweighed by the presence of BLAG
to offer an adversarial presentation of the issue, the legal uncer-
tainty that would be caused by dismissing the case, and concern
that the Executive Branch would otherwise be given a route to evade
review of allegedly unconstitutional statutes by the Court.
    Collusive and Feigned Suits.—Adverse litigants are lacking
in those suits in which two parties have gotten together to bring a
friendly suit to settle a question of interest to them. Thus, in Lord
v. Veazie,364 the latter had executed a deed to the former warrant-
ing that he had certain rights claimed by a third person, and suit
    359 219 U.S. at 361–62. The Indians obtained the sought-after decision the fol-

lowing year by the simple expedient of suing to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior
from enforcing the disputed statute. Gritts v. Fisher, 224 U.S. 640 (1912). Other cases
have involved similar problems, but they resulted in decisions on the merits. E.g.,
Cherokee Intermarriage Cases, 203 U.S. 76 (1906); La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United
States, 175 U.S. 423, 455–463 (1899); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301,
335 (1966); but see id. at 357 (Justice Black dissenting). The principal effect of Musk-
rat was to put in doubt for several years the validity of any sort of declaratory judg-
ment provision in federal law.
