given in the constitution,” the right of the United States to sue in
its own courts “is clearly implied in that part respecting the judi-
cial power. . . . Indeed, all the usual incidents appertaining to a
personal sovereign, in relation to contracts, and suing, and enforc-
ing rights, so far as they are within the scope of the powers of the
government, belong to the United States, as they do to other sover-
eigns.” 949 As early as 1818, the Supreme Court ruled that the United
States could sue in its own name in all cases of contract without
congressional authorization of such suits.950 Later, this rule was ex-
tended to other types of actions. In the absence of statutory provi-
sions to the contrary, such suits are initiated by the Attorney Gen-
eral in the name of the United States.951
     By the Judiciary Act of 1789, and subsequent amendments to
it, Congress has vested in the federal district courts jurisdiction to
hear all suits of a civil nature at law or in equity brought by the
United States as party plaintiff.952 As in other judicial proceedings,
the United States, like any party plaintiff, must have an interest
in the subject matter and a legal right to the remedy sought.953 Un-
der the long-settled principle that the courts have the power to abate
public nuisances at the suit of the government, the provision in § 208(2)
of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1949, authorizing fed-
eral courts to enjoin strikes that imperil national health or safety
was upheld on the grounds that the statute entrusts the courts with
the determination of a “case or controversy” on which the judicial
power can operate and does not impose any legislative, executive,
or non-judicial function. Moreover, the fact that the rights sought
to be protected were those of the public in unimpeded production

Whether without statutory authorization the United States may sue to protect the
constitutional rights of its citizens has occasioned conflict. Compare United States v.
Brand Jewelers, 318 F. Supp. 1293 (S.D.N.Y. 1970), and United States v. Brittain,
319 F. Supp. 1658 (S.D.Ala. 1970), with United States v. Mattson, 600 F.2d 1295
(9th Cir. 1979), and United States v. Solomon, 563 F.2d 1121 (4th Cir. 1977). The
result in Mattson and Solomon was altered by specific authorization in the Civil
Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Pub. L. 96–247, 94 Stat. 349 (1980), 42 U.S.C.
§§ 1997 et seq. See also United States v. City of Philadelphia, 644 F.2d 187 (3d Cir.
1980) (no standing to sue to correct allegedly unconstitutional police practices).
     952 28 U.S.C. § 1345. By virtue of the fact that the original jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court extends only to those cases enumerated in the Constitution, jurisdic-
tion over suits brought by the United States against persons or corporations is vested
in the lower federal courts. Suits by the United States against a state may be brought
in the Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1251(b)(2), al-
though such suits may also be brought in the district courts. Case v. Bowles, 327
