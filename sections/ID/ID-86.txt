stantial dispute arose in Singleton v. Wulff 449 over whether doctors
who were denied Medicaid funds for the performance of abortions
not “medically indicated” could assert the rights of absent women.
All the Justices thought the Court should be hesitant to resolve a
controversy on the basis of the rights of third parties, but they di-
vided with respect to the standards exceptions. Four Justices fa-
vored a lenient standard, permitting third party representation when
there is a close, perhaps confidential, relationship between the liti-
gant and the third parties and when there is some genuine ob-
stacle to third party assertion of their rights; four Justices would
have permitted a litigant to assert the rights of third parties only
when government directly interdicted the relationship between the
litigant and the third parties through the criminal process and when
litigation by the third parties is in all practicable terms impos-
sible.450
    Following Wulff, the Court, emphasizing the closeness of the
attorney-client relationship, held that a lawyer had standing to as-
sert his client’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel in challenging
application of a drug-forfeiture law to deprive the client of the means
of paying counsel.451 However, a “next friend” whose stake in the
outcome is only speculative must establish that the real party in
interest is unable to litigate his own cause because of mental inca-
pacity, lack of access to courts, or other disability.452
    A variant of the general rule is that one may not assert the
unconstitutionality of a statute in other respects when the statute
is constitutional as to him.453 Again, the exceptions may be more
important than the rule. Thus, an overly broad statute, especially
one that regulates speech and press, may be considered on its face

minorities from petit and grand juries, both on the basis of the injury-in-fact to de-
fendants and because the standards for being able to assert the rights of third par-
ties were met. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991); Campbell v. Louisiana, 523 U.S.
392 (1998).
     449 428 U.S. 106 (1976).
     450 Compare 428 U.S. at 112–18 (Justices Blackmun, Brennan, White, and Mar-

shall), with id. at 123–31 (Justices Powell, Stewart, and Rehnquist, and Chief Jus-
tice Burger). Justice Stevens concurred with the former four Justices on narrower
grounds limited to this case.
     451 Caplin & Drysdale v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 623–624 n.3 (1989). Caplin

& Drysdale was distinguished in Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 123, 131 (2004), the
Court’s finding that attorneys seeking to represent hypothetical indigent clients in
challenging procedures for appointing appellate counsel had “no relationship at all”
with such potential clients, let alone a “close” relationship.
     452 Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149 (1990) (death row inmate’s challenge to

death penalty imposed on a fellow inmate who knowingly, intelligently, and volun-
tarily chose not to appeal cannot be pursued).
     453 United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21–24 (1960).
