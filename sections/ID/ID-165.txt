to admiralty courts,896 such actions in state courts have been sus-
tained in cases of forfeiture arising out of violations of state law.897
    Perhaps the most significant admiralty court difference in pro-
cedure from civil courts is the absence of a jury trial in admiralty
actions, with the admiralty judge trying issues of fact as well as of
law.898 Indeed, the absence of a jury in admiralty proceedings ap-
pears to have been one of the principal reasons why the English
government vested a broad admiralty jurisdiction in the colonial vice-
admiralty courts, since they provided a forum where the English
authorities could enforce the Navigation Laws without “the obsti-
nate resistance of American juries.” 899
    Territorial Extent of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction.—
Although he was a vigorous exponent of the expansion of admi-
ralty jurisdiction, Justice Story for the Court in The Steamboat Thomas
Jefferson 900 adopted a restrictive English rule confining admiralty
jurisdiction to the high seas and upon rivers as far as the ebb and
flow of the tide extended.901 The demands of commerce on western
waters led Congress to enact a statute extending admiralty jurisdic-
tion over the Great Lakes and connecting waters,902 and in The Genes-
see Chief v. Fitzhugh 903 Chief Justice Taney overruled The Thomas
Jefferson and dropped the tidal ebb and flow requirement. This rul-
ing laid the basis for subsequent judicial extension of jurisdiction
over all waters, salt or fresh, tidal or not, which are navigable in
fact.904 Some of the older cases contain language limiting jurisdic-

ship and the requisite jurisdictional amounts are present, a suitor may sue on the
“law side” of the federal court and obtain a jury. Romero v. International Terminal
Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 362–363 (1959). Jones Act claims, 41 Stat. 1007 (1920),
