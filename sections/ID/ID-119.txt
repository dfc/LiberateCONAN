regard to the existence of a state of war and the dates of the begin-
ning and ending and of states of belligerency between foreign pow-
ers, but the deference has sometimes been forced.642
    4. Enactment or Ratification of Laws. Ordinarily, the Court will
not look behind the fact of certification as to whether the stan-
dards requisite for the enactment of legislation 643 or ratification of
a constitutional amendment 644 have in fact been met, although it
will interpret the Constitution to determine what the basic stan-
dards are.645 Further, the Court will decide certain questions if the
political branches are in disagreement.646
    From this limited review of the principal areas in which the
political question doctrine seemed most established, it is possible
to extract some factors that seemingly convinced the courts that the
issues presented went beyond the judicial responsibility. These fac-
tors, stated baldly, would appear to be the lack of requisite informa-
tion and the difficulty of obtaining it,647 the necessity for unifor-
mity of decision and deference to the wider responsibilities of the
political departments,648 and the lack of adequate standards to re-
solve a dispute.649 But present in all the political cases was (and

Pastora, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 52 (1819). The cases involving the status of Indian tribes
as foreign states usually but not always have presented political questions. The Chero-
kee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1 (1831); United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S.
28 (1913); Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832).
     643 Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892); Harwood v. Wentworth, 162 U.S. 547

(1896); cf. Gardner v. The Collector, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 499 (1868). See, for the mod-
ern formulation, United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385 (1990).
     644 Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939) (Congressâ€™s discretion to determine

     648 See, e.g., Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 415, 420 (1839). Simi-

lar considerations underlay the opinion in Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849),
in which Chief Justice Taney wondered how a court decision in favor of one faction
would be received with Congress seating the representatives of the other faction and
the President supporting that faction with military force.
