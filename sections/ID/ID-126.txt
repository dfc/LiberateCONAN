                              JUDICIAL REVIEW

The Establishment of Judicial Review
    Judicial review is one of the distinctive features of United States
constitutional law. It is no small wonder, then, to find that the power
of the federal courts to test federal and state legislative enact-
ments and other actions by the standards of what the Constitution
grants and withholds is nowhere expressly conveyed. But it is hardly
noteworthy that its legitimacy has been challenged from the first,
and, while now accepted generally, it still has detractors and its
supporters disagree about its doctrinal basis and its application.680
Although it was first asserted in Marbury v. Madison 681 to strike
down an act of Congress as inconsistent with the Constitution, ju-
dicial review did not spring full-blown from the brain of Chief Jus-
tice Marshall. The concept had been long known, having been uti-
lized in a much more limited form by Privy Council review of colonial
legislation and its validity under the colonial charters,682 and there
were several instances known to the Framers of state court invali-
dation of state legislation as inconsistent with state constitu-
tions.683
    Practically all of the framers who expressed an opinion on the
issue in the Convention appear to have assumed and welcomed the

review of the ongoing debate on the subject, in a work that now is a classic attack
on judicial review, is Westin, Introduction: Charles Beard and American Debate over
Judicial Review, 1790–1961, in C. BEARD, THE SUPREME COURT AND THE CONSTITUTION 1–34

focuses on judicial review of acts of Congress, the similar review of state acts has
occasioned much controversy as well.
