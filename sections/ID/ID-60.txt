The Rule-Making Power and Powers Over Process
    Among the incidental powers of courts is that of making all nec-
essary rules governing their process and practice and for the or-
derly conduct of their business.322 However, this power too is de-
rived from the statutes and cannot go beyond them. The landmark
case is Wayman v. Southard,323 which sustained the validity of the
Process Acts of 1789 and 1792 as a valid exercise of authority un-
der the necessary and proper clause. Although Chief Justice Mar-
shall regarded the rule-making power as essentially legislative in
nature, he ruled that Congress could delegate to the courts the power
to vary minor regulations in the outlines marked out by the stat-
ute. Fifty-seven years later, in Fink v. O’Neil,324 in which the United
States sought to enforce by summary process the payment of a debt,
the Supreme Court ruled that under the process acts the law of
Wisconsin was the law of the United States, and hence the govern-
ment was required to bring a suit, obtain a judgment, and cause
execution to issue. Justice Matthews for a unanimous Court de-
clared that the courts have “no inherent authority to take any one
of these steps, except as it may have been conferred by the legisla-
tive department; for they can exercise no jurisdiction, except as the
law confers and limits it.” 325 Conceding, in 1934, the limited com-
petence of legislative bodies to establish a comprehensive system of
court procedure, and acknowledging the inherent power of courts
to regulate the conduct of their business, Congress authorized the
Supreme Court to prescribe rules for the lower federal courts not
inconsistent with the Constitution and statutes.326 Their operation
being restricted, in conformity with the proviso attached to the con-
gressional authorization, to matters of pleading and practice, the
    322  Washington-Southern Nav. Co. v. Baltimore & P.S.B.C. Co., 263 U.S. 629 (1924).
    323  23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1 (1825).
     324 106 U.S. 272, 280 (1882).
     325 See Miner v. Atlass, 363 U.S. 641 (1960), holding that a federal district court,

sitting in admiralty, has no inherent power, independent of any statute or the Su-
preme Court’s Admiralty Rules, to order the taking of deposition for the purpose of
discovery. See also Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286 (1969), in which the Court found
statutory authority in the “All Writs Statute” for a habeas corpus court to propound
interrogatories.
     326 In the Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, and contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2072,

Congress, in authorizing promulgation of rules of civil procedure, reserved the power
to examine and override or amend rules proposed pursuant to the act which it found
to be contrary to its legislative policy. See Sibbach v. Wilson, 312 U.S. 1, 14–16 (1941).
Congress also has authorized promulgation of rules of criminal procedure, habeas,
evidence, admiralty, bankruptcy, and appellate procedure. See Hart & Wechsler (6th
ed.), supra at 533–543 (discussing development of rules and citing secondary author-
ity). Congress in the 1970s disagreed with the direction of proposed rules of evi-
dence and of habeas practice, and, first postponing their effectiveness, enacted re-
vised rules. Pub. L. 93–505, 88 Stat. 1926 (1974); Pub. L. 94–426, 90 Stat. 1334
(1976). On this and other actions, see Hart & Wechsler (6th ed.), supra.
