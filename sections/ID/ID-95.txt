tion and redressability has curbed access to citizen suits,494 but that
Congress may expansively confer substantial degrees of standing
through statutory creations of interests remains true.

The Requirement of a Real Interest
    Almost inseparable from the requirements of adverse parties and
substantial enough interests to confer standing is the requirement
that a real issue be presented, as contrasted with speculative, ab-
stract, hypothetical, or moot issues. It has long been the Court’s
“considered practice not to decide abstract, hypothetical or contin-
gent questions.” 495 A party cannot maintain a suit “for a mere dec-
laration in the air.” 496 In Texas v. ICC,497 the State attempted to
enjoin the enforcement of the Transportation Act of 1920 on the ground
that it invaded the reserved rights of the State. The Court dis-
missed the complaint as presenting no case or controversy, declar-
ing: “It is only where rights, in themselves appropriate subjects of
judicial cognizance, are being, or about to be, affected prejudicially
by the application or enforcement of a statute that its validity may
be called in question by a suitor and determined by an exertion of
the judicial power.” 498 And in Ashwander v. TVA,499 the Court re-
fused to decide any issue save that of the validity of the contracts
between the Authority and the Company. “The pronouncements, poli-
cies and program of the Tennessee Valley Authority and its direc-
tors, their motives and desires, did not give rise to a justiciable con-
troversy save as they had fruition in action of a definite and concrete
character constituting an actual or threatened interference with the
rights of the person complaining.” 500

Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990). But see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154
(1997) (fact that citizen suit provision of Endangered Species Act is directed at em-
powering suits to further environmental concerns does not mean that suitor who
alleges economic harm from enforcement of Act lacks standing); FEC v. Akins, 524
U.S. 11 (1998) (expansion of standing based on denial of access to information).

     500 297 U.S. at 324. Chief Justice Hughes cited New York v. Illinois, 274 U.S.

488 (1927), in which the Court dismissed as presenting abstract questions a suit
about the possible effects of the diversion of water from Lake Michigan upon hypo-
thetical water power developments in the indefinite future, and Arizona v. Califor-
nia, 283 U.S. 423 (1931), in which it was held that claims based merely upon as-
sumed potential invasions of rights were insufficient to warrant judicial intervention.
