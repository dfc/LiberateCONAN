McClesky v. Zant,1381 the Court construed the “abuse of the writ”
language to require a showing of both “cause and prejudice” before
a petitioner may allege in a second or later petition a ground or
grounds not alleged in the first. In other words, to avoid subse-
quent dismissal, a petitioner must allege in his first application all
the grounds he may have, unless he can show cause, some external
impediment, for his failure and some actual prejudice from the er-
ror alleged. If he cannot show cause and prejudice, the petitioner
may be heard only if she shows that a “fundamental miscarriage of
justice” will occur, which means she must make a “colorable show-
ing of factual innocence.” 1382
    Fifth, the Court abandoned the rules of Fay v. Noia, although
it was not until 1991 that it expressly overruled the case.1383 Fay,
it will be recalled, dealt with so-called procedural-bar circum-
stances; that is, if a defendant fails to assert a claim at the proper
time or in accordance with proper procedure under valid state rules,
and if the state then refuses to reach the merits of his claim and
rules against him solely because of the noncompliance with state
procedure, when may a petitioner present the claim in federal ha-
beas? The answer in Fay was that the federal court always had power
to review the claim but that it had discretion to deny relief to a
habeas claimant if it found that the prisoner had intentionally waived
his right to pursue his state remedy through a “deliberate bypass”
of state procedure.
    That is no longer the law. “In all cases in which a state pris-
oner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an
independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas re-
view of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate
cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged
violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the
claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Fay was
based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued
the importance of state procedural rules.” 1384 The “miscarriage-of-
justice” element is probably limited to cases in which actual inno-

    1382  499 U.S. at 489–97. The “actual innocence” element runs through the cases
under all the headings.

     1384 Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). The standard has been

developed in a long line of cases. Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233 (1973) (under
federal rules); Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536 (1976); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S.
107 (1982); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478 (1986); Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255
(1989). Coleman arose because the defendant’s attorney had filed his appeal in state
court three days late. Wainwright v. Sykes involved the failure of defendant to ob-
ject to the admission of inculpatory statements at the time of trial. Engle v. Isaac
involved a failure to object at trial to jury instructions.
