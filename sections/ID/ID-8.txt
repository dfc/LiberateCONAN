der bad conditions.22 Despite numerous efforts to change this system,
it persisted, except for one brief period, until 1891.23 Since then,
the federal judicial system has consisted of district courts with origi-
nal jurisdiction, intermediate appellate courts, and the Supreme Court.
    Abolition of Courts.—That Congress “may from time to time
ordain and establish” inferior courts would seem to imply that the
system may be reoriented from time to time and that Congress is
not restricted to the status quo but may expand and contract the
units of the system. But if the judges are to have life tenure, what
is to be done with them when the system is contracted? Unfortu-
nately, the first exercise of the power occurred in a highly politi-
cized situation, and no definite answer emerged. By the Judiciary
Act of February 13, 1801,24 passed in the closing weeks of the Adams
Administration, the districts were reorganized, and six circuit courts
consisting of three circuit judges each were created. Although Adams
appointed deserving Federalists to these so-called “midnight judge”
positions just before the change in administration, the Jef-
fersonians soon set in motion plans to repeal the Act, which were
carried out.25 No provision was made for the displaced judges, how-
ever, apparently under the theory that if there were no courts there
could be no judges to sit on them.26 The validity of the repeal was
questioned on related grounds in Stuart v. Laird,27 but Justice Paterson
rejected the challenge without directly addressing the issue of the
displaced judges.

garding the judicial system, WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, (J. Fitzpatrick ed., 1943),
31, Chief Justice Jay prepared a letter for the approval of the other Justices, declin-
ing to comment on the policy questions but raising several issues of constitutional-
ity, that the same man should not be appointed to two offices, that the offices were
incompatible, and that the act invaded the prerogatives of the President and Sen-
ate. 2 G. MCREE, LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF JAMES IREDELL 293–296 (1858). The letter

too established to be questioned.
