rejected the argument that the judge’s approving the petition had
not constituted a “judicial” act. The Court found “that the factors
determining whether an act by a judge is a ‘judicial’ one relate to
the nature of the act itself, i.e., whether it is a function normally
performed by a judge, and to the expectations of the parties, i.e.,
whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity. . . . Judge
Stump performed the type of act normally performed only by judges
and . . . he did so in his capacity as a [judge].” 171
    Although judges are generally immune from suits for damages,
the Court has held that a judge may be enjoined from enforcing a
court rule, such as a restriction on lawyer advertising that violates
the First Amendment.172 Similarly, a state court magistrate may be
enjoined from “imposing bail on persons arrested for nonjailable of-
fenses under Virginia law and . . . incarcerating those persons if
they could not meet the bail. . . .” 173 But what if the prevailing party,
as it did in these two cases, seeks an award of attorneys’ fees un-
der the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976? 174 The Court
found that “Congress intended to permit attorney’s fees awards in
cases in which prospective relief was properly awarded against de-
fendants who would be immune from damage awards.” 175 In fact,
“Congress’s intent could hardly be more plain. Judicial immunity is
no bar to the award of attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.” 176

           ANCILLARY POWERS OF FEDERAL COURTS

The Contempt Power
    Categories of Contempt.—Crucial to an understanding of the
history of the law governing the courts’ powers of contempt is an
awareness of the various kinds of contempt. With a few notable ex-

     171 435 U.S. at 362. Justice Stewart’s dissent, joined by Justices Marshall and

Powell, concluded that what Judge Stump did “was beyond the pale of anything that
could sensibly be called a judicial act.” Id. at 365. Indiana law, Justice Stewart wrote,
provided for administrative proceedings for the sterilization of certain people who
were institutionalized (which the girl in this case was not), and what Judge Stump
did “was in no way an act ‘normally performed by a judge.’ ” Id. at 367.
     172 Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United States, 446

U.S. 719 (1980).
     173 Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 524–25 (1984).
     174 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). Under this statute, “suits brought against individual of-

ficers for injunctive relief are for all practical purposes suits against the State it-
self,” and, therefore, the state must “bear the burden of the counsel fees award.”
Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 700 (1978).
     175 Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 738–39. This is not the case, however, when

judges are sued in their legislative capacity for having issued a rule. Id. at 734.
     176 Pulliam, 466 U.S. at 544. In 1996, Public Law 104–317, § 309, amended § 1988(b)

to preclude the award of attorneys’ fees in a suit against a judicial officer unless the
officer’s action “was clearly in excess of such officer’s jurisdiction.”
