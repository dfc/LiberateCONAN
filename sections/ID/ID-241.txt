    Habeas Corpus: Scope of the Writ.—At the English common
law, habeas corpus was available to attack pretrial detention and
confinement by executive order; it could not be used to question the
conviction of a person pursuant to the judgment of a court with ju-
risdiction over the person. That common law meaning was applied
in the federal courts.1344 Expansion began after the Civil War through
more liberal court interpretation of “jurisdiction.” Thus, one who had
already completed one sentence on a conviction was released from
custody on a second sentence on the ground that the court had lost
jurisdiction upon completion of the first sentence.1345 Then, the Court
held that the constitutionality of the statute upon which a charge
was based could be examined on habeas, because an unconstitu-
tional statute was said to deprive the trial court of its jurisdic-
tion. 1346 Other cases expanded the want-of-jurisdiction ratio-
nale.1347 But the modern status of the writ of habeas corpus may
be said to have been started in its development in Frank v.
Mangum,1348 in which the Court reviewed on habeas a murder con-
viction in a trial in which there was substantial evidence of mob
domination of the judicial process. This issue had been considered
and rejected by the state appeals court. The Supreme Court indi-
cated that, though it might initially have had jurisdiction, the trial
court could have lost it if mob domination rendered the proceed-
ings lacking in due process.
    Further, in order to determine if there had been a denial of due
process, a habeas court should examine the totality of the process,
including the appellate proceedings. Because Frank’s claim of mob
domination was reviewed fully and rejected by the state appellate
court, he had been afforded an adequate corrective process for any
denial of rights, and his custody did not violate the Constitution.

The expansive language used when Congress in 1867 extended the habeas power of
federal courts to state prisoners “restrained of . . . liberty in violation of the consti-
tution, or of any treaty or law of the United States . . . ,” 14 Stat. 385, could have
encouraged an expansion of the writ to persons convicted after trial.
     1345 Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1874).
     1346 Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880); Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241 (1886);

Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86 (1890); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886).
     1347 Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417 (1885); In re Nielsen, 131 U.S. 176 (1889); In

re Snow, 120 U.S. 274 (1887); but see Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. 18 (1876); Ex parte
Bigelow, 113 U.S. 328 (1885). It is possible that the Court expanded the office of the
writ because its reviewing power over federal convictions was closely limited. F. Frank-
furter & J. Landis, supra. Once such review was granted, the Court began to re-
strict the use of the writ. E.g., Glasgow v. Moyer, 225 U.S. 420 (1912); In re Lincoln,
202 U.S. 178 (1906); In re Morgan, 203 U.S. 96 (1906).
     1348 237 U.S. 309 (1915).
