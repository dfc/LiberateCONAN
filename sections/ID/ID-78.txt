nied them information respecting an organization that might or might
not be a political action committee.411 Another area where the Court
has interpreted this term liberally is injury to the interests of indi-
viduals and associations of individuals who use the environment,
affording them standing to challenge actions that threatened those
environmental conditions.412
     Even citizens who bring qui tam actions under the False Claims
Act—actions that entitle the plaintiff (“relator”) to a percentage of
any civil penalty assessed for violation—have been held to have stand-
ing, on the theory that the government has assigned a portion of
its damages claim to the plaintiff, and the assignee of a claim has
standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor.413 Cit-
ing this holding and historical precedent, the Court upheld the stand-
ing of an assignee who had promised to remit the proceeds of the
litigation to the assignor.414 The Court noted that “federal courts
routinely entertain suits which will result in relief for parties that
are not themselves directly bringing suit. Trustees bring suits to
benefit their trusts; guardians at litem bring suits to benefit their
wards; receivers bring suit to benefit their receiverships; assignees
in bankruptcy bring suit to benefit bankrupt estates; and so forth.” 415
     The Court has, however, indicated that for plaintiffs to have stand-
ing based on an injury to others, that there must be an element of
     411 That the injury was widely shared did not make the claimed injury a “gener-

alized grievance,” the Court held, but rather in this case, as in others, the denial of
the statutory right was found to be a concrete harm to each member of the class.
     412 Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972); United States v. SCRAP,

412 U.S. 669, 687–88 (1973); Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group,
438 U.S. 59, 72–74 (1978). But the Court has refused to credit general allegations of
injury untied to specific governmental actions. E.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
504 U.S. 555 (1992); Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990). SCRAP
in particular is disfavored as too broad. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at
566. Moreover, unlike the situation in taxpayer suits, there is no requirement of a
nexus between the injuries claimed and the constitutional rights asserted. In Duke
Power, 438 U.S. at 78–81, claimed environmental and health injuries grew out of
construction and operation of nuclear power plants but were not directly related to
the governmental action challenged, the limitation of liability and indemnification
in cases of nuclear accident. See also Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth. v. Citi-
zens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, 501 U.S. 252, 264–65 (1991); Friends of
the Earth v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167 (2000).
     413 Vermont Agency of Nat. Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765

(2000). The Court confirmed its conclusion by reference to the long tradition of qui
tam actions, since the Constitution’s restriction of judicial power to “cases” and “con-
troversies” has been interpreted to mean “cases and controversies of the sort tradi-
tionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.” Id. at 774.
     414 Sprint Communications Co., L.P. v. APCC Services, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 2531 (2008)

(payphone operators had assigned claims against long-distance carriers to “aggrega-
tors” to sue on their behalf). Chief Justice Roberts, in a dissent joined by Justices
Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, stated that the aggregators lacked standing because they
“have nothing to gain from their lawsuit.” Id. at 2549.
     415 128 S. Ct. at 2543.
