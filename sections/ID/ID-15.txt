conferred on a Secretary as well as on a commissioner. But [it] is
not judicial in either case, in the sense in which judicial power is
granted by the Constitution to the courts of the United States.” 62
    Review of Legislative Courts by Supreme Court.—Chief Jus-
tice Taney’s view, which would have been expressed in Gordon,63
that the judgments of legislative courts could never be reviewed by
the Supreme Court, was tacitly rejected in De Groot v. United States,64
in which the Court took jurisdiction from a final judgment of the
Court of Claims. Since the decision in this case, the authority of
the Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over legislative courts
has turned not upon the nature or status of such courts but rather
upon the nature of the proceeding before the lower court and the
finality of its judgment. The Supreme Court will neither review the
administrative proceedings of legislative courts nor entertain ap-
peals from the advisory or interlocutory decrees of such a body.65
But, in proceedings before a legislative court that are judicial in
nature, admit of a final judgment, and involve the performance of
judicial functions and therefore the exercise of judicial power, the
Court may be vested with appellate jurisdiction.66
    The “Public Rights” Distinction.—A major delineation of the
distinction between Article I courts and Article III courts appears
in Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.67 At issue
was a summary procedure, without benefit of the courts, for the col-
lection by the United States of moneys claimed to be due from one
of its own customs collectors. It was argued that the assessment
and collection was a judicial act carried out by nonjudicial officers
and was thus invalid under Article III. Accepting that the acts com-
plained of were judicial, the Court nonetheless sustained the act
by distinguishing between any act, “which, from its nature, is the
subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty,” which,

    63  The opinion in Gordon v. United States, 69 U.S. (2 Wall.) 561 (1864), had
originally been prepared by Chief Justice Taney, but, following his death and reargu-
ment of the case, the Court issued the cited opinion. The Court later directed the
publishing of Taney’s original opinion at 117 U.S. 697. See also United States v. Jones,
119 U.S. 477, 478 (1886), in which the Court noted that the official report of Chief
Justice Chase’s Gordon opinion and the Court’s own record showed differences and
quoted the record.
