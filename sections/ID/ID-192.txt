was “extraordinary that the courts of the United States, which are
open to aliens, and to the citizens of every state in the union, should
be closed upon them. But this is a subject for legislative, not for
judicial consideration.” 1061 The same rule was subsequently ap-
plied to citizens of the territories of the United States.1062
    Whether the Chief Justice had in mind a constitutional amend-
ment or a statute when he spoke of legislative consideration re-
mains unclear. Not until 1940, however, did Congress attempt to
meet the problem by statutorily conferring on federal district courts
jurisdiction of civil actions, not involving federal questions, “be-
tween citizens of different States, or citizens of the District of Co-
lumbia, the Territory of Hawaii, or Alaska and any State or Terri-
tory.” 1063 In National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co.,1064
this act was upheld in a five-to-four decision but for widely diver-
gent reasons by a coalition of Justices. Two Justices thought that
Chief Justice Marshall’s 1804 decision should be overruled, but the
other seven Justices disagreed; however, three of the seven thought
the statute could be sustained under Congress’s power to enact leg-
islation for the inhabitants of the District of Columbia, but the re-
maining four plus the other two rejected this theory. The statute
was upheld because a total of five Justices voted to sustain it, al-
though of the two theories relied on, seven Justices rejected one
and six the other. The result, attributable to “conflicting minorities
in combination,” 1065 means that Hepburn v. Ellzey is still good law
insofar as it holds that the District of Columbia is not a state, but
is overruled insofar as it holds that District citizens may not use
federal diversity jurisdiction.1066
     Citizenship of Natural Persons.—For purposes of diversity
jurisdiction, state citizenship is determined by the concept of domi-
cile 1067 rather than of mere residence.1068 That is, while the Court’s
definition has varied throughout the cases,1069 a person is a citizen
of the state in which he has his true, fixed, and permanent home
