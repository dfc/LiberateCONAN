    Nonetheless, the Court has generally adhered to the early prec-
edent and would no doubt have developed the rule in any event, as
a logical application of the case and controversy doctrine. As Jus-
tice Jackson wrote when the Court refused to review an order of
the Civil Aeronautics Board, which in effect was a mere recommen-
dation to the President for his final action: “To revise or review an
administrative decision which has only the force of a recommenda-
tion to the President would be to render an advisory opinion in its
most obnoxious form—advice that the President has not asked, ten-
dered at the demand of a private litigant, on a subject concededly
within the President’s exclusive, ultimate control. This Court early
and wisely determined that it would not give advisory opinions even
when asked by the Chief Executive. It has also been the firm and
unvarying practice of Constitutional Courts to render no judg-
ments not binding and conclusive on the parties and none that are
subject to later review or alteration by administrative action.” 510
The Court’s early refusal to render advisory opinions has discour-
aged direct requests for advice so that the advisory opinion has ap-
peared only collaterally in cases where there was a lack of adverse
parties,511 or where the judgment of the Court was subject to later
review or action by the executive or legislative branches of govern-
ment,512 or where the issues involved were abstract or contin-
gent.513
    Declaratory Judgments.—Rigid emphasis upon such ele-
ments of judicial power as finality of judgment and award of execu-
tion coupled with equally rigid emphasis upon adverse parties and
real interests as essential elements of a case and controversy cre-
