Court of Admiralty. After independence, the states established ad-
miralty courts, from which at a later date appeals could be taken
to a court of appeals set up by Congress under the Articles of Con-
federation.850 Since one of the objectives of the Philadelphia Conven-
tion was the promotion of commerce through removal of obstacles
occasioned by the diverse local rules of the states, it was only logi-
cal that it should contribute to the development of a uniform body
of maritime law by establishing a system of federal courts and grant-
ing to these tribunals jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime cases.851
     The Constitution uses the terms “admiralty and maritime juris-
diction” without defining them. Though closely related, the words
are not synonyms. In England the word “maritime” referred to the
cases arising upon the high seas, whereas “admiralty” meant pri-
marily cases of a local nature involving police regulations of ship-
ping, harbors, fishing, and the like. A long struggle between the ad-
miralty and common law courts had, however, in the course of time
resulted in a considerable curtailment of English admiralty jurisdic-
tion. A much broader conception of admiralty and maritime jurisdic-
tion existed in the United States at the time of the framing of the
Constitution than in the Mother Country.852 At the very beginning
of government under the Constitution, Congress conferred on the
federal district courts exclusive original cognizance “of all civil causes
of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures un-
der laws of impost, navigation or trade of the United States, where
the seizures are made, on waters which are navigable from the sea
by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, within their respective dis-
tricts as well as upon the high seas; saving to suitors, in all cases,
the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is com-
petent to give it . . . .” 853 This broad legislative interpretation of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction soon won the approval of the
federal circuit courts, which ruled that the extent of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction was not to be determined by English law but

    851  The records of the Convention do not shed light on the Framers’ views about
admiralty. The present clause was contained in the draft of the Committee on De-
tail. 2 M. Farrand, supra at 186–187. None of the plans presented to the Conven-
tion, with the exception of an apparently authentic Charles Pinckney plan, 3 id. at
601–04, 608, had mentioned an admiralty jurisdiction in national courts. See Putnam,
How the Federal Courts Were Given Admiralty Jurisdiction, 10 CORNELL L.Q. 460 (1925).

(No. 3776) (C.C.D. Mass 1815), Justice Story delivered a powerful historical and jur-
isprudential argument against the then-restrictive English system. See also Waring
