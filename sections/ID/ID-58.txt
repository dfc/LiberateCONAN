If a decree was previously issued without regard to the standards
now imposed, the defendant or intervenor is entitled to move to va-
cate it. No prospective relief is to last longer than two years if any
party or intervenor so moves. Finally, a previously issued decree
that does not conform to the new standards imposed by the Act is
subject to termination upon the motion of the defendant or an in-
tervenor. After a short period (30 or 60 days, depending on whether
there is “good cause” for a 30-day extension), such a motion oper-
ates as an automatic stay of the prior decree pending the court’s
decision on the merits. The Court upheld the termination and auto-
matic stay provisions in Miller v. French,311 rejecting the conten-
tion that the automatic stay provision offends separation of powers
principles by legislative revision of a final judgment. Rather, Con-
gress merely established new standards for the enforcement of pro-
spective relief, and the automatic stay provision “helps to imple-
ment the change in the law.” 312 A number of constitutional challenges
can be expected respecting Congress’s power to limit federal judi-
cial authority to remedy constitutional violations.
    All of these restrictions have been sustained by the Supreme
Court as constitutional and applied with varying degrees of thor-
oughness. The Court has made exceptions to the application of the
prohibition against the stay of proceedings in state courts,313 but it
has on the whole adhered to the statute. The exceptions raise no
constitutional issues, and the tendency has been alternately to con-
tract and to expand the scope of the exceptions.314
    In Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering,315 the Supreme Court
placed a narrow construction upon the labor provisions of the Clay-
ton Act and thereby contributed in part to the more extensive re-
striction by Congress on the use of injunctions in labor disputes in
the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932, which has not only been de-
clared constitutional 316 but has been applied liberally 317 and in such
a manner as to repudiate the notion of an inherent power to issue
injunctions contrary to statutory provisions.
