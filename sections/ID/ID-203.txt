     Although it seems clear that Erie applies in nondiversity cases
in which the source of the right sued upon is state law,1125 it is
equally clear that Erie is not applicable always in diversity cases
whether the nature of the issue be substantive or procedural. Thus,
it may be that there is an overriding federal interest which com-
pels national uniformity of rules, such as a case in which the issue
is the appropriate rule for determining the liability of a bank which
had guaranteed a forged federal check,1126 in which the issue is the
appropriate rule for determining whether a tortfeasor is liable to
the United States for hospitalization of a soldier and loss of his ser-
vices 1127 and in which the issue is the appropriate rule for deter-
mining the validity of a defense raised by a federal officer sued for
having libeled one in the course of his official duties.1128 In such
cases, when the issue is found to be controlled by federal law, com-
mon or otherwise, the result is binding on state courts as well as
on federal.1129 Despite, then, Justice Brandeis’ assurance that there
is no “federal general common law,” there is a common law existing
and developing in the federal courts, even in diversity cases, which
will sometimes control decision.1130

1956). The contrary view was implied in Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. 648, 651
(1953), and by Justice Jackson in D’Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447,

     1127 United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301 (1947). Federal law applies

in maritime tort cases brought on the “law side” of the federal courts in diversity
cases. Pope & Talbot v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406 (1953).
     1128 Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593 (1959). Matters concerned with our foreign

relations also are governed by federal law in diversity. Banco Nacional de Cuba v.
Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964). Federal common law also governs a government con-
tractor defense in certain cases. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500
(1988).
     1129 Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663 (1962); Yiatchos v. Yiatchos, 376 U.S. 306 (1964).
     1130 The quoted Brandeis phrase is in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S.

64, 78 (1938). On the same day Erie was decided, the Court, in an opinion by Jus-
tice Brandeis, held that the issue of apportionment of the waters of an interstate
stream between two states “is a question of ‘federal common law.’ ” Hinderlider v.
La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.S. 92, 110 (1938). On the matter,
see Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91 (1972).
