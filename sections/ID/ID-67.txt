power to assure that the federal courts will not intrude into areas
committed to the other branches of government. Justiciability is the
term of art employed to give expression to this dual limitation placed
upon federal courts by the case and controversy doctrine.” 355 Jus-
tice Frankfurter perhaps best captured the flavor of the “case” and
“controversy” requirement by noting that it takes the “expert feel
of lawyers” often to note it.356
    From these quotations may be isolated several factors which,
in one degree or another, go to make up a “case” and “controversy.”

Adverse Litigants
     The presence of adverse litigants with real interests to contend
for is a standard which has been stressed in numerous cases,357 and
the requirement implicates a number of complementary factors mak-
ing up a justiciable suit. The requirement was one of the decisive
factors, if not the decisive one, in Muskrat v. United States,358 in
which the Court struck down a statute authorizing certain named
Indians to bring a test suit against the United States to determine
the validity of a law affecting the allocation of Indian lands. Attor-
ney’s fees of both sides were to be paid out of tribal funds depos-
ited in the United States Treasury. “The judicial power,” said the
Court, “. . . is the right to determine actual controversies arising
between adverse litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper juris-
diction. . . . It is true the United States is made a defendant to
this action, but it has no interest adverse to the claimants. The ob-
ject is not to assert a property right as against the government, or
to demand compensation for alleged wrongs because of action upon
its part. The whole purpose of the law is to determine the constitu-
tional validity of this class of legislation, in a suit not arising be-
tween parties concerning a property right necessarily involved in
the decision in question, but in a proceeding against the govern-
