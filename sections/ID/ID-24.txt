would necessarily presage the settling of the law.110 But the breadth
of the various opinions not only left unclear the degree of discre-
tion left in Congress to restructure the bankruptcy courts, but also
placed in issue the constitutionality of other legislative efforts to
establish adjudicative systems outside a scheme involving the cre-
ation of life-tenured judges.111
     Congress responded to Marathon by enactment of the Bank-
ruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984.112 Bank-
ruptcy courts were maintained as Article I entities, and overall their
powers as courts were not notably diminished. However, Congress
did establish a division between “core proceedings,” which could be
heard and determined by bankruptcy courts, subject to lenient re-
view, and other proceedings, which, though initially heard and de-
cided by bankruptcy courts, could be reviewed de novo in the dis-
trict court at the behest of any party, unless the parties had consented
to bankruptcy-court jurisdiction in the same manner as core pro-
ceedings. A safety valve was included, permitting the district court
to withdraw any proceeding from the bankruptcy court on cause
shown.113
    Notice, however, that in Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg 114 the
Court, evaluating the related issue of when a jury trial is required
under the Seventh Amendment,115 found that a cause of action to
avoid a fraudulent money transfer was founded on state law, and,
although denominated a core proceeding by Congress, was actually
a private right. Similarly, the Court in Stern v. Marshall 116 held
that a counterclaim of tortuous interference with a gift, although
made during a bankruptcy proceeding and statutorily deemed a core
proceeding, was a state common law claim that did not fall under
any of the public rights exceptions.117

     110 Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U.S. 438 (1929), was, after all, a unanimous

opinion and did not long survive.
     111 In particular, the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, under which judges may

refer certain pretrial motions and the trial of certain matters to persons appointed
to a specific term, was threatened. Pub. L. 90–578, 82 Stat. 1108, as amended, 28

     117 The Court noted that the claim “. . . is not a matter that can be pursued

only by grace of the other branches . . . or one that ‘historically could have been
determined exclusively by’ those branches . . . . It does not ‘depend[] on the will of
Congress’s . . . ; Congress has nothing to do with it. [It] . . . does not flow from a
federal statutory scheme . . . . [And it] is not ‘completely dependent upon’ adjudica-
tion of a claim created by federal law . . . . ” 564 U.S. ___, No. 10–179, slip op. at
