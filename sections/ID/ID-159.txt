usages of that country.” 859 “The general system of maritime law which
was familiar to the lawyers and statesmen of the country when the
Constitution was adopted, was most certainly intended and re-
ferred to when it was declared in that instrument that the judicial
power of the United States shall extend ‘to all cases of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction.’ But by what criterion are we to ascer-
tain the precise limits of the law thus adopted? The Constitution
does not define it . . . .”
     “One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must
have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating
uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been
the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under
the disposal and regulation of the several States, as that would have
defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution
aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the inter-
course of the States with each other or with foreign states.” 860
     “It cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution con-
templated that the law should forever remain unalterable. Con-
gress undoubtedly has authority under the commercial power, if no
other, to introduce such changes as are likely to be needed.” 861 That
Congress’s power to enact substantive maritime law was conferred
by the Commerce Clause was assumed in numerous opinions,862 but
later opinions by Justice Bradley firmly established that the source
of power was the admiralty grant itself, as supplemented by the
second prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause.863 Thus, “[a]s the
Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States to ‘all
cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,’ and as this jurisdic-
tion is held to be exclusive, the power of legislation on the same
subject must necessarily be in the national legislature and not in
the state legislatures.” 864 Rejecting an attack on a maritime stat-
ute as an infringement of intrastate commerce, Justice Bradley wrote:
“It is unnecessary to invoke the power given the Congress to regu-
late commerce in order to find authority to pass the law in ques-
tion. The act was passed in amendment of the maritime law of the
    859  88 U.S. at 572.
    860  88 U.S. at 574–75.
     861 88 U.S. at 577.

Transp. Co., 65 U.S. (24 How.) 1, 39 (1861); Providence & N.Y. S.S. Co. v. Hill Mfg.

to Congress to enact laws to carry into execution the powers vested in other depart-
ments of the Federal Government. See Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum,
293 U.S. 21, 42 (1934).
