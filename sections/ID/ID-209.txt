ited and manifestly to be sparingly exercised, and should not be
expanded by construction.” 1165 Exercise of its original jurisdiction
is not obligatory on the Court but discretionary, to be determined
on a case-by-case basis on grounds of practical necessity.1166 It is to
be honored “only in appropriate cases. And the question of what is
appropriate concerns of course the seriousness and dignity of the
claim; yet beyond that it necessarily involves the availability of an-
other forum where there is jurisdiction over the named parties, where
the issues tendered may be litigated, and where appropriate relief
may be had. We incline to a sparing use of our original jurisdiction
so that our increasing duties with the appellate docket will not suf-
fer.” 1167 But where claims are of sufficient “seriousness and dig-
nity,” in which resolution by the judiciary is of substantial concern,
the Court will hear them.1168
    POWER OF CONGRESS TO CONTROL THE FEDERAL
                    COURTS

The Theory of Plenary Congressional Control
    Unlike its original jurisdiction, the appellate jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court is subject to “exceptions and regulations” pre-
scribed by Congress, and the jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts
is subject to congressional prescription. Additionally, Congress has
power to regulate modes and practices of proceeding on the part of
the inferior federal courts. Whether there are limitations to the ex-
ercise of these congressional powers, and what the limitations may
be, are matters that have vexed scholarly and judicial interpreta-
      1165 California v. Southern Pacific Co., 157 U.S. 229, 261 (1895). Indeed, the use

of the word “sparingly” in this context is all but ubiquitous. E.g., Wyoming v. Okla-
homa, 502 U.S. 437, 450 (1992); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 739 (1981);
United States v. Nevada, 412 U.S. 534, 538 (1973).
      1166 Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U.S. 554, 570 (1983).
      1167 Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91, 93–94 (1972). In this case, and in

Washington v. General Motors Corp., 406 U.S. 109 (1972), and Ohio v. Wyandotte
Chemicals Corp., 401 U.S. 493 (1971), the Court declined to permit adjudication of
environmental pollution cases manifestly within its original jurisdiction because the
nature of the cases required the resolution of complex, novel, and technical factual
questions not suitable for resolution at the Court’s level as a matter of initial deci-
sion, but which could be brought in the lower federal courts. Not all such cases,
however, were barred. Vermont v. New York, 406 U.S. 186 (1972) (granting leave to
file complaint). In other instances, notably involving “political questions,” cf. Massa-
chusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923), the Court has simply refused permission
for parties to file bills of complaint without hearing them on the issue or producing
an opinion. E.g., Massachusetts v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (1970) (constitutionality of
United States action in Indochina); Delaware v. New York, 385 U.S. 895 (1966) (con-
stitutionality of electoral college under one-man, one-vote rule).
      1168 Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 451 (1982). The principles are the same

whether the Court’s jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent. Texas v. New Mexico,
462 U.S. 554 (1983); California v. West Virginia, 454 U.S. 1027 (1981); Arizona v.
New Mexico, 425 U.S. 794 (1976).
