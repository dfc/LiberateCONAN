ment of such fees in that situation, but it remanded for consider-
ation of sanctions under both a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and
the trial court’s inherent powers, subject to a finding of bad faith.248
But bad faith is not always required for the exercise of some inher-
ent powers. Thus, courts may dismiss an action for an unexplained
failure of the moving party to prosecute it.249

Power to Issue Writs: The Act of 1789
     From the beginning of government under the Constitution of
1789, Congress has assumed, under the Necessary and Proper Clause,
its power to establish inferior courts, its power to regulate the ju-
risdiction of federal courts, and its power to regulate the issuance
of writs.250 Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the
Supreme Court “to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts,
when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,
and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and
usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding office,
under the authority of the United States.” 251 Section 14 provided
that all “courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs
of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially pro-
vided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their
respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages
of law.” 252
    Although the Act of 1789 left the power over writs subject largely
to the common law, it is significant as a reflection of the belief, in
which the courts have on the whole concurred, that an act of Con-
gress is necessary to confer judicial power to issue writs.253 Whether
Article III itself is an independent source of the power of federal
courts to fashion equitable remedies for constitutional violations or
whether such remedies must fit within congressionally authorized

such authority not being granted by the relevant statutes).
