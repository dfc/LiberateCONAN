in industries vital to public health, as distinguished from the pri-
vate rights of labor and management, was held not to alter the ad-
versary (“case or controversy”) nature of the litigation instituted by
the United States as the guardian of the aforementioned rights.954
Also, by reason of the highest public interest in the fulfillment of
all constitutional guarantees, “including those that bear . . . di-
rectly on private rights, . . . it [is] perfectly competent for Con-
gress to authorize the United States to be the guardian of that pub-
lic interest in a suit for injunctive relief.” 955
    Suits Against States.—Controversies to which the United States
is a party include suits brought against states as party defendants.
The first such suit occurred in United States v. North Carolina,956
which was an action by the United States to recover upon bonds
issued by North Carolina. Although no question of jurisdiction was
raised, in deciding the case on its merits in favor of the state, the
Court tacitly assumed that it had jurisdiction of such cases. The
issue of jurisdiction was directly raised by Texas a few years later
in a bill in equity brought by the United States to determine the
boundary between Texas and the Territory of Oklahoma, and the
Court sustained its jurisdiction over strong arguments by Texas to
the effect that it could not be sued by the United States without its
consent and that the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction did not
extend to cases to which the United States is a party.957 Stressing
the inclusion within the judicial power of cases to which the United
States and a state are parties, the elder Justice Harlan pointed out
that the Constitution made no exception of suits brought by the United
States. In effect, therefore, consent to be sued by the United States
“was given by Texas when admitted to the Union upon an equal
footing in all respects with the other States.” 958
    Suits brought by the United States have, however, been infre-
quent. All of them have arisen since 1889, and they have become
somewhat more common since 1926. That year the Supreme Court
decided a dispute between the United States and Minnesota over
     954 United Steelworkers v. United States, 361 U.S. 39, 43–44 (1960), citing In re

Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895).
     955 United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 27 (1960), upholding jurisdiction of the

federal court over an action to enjoin state officials from discriminating against African-
American citizens seeking to vote in state elections. See also Oregon v. Mitchell, 400
U.S. 112 (1970), in which two of the four cases considered were actions by the United
States to enjoin state compliance with the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970.
     956 136 U.S. 211 (1890).
     957 United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621 (1892).
     958 143 U.S. at 642–46. This suit, it may be noted, was specifically authorized

by the Act of Congress of May 2, 1890, providing for a temporary government for
the Oklahoma territory to determine the ownership of Greer County. 26 Stat. 81,
92, § 25. See also United States v. Louisiana, 339 U.S. 699, 701–02 (1950).
