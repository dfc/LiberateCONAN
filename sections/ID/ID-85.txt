    For instance, under circumstances where injured parties would
be likely to be unable to assert their rights, many cases allow stand-
ing to third parties who can demonstrate a requisite degree of in-
jury to themselves. Thus, in Barrows v. Jackson,444 a white defen-
dant who was being sued for damages for breach of a restrictive
covenant directed against African Americans—and therefore able to
show injury in liability for damages—was held to have standing to
assert the rights of the class of persons whose constitutional rights
were infringed.445 Similarly, the Court has permitted defendants who
have been convicted under state law—giving them the requisite in-
jury—to assert the rights of those persons not before the Court whose
rights would be adversely affected through enforcement of the law
in question.446 In fact, the Court has permitted persons who would
be subject to future prosecution or future legal action—thus satisfy-
ing the injury requirement—to represent the rights of third parties
with whom the challenged law has interfered with a relation-
ship.447
    It is also possible, of course, that one’s own rights can be af-
fected by action directed at someone from another group.448 A sub-

    445  See also Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917) (white plaintiff suing for
specific performance of a contract to convey property to a black had standing to con-
test constitutionality of ordinance barring sale of property to “colored” people, inas-
much as black defendant was relying on ordinance as his defense); Sullivan v. Little
Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229 (1969) (white assignor of membership in discriminatory
private club could raise rights of black assignee in seeking injunction against expul-
sion from club).
     446 E.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (persons convicted of pre-

scribing contraceptives for married persons and as accessories to crime of using con-
traceptives have standing to raise constitutional rights of patients with whom they
had a professional relationship; although use of contraceptives was a crime, it was
doubtful any married couple would be prosecuted so that they could challenge the
statute); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (advocate of contraception con-
victed of giving device to unmarried woman had standing to assert rights of unmar-
ried persons denied access; unmarried persons were not subject to prosecution and
were thus impaired in their ability to gain a forum to assert their rights).
     447 E.g., Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188–189 (1973) (doctors have standing to

challenge abortion statute since it operates directly against them and they should
not have to await criminal prosecution to challenge it); Planned Parenthood v. Danforth,
428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (same); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192–197 (1976) (li-
censed beer distributor could contest sex discriminatory alcohol laws because it op-
erated on him, he suffered injury in fact, and was “obvious claimant” to raise issue);
Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U.S. 678, 682–84 (1977) (vendor of contracep-
tives had standing to bring action to challenge law limiting distribution). Older cases
support the proposition. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925);
Bantam Books v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58 (1963).
     448 Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474 (1990) (white defendant had standing to raise

a Sixth Amendment challenge to exclusion of blacks from his jury, since defendant
had a right to a jury comprised of a fair cross section of the community). The Court
has expanded the rights of non-minority defendants to challenge the exclusion of
