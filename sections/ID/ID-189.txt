tage. “Georgia as a representative of the public is complaining of a
wrong which, if proven, limits the opportunities of her people, shack-
les her industries, retards her development, and relegates her to
an inferior economic position among her sister States. These are
matters of grave public concern in which Georgia has an interest
apart from that of particular individuals who may be affected. Geor-
gia’s interest is not remote; it is immediate. If we denied Georgia
as parens patriae the right to invoke the original jurisdiction of the
Court in a matter of that gravity, we would whittle the concept of
justiciability down to the stature of minor or conventional contro-
versies. There is no warrant for such a restriction.” 1045
    The continuing vitality of this case is in some doubt, as the Court
has limited it in a similar case.1046 But the ability of states to act
as parens patriae for their citizens in environmental pollution cases
seems established, although as a matter of the Supreme Court’s origi-
nal jurisdiction such suits are not in favor.1047
    One clear limitation had seemed to be solidly established until
later litigation cast doubt on its foundation. It is no part of a state’s
“duty or power,” said the Court in Massachusetts v. Mellon,1048 “to
enforce [its citizens’] rights in respect to their relations with the
Federal Government. In that field, it is the United States and not
the state that represents them as parens patriae when such repre-
sentation becomes appropriate; and to the former, and not to the
latter, they must look for such protective measures as flow from that

     1045 Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 468 (1945). Chief Justice Stone

and Justices Roberts, Frankfurter, and Jackson dissented.
     1046 In Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251 (1972), the Court, five-to-two,

held that the state could not maintain an action for damages parens patriae under
the Clayton Act and limited the previous case to instances in which injunctive relief
is sought. Hawaii had brought its action in federal district court. The result in Ha-
waii was altered by Pub. L. 94–435, 90 Stat. 1383 (1976), 15 U.S.C. §§ 15c et seq.,
but the decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), reduced the
significance of the law.
     1047 Most of the cases, but see Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U.S. 230

(1907), concern suits by one state against another. Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. 208
(1901); New York v. New Jersey, 256 U.S. 296 (1921); North Dakota v. Minnesota,
263 U.S. 365 (1923). Although recognizing that original jurisdiction exists when a
state sues a political subdivision of another state or a private party as parens patriae
for its citizens and on its own proprietary interests to abate environmental pollu-
tion, the Court has held that, because of the technical complexities of the issues
and the inconvenience of adjudicating them on its original docket, the cases should
be brought in federal district court under federal question jurisdiction founded on
the federal common law. Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91 (1972); Washing-
ton v. General Motors Corp., 406 U.S. 109 (1972). The Court had earlier thought the
cases must be brought in state court. Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U.S.
493 (1971).
     1048 262 U.S. 447, 486 (1923).
