States have real and substantial interests in the River that must
be reconciled as best they may be.” 1005
    Other types of interstate disputes of which the Court has taken
jurisdiction include suits by a state as the donee of the bonds of
another to collect thereon,1006 by Virginia against West Virginia to
determine the proportion of the public debt of the original State of
Virginia which the latter owed the former,1007 by Arkansas to en-
join Texas from interfering with the performance of a contract by a
Texas foundation to contribute to the construction of a new hospi-
tal in the medical center of the University of Arkansas,1008 of one
state against another to enforce a contract between the two,1009 of
a suit in equity between states for the determination of a dece-
dent’s domicile for inheritance tax purposes,1010 and of a suit by two
states to restrain a third from enforcing a natural gas measure that
purported to restrict the interstate flow of natural gas from the state
in the event of a shortage.1011
    In Texas v. New Jersey,1012 the Court adjudicated a multistate
dispute about which state should be allowed to escheat intangible
property consisting of uncollected small debts held by a corpora-
tion. Emphasizing that the states could not constitutionally pro-
vide a rule of settlement and that no federal statute governed the
     1005 283 U.S. at 342. See also Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589 (1945); Idaho

ex rel. Evans v. Oregon, 462 U.S. 1017 (1983). In Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.,
401 U.S. 493 (1971), the Court held it had jurisdiction of a suit by a state against
citizens of other states to abate a nuisance allegedly caused by the dumping of mer-
cury into streams that ultimately run into Lake Erie, but it declined to permit the
filing because the presence of complex scientific issues made the case more appropri-
ate for first resolution in a district court. See also Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U.S.
554 (1983); Nevada v. United States, 463 U.S. 110 (1983).
     1006 South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U.S. 286 (1904).
     1007 Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. 1 (1911).
     1008 Arkansas v. Texas, 346 U.S. 368 (1953).
     1009 Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U.S. 163 (1930).
     1010 Texas v. Florida, 306 U.S. 398 (1939). In California v. Texas, 437 U.S. 601

(1978), the Court denied a state leave to file an original action against another state
to determine the contested domicile of a decedent for death tax purposes, with sev-
eral Justices of the view that Texas v. Florida had either been wrongly decided or
was questionable. But, after determining that an interpleader action by the admin-
istrator of the estate for a determination of domicile was barred by the Eleventh
Amendment, Cory v. White, 457 U.S. 85 (1982), the Court over dissent permitted
filing of the original action. California v. Texas, 457 U.S. 164 (1982).
     1011 Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553 (1923). The Court, in Mary-

land v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725 (1981), over strong dissent, relied on this case in
permitting suit contesting a tax imposed on natural gas, the incidence of which fell
on the suing state’s consuming citizens. And, in Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S.
437 (1992), the Court permitted a state to sue another to contest a law requiring
that all in-state utilities burn a mixture containing at least 10% in-state coal, the
plaintiff state having previously supplied 100% of the coal to those utilities and thus
suffering a loss of coal-severance tax revenues.
