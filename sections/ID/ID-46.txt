condemned here as either necessary or helpful to a successful de-
fense. That such clients seem to have thought these tactics neces-
sary is likely to contribute to the bar’s reluctance to appear for them
rather more than fear of contempt. But that there may be no mis-
understanding, we make clear that this Court, if its aid be needed,
will unhesitatingly protect counsel in fearless, vigorous and effec-
tive performance of every duty pertaining to the office of the advo-
cate on behalf of any person whatsoever. But it will not equate con-
tempt with courage or insults with independence. It will also protect
the processes of orderly trial, which is the supreme object of the
lawyer’s calling.” 230
     In Offutt v. United States,231 acting under its supervisory pow-
ers over the lower federal courts, the Court set aside a criminal
contempt conviction imposed on a lawyer after a trial marked by
highly personal recriminations between the trial judge and the law-
yer. In a situation in which the record revealed that the contuma-
cious conduct was the product of both lack of self-restraint on the
part of the contemnor and a reaction to the excessive zeal and per-
sonal animosity of the trial judge, the majority felt that any con-
tempt trial must be held before another judge. This holding, that
when a judge becomes personally embroiled in the controversy with
an accused he must defer trial of his contempt citation to another
judge, which was founded on the Court’s supervisory powers, was
constitutionalized in Mayberry v. Pennsylvania,232 in which a defen-
dant acting as his own counsel engaged in quite personal abuse of
the trial judge. The Court appeared to leave open the option of the
trial judge to act immediately and summarily to quell contempt by
citing and convicting an offender, thus empowering the judge to keep
the trial going,233 but if he should wait until the conclusion of the
trial he must defer to another judge.
    Contempt by Disobedience of Orders.—Disobedience of in-
junctive orders, particularly in labor disputes, has been a fruitful
source of cases dealing with contempt of court. In United States v.

    230  343 U.S. at 11, 13–14.
    231  348 U.S. 11 (1954).
     232 400 U.S. 455 (1971). See also Johnson v. Mississippi, 403 U.S. 212 (1971);

Holt v. Virginia, 381 U.S. 131 (1965). Even in the absence of a personal attack on a
judge that would tend to impair his detachment, the judge may still be required to
excuse himself and turn a citation for contempt over to another judge if the re-
sponse to the alleged misconduct in his courtroom partakes of the character of “marked
personal feelings” being abraded on both sides, so that it is likely the judge has felt
a “sting” sufficient to impair his objectivity. Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488 (1974).
     233 400 U.S. at 463. See Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337 (1970), in which the Court

affirmed that summary contempt or expulsion may be used to keep a trial going.
