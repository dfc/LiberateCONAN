    Not until 1913 did Congress again exercise its power to abolish
a federal court, this time the unfortunate Commerce Court, which
had disappointed the expectations of most of its friends.28 But this
time Congress provided for the redistribution of the Commerce Court
judges among the circuit courts as well as a transfer of its jurisdic-
tion to the district courts.

Compensation
    Diminution of Salaries.—“The Compensation Clause has its
roots in the longstanding Anglo-American tradition of an indepen-
dent Judiciary. A Judiciary free from control by the Executive and
the Legislature is essential if there is a right to have claims de-
cided by judges who are free from potential domination by other
branches of government.” 29 Thus, once a salary figure has gone into
effect, Congress may not reduce it nor rescind any part of an in-
crease, although prior to the time of its effectiveness Congress may
repeal a promised increase. This latter holding was rendered in the
context of a statutory salary plan for all federal officers and employ-
ees under which increases went automatically into effect on a speci-
fied date. Four years running, Congress interdicted the pay in-
creases, but in two instances the increases had become effective,
raising the barrier of this clause.30
    Also implicating this clause was a Depression-era appropria-
tions act reducing “the salaries and retired pay of all judges (ex-
cept judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution,
be diminished during their continuance in office),” by a fixed amount.
Although this provision presented no constitutional questions, it re-
quired an interpretation as to which judges were excepted. Judges
in the District of Columbia were held protected by Article III,31 but
the salaries of the judges of the Court of Claims, a legislative court,
were held subject to the reduction.32
     28 The Court was created by the Act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 539, and re-

pealed by the Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219. See Frankfurter & Landis,
supra at 153–174; W. Carpenter, supra at 78–94.
     29 United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 217–18 (1980). Hamilton, writing in THE

FEDERALIST, No. 79 (J. Cooke ed., 1961), 531, emphasized that “[i]n the general course
of human nature, a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his
will.”
     30 United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 224–30 (1980). In one year, the increase

took effect on October 1, although the President signed the bill reducing the amount
during the day of October 1. The Court held that the increase had gone into effect
by the time the reduction was signed. Will is also authority for the proposition that
a general, nondiscriminatory reduction, affecting judges but not aimed solely at them,
is covered by the clause. Id. at 226.
