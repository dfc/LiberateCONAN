evant state law is settled,1277 or where it is clear that the state stat-
ute or action challenged is unconstitutional no matter how the state
court construes state law.1278 Federal jurisdiction is not ousted by
abstention; rather it is postponed.1279 Federal-state tensions would
be ameliorated through federal-court deference to the concept that
state courts are as adequate a protector of constitutional liberties
as the federal courts and through the minimization of the likeli-
hood that state programs would be thwarted by federal interces-
sion. Federal courts would benefit because time and effort would
not be expended in decision of difficult constitutional issues which
might not require decision.1280
    During the 1960s, the abstention doctrine was in disfavor with
the Supreme Court, suffering rejection in numerous cases, most of




is unsettled. Meredith v. City of Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228 (1943); County of Al-
legheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185 (1959); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v.
City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25 (1959). See also Clay v. Sun Insurance Office Ltd.,
363 U.S. 207 (1960). Also, although pendency of an action in state court will not
ordinarily cause a federal court to abstain, there are “exceptional” circumstances in
which it should. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S.
800 (1976); Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., 437 U.S. 655 (1978); Arizona v. San
Carlos Apache Tribe, 463 U.S. 545 (1983). But, in Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,
517 U.S. 706 (1996), an exercise in Burford abstention, the Court held that federal
courts have power to dismiss or remand cases based on abstention principles only
where relief being sought is equitable or otherwise discretionary but may not do so
in common-law actions for damages.
     1277 City of Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 357 U.S. 77 (1958); Zwickler v.

Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 249–51 (1967). See Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l. Union,
442 U.S. 289, 306 (1979) (quoting Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534–35 (1965)).
     1278 Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534–35 (1965); Babbitt v. United Farm

Workers Nat’l., 442 U.S. 289, 305–12 (1979). Abstention is not proper simply to af-
ford a state court the opportunity to hold that a state law violates the federal Con-
stitution. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434
U.S. 374, 379 n.5 (1978); Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U.S. 265, 271 n.4
(1977); City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987) (“A federal court may not prop-
erly ask a state court if it would care in effect to rewrite a statute”). But if the
statute is clear and there is a reasonable possibility that the state court would find
it in violation of a distinct or specialized state constitutional provision, abstention
may be proper, Harris County Comm’rs Court v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77 (1975); Reetz v.
Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82 (1970), although not if the state and federal constitutional
provisions are alike. Examining Bd. v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 598 (1976).
     1279 American Trial Lawyers Ass’n v. New Jersey Supreme Court, 409 U.S. 467,

469 (1973); Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167 (1959). Dismissal may be necessary if
the state court will not accept jurisdiction while the case is pending in federal court.
Harris County Comm’rs v. Moore, 420 U.S. 77, 88 n.14 (1975).
     1280 E.g., Spector Motor Service v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101 (1944); Louisiana

Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25 (1959); Harrison v. NAACP,
360 U.S. 167 (1959).
