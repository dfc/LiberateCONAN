and principal establishment and to which he intends to return when-
ever he is absent from it.1070 Acts may disclose intention more clearly
and decisively than declarations.1071 One may change his domicile
in an instant by taking up residence in the new place and by intend-
ing to remain there indefinitely and one may obtain the benefit of
diversity jurisdiction by so changing for that reason alone,1072 pro-
vided the change is more than a temporary expedient.1073
    If the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of different states,
diversity jurisdiction exists regardless of the state in which suit is
brought.1074 Chief Justice Marshall early established that in multi-
party litigation, there must be complete diversity, that is, that no
party on one side could be a citizen of any state of which any party
on the other side was a citizen.1075 It has now apparently been de-
cided that this requirement flows from the statute on diversity rather
than from the constitutional grant and that therefore minimal di-
versity is sufficient.1076 The Court has also placed some issues be-
yond litigation in federal courts in diversity cases, apparently solely
on policy grounds.1077
    Citizenship of Corporations.—In Bank of the United States
v. Deveaux,1078 Chief Justice Marshall declared: “That invisible, in-
tangible, and artificial being, that mere legal entity, a corporation
aggregate, is certainly not a citizen; and consequently cannot sue
or be sued in the courts of the United States, unless the rights of

holding that congressional provision in the interpleader statute of minimal diver-
sity, 28 U.S.C. § 1335(a)(1), was valid, the Court said of Strawbridge, “Chief Justice
Marshall there purported to construe only ‘The words of the act of Congress,’ not
the Constitution itself. And in a variety of contexts this Court and the lower courts
have concluded that Article III poses no obstacle to the legislative extension of fed-
eral jurisdiction, founded on diversity, so long as any two adverse parties are not
co-citizens.” Of course, the diversity jurisdictional statute not having been changed,
complete diversity of citizenship, outside the interpleader situation, is still required.
In class actions, only the citizenship of the named representatives is considered and
other members of the class can be citizens of the same state as one or more of the
parties on the other side. Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U.S. 356 (1921);
Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 340 (1969).
     1077 In domestic relations cases and probate matters, the federal courts will not

act, though diversity exists. Barber v. Barber, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 582 (1858); Ex parte
Burrus, 136 U.S. 586 (1890); In re Broderick’s Will, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 503 (1875).
These cases merely enunciated the rule, without justifying it; when the Court squarely
faced the issue quite recently, it adhered to the rule, citing justifications. Ankenbrandt
v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689 (1992).
     1078 9 U.S. (5 Cr.) 61, 86 (1809).
