order to establish standing. The ‘injury in fact’ in an equal protec-
tion case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting
from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to ob-
tain the benefit.” 432 The association, therefore, established stand-
ing by alleging that its members were able and ready to bid on con-
tracts but that a discriminatory policy prevented them from doing
so on an equal basis.433
    Redressability can be present in an environmental “citizen suit”
even when the remedy is civil penalties payable to the govern-
ment. The civil penalties, the Court explained, “carried with them
a deterrent effect that made it likely, as opposed to merely specula-
tive, that the penalties would redress [plaintiffs’] injuries by abat-
ing current violations and preventing future ones.” 434
    Prudential Standing Rules.—Even when Article III constitu-
tional standing rules have been satisfied, the Court has held that
principles of prudence may counsel the judiciary to refuse to adju-
dicate some claims.435 The rule is “not meant to be especially de-
manding,” 436 and it is clear that the Court feels free to disregard
any of these prudential rules when it sees fit.437 Congress is also
free to legislate away prudential restraints and confer standing to
the extent permitted by Article III.438 The Court has identified three
      432 Northeastern Fla. Ch. of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jackson-

ville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). The Court derived the proposition from another set
of cases. Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346 (1970); Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957
(1982); Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 281 n.14 (1978).
      433 508 U.S. at 666. But see, in the context of ripeness, Reno v. Catholic Social

Services, Inc., 509 U.S. 43 (1993), in which the Court, over the dissent’s reliance on
Jacksonville, 509 U.S. at 81–82, denied the relevance of its distinction between en-
titlement to a benefit and equal treatment. Id. at 58 n.19.
      434 Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 187 (2000).
      435 Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99–100 (1979) (“a plain-

tiff may still lack standing under the prudential principles by which the judiciary
seeks to avoid deciding questions of broad social import where no individual rights
would be vindicated and to limit access to the federal courts to those litigants best
suited to assert a particular claim”).
      436 Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band Of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567

U.S. ___, No. 11–246, slip op. at 15 (2010).
      437 Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500–501 (1975); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190,

193–194 (1976).
      438 “Congress may grant an express right of action to persons who otherwise

would be barred by prudential standing rules. Of course, Art. III’s requirement re-
mains: the plaintiff still must allege a distinct and palpable injury to himself, even
if it is an injury shared by a large class of other possible litigants.” Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975). That is, the actual or threatened injury required may ex-
ist solely by virtue of “statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates
standing, even though no injury would exist without the statute.” Linda R.S. v. Rich-
ard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 n. 3 (1973); O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 493 n.2
(1974). Examples include United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669 (1973); Trafficante
v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205 (1972); Gladstone Realtors v. Village of
Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91 (1979). See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 8 n.4, 11–12
