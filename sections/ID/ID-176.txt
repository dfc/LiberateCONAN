ous subsequent cases, without discussion or examination.967 In-
deed, it was not until United States v. Lee 968 that the Court exam-
ined the rule and the reasons for it, and limited its application
accordingly.
    Because suits against the United States can be maintained only
by congressional consent, it follows that they can be brought only
in the manner prescribed by Congress and subject to the restric-
tions imposed.969 As only Congress may waive the immunity of the
United States from liability, officers of the United States are power-
less either to waive such immunity or to confer jurisdiction on a
federal court.970 Even when authorized, suits may be brought only

     967 United States v. McLemore, 45 U.S. (4 How.) 286 (1846); Hill v. United States,

50 U.S. (9 How.) 386, 389 (1850); De Groot v. United States, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 419,
431 (1867); United States v. Eckford, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 484, 488 (1868); The Siren,
74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 152, 154 (1869); Nichols v. United States, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 122,
126 (1869); The Davis, 77 U.S. (10 Wall.) 15, 20 (1870); Carr v. United States, 98
U.S. 433, 437–439 (1879). It is also clear that the Federal Government, in the ab-
sence of its consent, is not liable in tort for the negligence of its agents or employ-
ees. Gibbons v. United States, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 269, 275 (1869); Peabody v. United
States, 231 U.S. 530, 539 (1913); Koekuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. United States,
260 U.S. 125, 127 (1922). The reason for such immunity, as stated by Justice Holmes
in Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U.S. 349, 353 (1907), is that “there can be no
legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right de-
pends.” See also The Western Maid, 257 U.S. 419, 433 (1922). As the Housing Act
does not purport to authorize suits against the United States as such, the question
is whether the Authority—which is clearly an agency of the United States—
partakes of this sovereign immunity. The answer must be sought in the intention of
the Congress. Sloan Shipyards v. United States Fleet Corp., 258 U.S. 549, 570 (1922);
Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, 295 U.S. 229, 231 (1935). This involves a consider-
ation of the extent to which other government-owned corporations have been held
liable for their wrongful acts. 39 Ops. Atty. Gen. 559, 562 (1938).
     968 106 U.S. 196 (1882).
     969 Lonergan v. United States, 303 U.S. 33 (1938). Waivers of immunity must

be express. Library of Congress v. Shaw, 461 U.S. 273 (1983) (Civil Rights Act pro-
vision that “the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person”
insufficient to waive immunity from awards of interest). The result in Shaw was
overturned by a specific waiver. Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102–166, 106 Stat.
1079, § 113, amending 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16. Immunity was waived, with limita-
tions, for contracts and takings claims in the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2). Im-
munity of the United States for the negligence of its employees was waived, again
with limitations, in the Federal Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671–2680.
Other waivers of sovereign immunity include Pub. L. 94–574, § 1, 90 Stat. 2721 (1976),
amending 5 U.S.C. § 702 (waiver for nonstatutory review in all cases save for suits
for money damages); Pub. L. 87–748, § 1(a), 76 Stat. 744 (1962), 28 U.S.C. § 1361
(giving district courts jurisdiction of mandamus actions to compel an officer or em-
ployee of the United States to perform a duty owed to plaintiff); Westfall Act, 102
Stat. 4563, 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d) (torts of federal employees acting officially), and the
Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. § 504, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (making United States
liable for awards of attorneys’ fees in some instances when it loses an administra-
tive proceeding or a lawsuit). See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994) (FSLIC’s “sue-
and-be-sued” clause waives sovereign immunity, but a Bivens implied cause of ac-
tion for constitutional torts cannot be used directly against FSLIC).
