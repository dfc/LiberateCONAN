ful to the economic or other well-being of it citizens.466 The state
must be more than a nominal party without a real interest of its
own, merely representing the interests of particular citizens who
cannot represent themselves; 467 it must articulate an interest apart
from those of private parties that partakes of a “quasi-sovereign in-
terest” in the health and well-being, both physical and economic, of
its residents in general, although there are suggestions that the re-
strictive definition grows out of the Court’s wish to constrain its
original jurisdiction and may not fit such suits brought in the lower
federal courts.468
    Standing of Members of Congress.—The lower federal courts,
principally the D.C. Circuit, developed a body of law governing the
standing of Members of Congress, as Members, to bring court ac-
tions, usually to challenge actions of the executive branch.469 When
the Supreme Court finally addressed the issue on the merits in 1997,
however, it severely curtailed Member standing.470 All agree that a
legislator “receives no special consideration in the standing in-

     466 Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439 (1945) (antitrust); Maryland v.

Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 737–739 (1981) (discriminatory state taxation of natural
gas shipped to out-of-state customers); Alfred L. Snapp & Son v. Puerto Rico ex rel.
Barez, 458 U.S. 592 (1982) (discrimination by growers against Puerto Rican mi-
grant workers and denial of Commonwealth’s opportunity to participate in federal
employment service laws).
     467 New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76 (1883); Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson

v. Cook, 304 U.S. 387 (1938); Oklahoma v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 220 U.S. 277 (1911);
North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U.S. 365, 376 (1923); Pennsylvania v. New Jersey,
426 U.S. 660 (1976).
     468 Alfred L. Snapp & Son v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607–08

(1982). Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, ar-
gued that the Court’s standards should apply only in original actions and not in
actions filed in federal district courts, where, they contended, the prerogative of a
state to bring suit on behalf of its citizens should be commensurate with the ability
of private organizations to do so. Id. at 610. The Court admitted that different con-
siderations might apply between original actions and district court suits. Id. at 603
n.12.
     469 Member standing has not fared well in other Circuits. Holtzman v. Schlesinger,

484 F.2d 1307 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 936 (1974); Harrington v. Schlesinger,
528 F.2d 455 (4th Cir. 1975).
     470 Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997). In Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 438

(1939), the Court had recognized that legislators can in some instances suffer an
injury in respect to the effectiveness of their votes that will confer standing. In Pressler
v. Blumenthal, 434 U.S. 1028 (1978), affg, 428 F. Supp. 302 (D.D.C. 1976) (three-
judge court), the Court affirmed a decision in which the lower court had found Mem-
ber standing but had then decided against the Member on the merits. The “unexplicated
affirmance” could have reflected disagreement with the lower court on standing or
agreement with it on the merits. Note Justice Rehnquist’s appended statement. Id.
In Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996 (1979), the Court vacated a decision, in which
the lower Court had found Member standing, and directed dismissal, but none of
the Justices who addressed the question of standing. The opportunity to consider
Member standing was strongly pressed in Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361 (1987), but
the expiration of the law in issue mooted the case.
