today, rather than as it existed in 1789.” 275 This statement, how-
ever, appears to be in tension with the theory of congressionally
defined habeas found in Bollman, unless one assumes that a ha-
beas right, once created, cannot be diminished. The Court, how-
ever, in reviewing provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act 276 that limited habeas, passed up an opportunity to de-
lineate Congress’s permissive authority over habeas, finding that none
of the limitations to the writ in that statute raised questions of con-
stitutional import.277
    For practical purposes, the issue appears to have been resolved
by Boumediene v. Bush,278 in which the Court held that Congress’s
attempt to eliminate all federal habeas jurisdiction over “enemy com-
batant” detainees held at Guantanamo Bay 279 violated the Suspen-
sion Clause. Although the Court did not explicitly identify whether
the underlying right to habeas that was at issue arose from stat-
ute, common law, or the Constitution itself, it did decline to infer
“too much” from the lack of historical examples of habeas being ex-
tended to enemy aliens held overseas.280 In Boumediene, the Court
instead emphasized a “functional” approach that considered the citi-
zenship and status of the detainee, the adequacy of the process through
which the status determination was made, the nature of the sites
where apprehension and detention took place, and any practical ob-
stacles inherent in resolving the prisoner’s entitlement to the writ.281
    In further determining that the procedures afforded to the de-
tainees to challenge their detention in court were not adequate sub-
stitutes for habeas, the Court noted the heightened due process con-
cerns when a detention is based principally on Executive Branch

289, 300–01 (2001) (leaving open the question of whether post-1789 legal develop-
ments are protected); Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372 (1977) (finding “no occasion”
to define the contours of constitutional limits on congressional modification of the
writ).

    279 In Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), the Court found that 28 U.S.C. § 2241,

the federal habeas statute, applied to these detainees. Congress then removed all
court jurisdiction over these detainees under the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005,
Pub. L. 109–148, § 1005(e)(1) (providing that “no court . . . shall have jurisdiction
to hear or consider . . . an application for . . . habeas corpus filed by . . . an alien
detained . . . at Guantanamo Bay).” After the Court decided in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,
548 U.S. 557 (2006), that the Detainee Treatment Act did not apply to detainees
whose cases were pending at the time of enactment, it was amended by the Mili-
tary Commissions Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109–366, to also apply to pending cases where
a detainee had been determined to be an enemy combatant.
