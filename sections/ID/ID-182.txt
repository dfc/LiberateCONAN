    Modern Types of Suits Between States.—Beginning with Mis-
souri v. Illinois & Chicago District,1001 which sustained jurisdiction
to entertain an injunction suit to restrain the discharge of sewage
into the Mississippi River, water rights, the use of water resources,
and the like, have become an increasing source of suits between
states. Such suits have been especially frequent in the western
states,1002 where water is even more of a treasure than elsewhere,
but they have not been confined to any one region. In Kansas v.
Colorado,1003 the Court established the principle of the equitable
division of river or water resources between conflicting state inter-
ests. In New Jersey v. New York,1004 where New Jersey sought to
enjoin the diversion of waters into the Hudson River watershed for
New York in such a way as to diminish the flow of the Delaware
River in New Jersey, injure its shad fisheries, and increase harm-
fully the saline contents of the Delaware, Justice Holmes stated for
the Court: “A river is more than an amenity, it is a treasure. It
offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who
have power over it. New York has the physical power to cut off all
the water within its jurisdiction. But clearly the exercise of such a
power to the destruction of the interest of lower States could not
be tolerated. And on the other hand equally little could New Jersey
be permitted to require New York to give up its power altogether

issue was not one of property in the soil, but of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and
hence political. Id. at 752–53. For different reasons, it should be noted, a suit be-
tween private parties respecting soil or jurisdiction of two states, to which neither
state is a party, does not come within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
