is) the most important factor: a “prudential” attitude about the ex-
ercise of judicial review, which emphasizes that courts should be
wary of deciding on the merits any issue in which claims of prin-
ciple as to the issue and of expediency as to the power and prestige
of courts are in sharp conflict. The political question doctrine was
(and is) thus a way of avoiding a principled decision damaging to
the Court or an expedient decision damaging to the principle.650
    Baker v. Carr.—In Baker v. Carr,651 the Court undertook a ma-
jor reformulation and rationalization of the political question doc-
trine, which has considerably narrowed its application. Following
Baker, the whole of the apportionment-districting-election restric-
tion controversy previously immune to federal-court adjudication was
considered and decided on the merits,652 and the Court’s subse-
quent rejection of the doctrine in other cases disclosed narrowing
in other areas as well.653
    According to Justice Brennan, who delivered the opinion of the
Court, “it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordi-
nate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judi-
ciary’s relationship to the States, which gives rise to the ‘political
question.’ ” 654 Thus, the “nonjusticiability of a political question is
primarily a function of the separation of powers.” 655 “Deciding whether
a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution
to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch
exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate

DANGEROUS BRANCH: THE SUPREME COURT AT THE BAR OF POLITICS (1962), but see esp. 23–
28, 69–71, 183–198. See also Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 267 (1962) (Justice Frank-
furter dissenting.) The opposing view, which has been called the “classicist” view, is
that courts are duty bound to decide all cases properly before them. Cohens v. Vir-
ginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404 (1821). See also H. WECHSLER, PRINCIPLES, POLITICS,
AND FUNDAMENTAL LAW: SELECTED ESSAYS 11–15 (1961).

graphic dispersion of persons signing nominating petitions).

     654 Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210 (1962). This formulation fails to explain

cases like Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78 (1909), in which the conclusion of the gov-
ernor of a state that insurrection existed or was imminent justifying suspension of
constitutional rights was deemed binding on the Court. Cf. Sterling v. Constantin,
287 U.S. 378 (1932). The political question doctrine was applied in cases challeng-
ing the regularity of enactments of territorial legislatures. Harwood v. Wentworth,
162 U.S. 547 (1896); Lyons v. Woods, 153 U.S. 649 (1894); Clough v. Curtis, 134
U.S. 361 (1890). See also In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888); Walton v. House of
