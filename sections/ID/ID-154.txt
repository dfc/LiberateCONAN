court after we corrected its views of Federal laws, our review could
amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.” 830 The Court is
faced with two interrelated decisions: whether the state court judg-
ment is based upon a nonfederal ground and whether the nonfederal
ground is adequate to support the state court judgment. It is, of
course, the responsibility of the Court to determine for itself the
answer to both questions.831
    The first question, whether there is a nonfederal ground, may
be raised by several factual situations. A state court may have based
its decision on two grounds, one federal, one nonfederal.832 It may
have based its decision solely on a nonfederal ground but the fed-
eral ground may have been clearly raised.833 Both federal and
nonfederal grounds may have been raised but the state court judg-
ment is ambiguous or is without written opinion stating the ground
relied on.834 Or the state court may have decided the federal ques-
tion although it could have based its ruling on an adequate, inde-
pendent non-federal ground.835 In any event, it is essential for pur-
poses of review by the Supreme Court that it appear from the record
that a federal question was presented, that the disposition of that
question was necessary to the determination of the case, that the
federal question was actually decided or that the judgment could
not have been rendered without deciding it.836
    Several factors affect the answer to the second question, whether
the nonfederal ground is adequate. In order to preclude Supreme
    830  Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 125–26 (1945).
    831  E.g., Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356, 366 (1990); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.
Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 455 (1958).
     832 Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U.S. 207 (1935); Cramp v. Board of Public In-

struction, 368 U.S. 278 (1961).
     833 Wood v. Chesborough, 228 U.S. 672, 676–80 (1913).
     834 Lynch v. New York ex rel. Pierson, 293 U.S. 52, 54–55 (1934); Williams v.

Kaiser, 323 U.S. 471, 477 (1945); Durley v. Mayo, 351 U.S. 277, 281 (1956); Klinger
v. Missouri, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 257, 263 (1872); cf. Department of Mental Hygiene v.
Kirchner, 380 U.S. 194 (1965).
     835 Poafpybitty v. Skelly Oil Co., 390 U.S. 365, 375–376 (1968).
     836 Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Oklahoma, 303 U.S. 206 (1938); Raley v. Ohio,

360 U.S. 423, 434–437 (1959). When there is uncertainty about what the state court
did, the usual practice was to remand for clarification. Minnesota v. National Tea
Co., 309 U.S. 551 (1940); California v. Krivda, 409 U.S. 33 (1972). See California
Dept. of Motor Vehicles v. Rios, 410 U.S. 425 (1973). Now, however, in a controver-
sial decision, the Court has adopted a presumption that when a state court decision
fairly appears to rest on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law, and when
the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from
the face of the opinion the Court will accept as the most reasonable explanation
that the state court decided the case as it did because it believed that federal law
required it to do so. If the state court wishes to avoid the presumption it must make
clear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that discussed federal law did
not compel the result, that state law was dispositive. Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S.
1032 (1983). See Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 261 n.7 (1989) (collecting cases); Cole-
man v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991) (applying the rule in a habeas case).
