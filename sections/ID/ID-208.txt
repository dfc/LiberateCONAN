current jurisdiction in some classes of such cases.1157 Sustained in
the early years on circuit,1158 this concurrent jurisdiction was fi-
nally approved by the Court itself.1159 The Court has also relied on
the first Congress’s interpretation of the meaning of Article III in
declining original jurisdiction of an action by a state to enforce a
judgment for a pecuniary penalty awarded by one of its own courts.1160
Noting that § 13 of the Judiciary Act had referred to “controversies
of a civil nature,” Justice Gray declared that it “was passed by the
first Congress assembled under the Constitution, many of whose mem-
bers had taken part in framing that instrument, and is contempo-
raneous and weighty evidence of its true meaning.” 1161
    However, another clause of § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was
not accorded the same presumption by Chief Justice Marshall, who,
interpreting it to give the Court power to issue a writ of manda-
mus on an original proceeding, declared that, as Congress could not
restrict the original jurisdiction, neither could it enlarge it, and he
pronounced the clause void.1162 Although the Chief Justice’s inter-
pretation of the meaning of the clause may be questioned, no one
has questioned the constitutional principle it proclaimed. Although
the rule deprives Congress of power to expand or contract the juris-
diction, it allows a considerable latitude of interpretation to the Court
itself. In some cases, such as Missouri v. Holland,1163 the Court has
manifested a tendency toward a liberal construction of its original
jurisdiction, but the more usual view is that “our original jurisdic-
tion should be invoked sparingly.” 1164 Original jurisdiction “is lim-
    1157  In § 3 of the 1789 Act. The present division is in 28 U.S.C. § 1251.

suits could be brought and maintained in state courts as well. Plaquemines Tropical

     1162 Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137 (1803). The Chief Justice declared

that “a negative or exclusive sense” had to be given to the affirmative enunciation
of the cases to which original jurisdiction extends. Id. at 174. This exclusive inter-
pretation has been since followed. Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75 (1807); New
Jersey v. New York, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 284 (1831); Ex parte Barry, 43 U.S. (2 How.) 65
(1844); Ex parte Vallandigham, 68 U.S. (1 Wall.) 243, 252 (1864); Ex parte Yerger,
75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 85, 98 (1869). In the curious case of Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633
(1937), the Court was asked to unseat Justice Black on the ground that his appoint-
ment violated Article I. § 6, cl. 2. Although it rejected petitioner’s application, the
Court did not point out that it was being asked to assume original jurisdiction in
violation of Marbury v. Madison.
