judicial function.” 744 Stare decisis is a principle of policy, not a me-
chanical formula of adherence to the latest decision “however re-
cent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with
a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder,
and verified by experience.” 745 The limitation of stare decisis seems
to have been progressively weakened since the Court proceeded to
correct “a century of error” in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co.746
Since then, more than 200 decisions have been overturned,747 and
the merits of stare decisis seem more often celebrated in dissents

     744 Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406–408 (1932) (Justice

Brandeis dissenting). For recent arguments with respect to overruling or not over-
ruling previous decisions, see the self-consciously elaborate opinion for a plurality
in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 854–69 (1992) (Justices O’Connor,
Kennedy, and Souter) (acknowledging that as an original matter they would not have
decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), as the Court did and that they might
consider it wrongly decided, but nonetheless applying the principles of stare decisis—
they stressed the workability of the case’s holding, the fact that no other line of
precedent had undermined Roe, the vitality of that case’s factual underpinnings, the
reliance on the precedent in society, and the effect upon the Court’s legitimacy of
maintaining or overruling the case). See id. at 953–66 (Chief Justice Rehnquist con-
curring in part and dissenting in part), 993–1001 (Justice Scalia concurring in part
and dissenting in part). See also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827–30 (1991)
(suggesting, inter alia, that reliance is relevant in contract and property cases), and
id. at 835, 842–44 (Justice Souter concurring), 844, 848–56 (Justice Marshall dissent-
ing).
     745 Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 110 (1940) (Justice Frankfurter for Court).

See also Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 22 (1970) (Chief Justice Burger dissent-
ing). But see id. at 19 (Justice Harlan concurring in part and dissenting in part);
Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 117–119 (1970) (Justice Harlan concurring in part
and dissenting in part). Recent discussions of and both applications of and refusals
to apply stare decisis may be found in Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 251–52
(1998), and id. at 260–63 (Justice Scalia dissenting); State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S.
3, 20–2 (1997); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235–36 (1997), and id. at 523–54
(Justice Souter dissenting); United States v. IBM Corp., 517 U.S. 843, 854–56 (1996)
(noting principles of following precedent and declining to consider overturning an
old precedent when parties have not advanced arguments on the point), with which
compare id. at 863 (Justice Kennedy dissenting) (arguing that the United States had
presented the point and that the old case ought to be overturned); Adarand Construc-
tors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995) (plurality opinion) (discussing stare decisis,
citing past instances of overrulings, and overruling 1990 decision), with which com-
pare the dissents, id. at 242, 264, 271; Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S.
44, 61–73 (1996) (discussing policy of stare decisis, why it should not be followed
with respect to a 1989 decision, and overruling that precedent), with which compare
the dissents, id. at 76, 100. Justices Scalia and Thomas have argued for various
departures from precedent. E.g., Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514
U.S. 175, 200–01 (1995) (Justice Scalia concurring) (negative commerce jurispru-
dence); Colorado Republican Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 631 (1996) (Jus-
tice Thomas concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting framework of Buckley
v. Valeo and calling for overruling of part of case). Compare id. at 626 (Court notes
those issues not raised or argued).
     746 157 U.S. 429, 574–579 (1895).
     747 See Appendix. The list encompasses both constitutional and statutory inter-

pretation decisions. The Court adheres, at least formally, to the principle that stare
decisis is a stricter rule for statutory interpretation, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,
