lege granted,1405 and recent decisions for the most part confirm this
restrictive interpretation,1406 so that instances of successful resort
to the statute are fairly rare.
     Thus, the Court’s position holds, one may not obtain removal
simply by an assertion that he is being denied equal rights or that
he cannot enforce the law granting equal rights. Because the re-
moval statute requires the denial to be “in the courts of such State,”
the pretrial conduct of police and prosecutors was deemed irrel-
evant, because it afforded no basis for predicting that state courts
would not vindicate the federal rights of defendants.1407 Moreover,
in predicting a denial of rights, only an assertion founded on a fa-
cially unconstitutional state statute denying the right in question
would suffice. From the existence of such a law, it could be pre-
dicted that defendant’s rights would be denied.1408 Furthermore, the
removal statute’s reference to “any law providing for . . . equal rights”
covered only laws “providing for specific civil rights stated in terms

    1406 Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966); City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384

U.S. 808 (1966). There was a hiatus of cases reviewing removal from 1906 to 1966
because from 1887 to 1964 there was no provision for an appeal of an order of a
federal court remanding a removed case to the state courts. § 901 of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 266, 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d).
    1407 Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 803 (1966); City of Greenwood v. Peacock,

384 U.S. 808, 827 (1966). Justice Douglas in dissent, joined by Justices Black, Fortas,
and Chief Justice Warren, argued that “in the courts of such State” modified only
“cannot enforce,” so that one could be denied rights prior to as well as during a trial
and police and prosecutorial conduct would be relevant. Alternately, he argued that
state courts could be implicated in the denial prior to trial by certain actions. Id. at
844–55.
    1408 Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 797–802 (1966). Thus, in Strauder v. West

Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), African-Americans were excluded by statute from ser-
vice on grand and petit juries, and it was held that a black defendant’s criminal
indictment should have been removed because federal law secured nondiscrimina-
tory jury service and it could be predicted that he would be denied his rights before
a discriminatorily selected state jury. In Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313 (1880), there
was no state statute, but there was exclusion of Negroes from juries pursuant to
custom and removal was denied. In Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370 (1880), the state
provision authorizing discrimination in jury selection had been held invalid under
federal law by a state court, and a similar situation existed in Bush v. Kentucky,
107 U.S. 110 (1882). Removal was denied in both cases. The dissenters in City of
Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 848–52 (1966), argued that federal courts should
consider facially valid statutes which might be applied unconstitutionally and state
court enforcement of custom as well in evaluating whether a removal petitioner could
enforce his federal rights in state court.
