economic injury to encompass “aesthetic, conservational, and recre-
ational” interests as well.491 “Aesthetic and environmental well-
being, like economic well-being, are important ingredients of the qual-
ity of life in our society, and the fact that particular environmental
interests are shared by the many rather than the few does not make
them less deserving of legal protection through the judicial pro-
cess.” 492 Thus, plaintiffs who pleaded that they used the natural
resources of the Washington area, that rail freight rates would de-
ter the recycling of used goods, and that their use of natural re-
sources would be disturbed by the adverse environmental impact
caused by the nonuse of recyclable goods, had standing as “persons
aggrieved” to challenge the rates set. Neither the large numbers of
persons allegedly injured nor the indirect and less perceptible harm
to the environment was justification to deny standing. The Court
granted that the plaintiffs might never be able to establish the “at-
tenuated line of causation” from rate setting to injury, but that was
a matter for proof at trial, not for resolution on the pleadings.493
     Much debate has occurred in recent years with respect to the
validity of “citizen suit” provisions in the environmental laws, espe-
cially in light of the Court’s retrenchment in constitutional stand-
ing cases. The Court in insisting on injury in fact as well as causa-

401 U.S. 617 (1971); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318,
320 n.3 (1977). Almost contemporaneously, the Court also liberalized the ripeness
requirement in review of administrative actions. Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass’n, Inc.,
387 U.S. 167 (1967); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (1967). See also
National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.
479 (1998), in which the Court found that a bank had standing to challenge an agency
ruling expanding the role of employer credit unions to include multi-employer credit
unions, despite a statutory limit that any such union could be of groups having a
common bond of occupation or association. The Court held that a plaintiff did not
have to show it was the congressional purpose to protect its interests. It is sufficient
if the interest asserted is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected . . .
by the statute.” Id. at 492 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But the
Court divided 5-to-4 in applying the test. See also Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154
(1997).
     491 Ass’n of Data Processing Service Org. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 154 (1970).
     492 Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734 (1972), Moreover, said the Court,

once a person establishes that he has standing to seek judicial review of an action
because of particularized injury to him, he may argue the public interest as a “rep-
resentative of the public interest,” as a “private attorney general,” so that he may
contest not only the action which injures him but the entire complex of actions of
which his injury-inducing action is a part. Id. at 737–738, noting Scripps-Howard
Radio v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4 (1942); FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S.
(1940). See also Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 103 n. (1979);
Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 376 n.16 (1982) (noting ability of
such party to represent interests of third parties).
     493 United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 683–690 (1973). As was noted above,

this case has been disparaged by the later Court. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
504 U.S. 555, 566–67 (1992); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158–160 (1990).
