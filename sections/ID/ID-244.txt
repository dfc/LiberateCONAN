     Second, Sanders v. United States 1356 dealt with two interre-
lated questions: the effects to be given successive petitions for the
writ, when the second or subsequent application presented grounds
previously asserted or grounds not theretofore raised. Emphasizing
that “[c]onventional notions of finality of litigation have no place
where life or liberty is at stake and infringement of constitutional
rights is alleged,” 1357 the Court set out generous standards for con-
sideration of successive claims. As to previously asserted grounds,
the Court held that controlling weight may be given to a prior de-
nial of relief if (1) the same ground presented was determined ad-
versely to the applicant before, (2) the prior determination was on
the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reach-
ing the merits of the subsequent application, so that the habeas court
might but was not obligated to deny relief without considering the
claim on the merits.1358 With respect to grounds not previously as-
serted, a federal court considering a successive petition could re-
fuse to hear the new claim only if it decided the petitioner had de-
liberately bypassed the opportunity in the prior proceeding to raise
it; if not, “[n]o matter how many prior applications for federal col-
lateral relief a prisoner has made,” the court must consider the mer-
its of the new claim.1359
     Third, the most controversial of the 1963 cases, Fay v. Noia,1360
dealt with the important issue of state defaults, of, that is, what
the effect on habeas is when a defendant in a state criminal trial
has failed to raise in a manner in accordance with state procedure
a claim which he subsequently wants to raise on habeas. If, for ex-
ample, a defendant fails to object to the admission of certain evi-
     1356 373 U.S. 1 (1963). Sanders was a § 2255 case, a federal prisoner petitioning

for postconviction relief. The Court applied the same liberal rules with respect to
federal prisoners as it did for state. See Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217
(1969). As such, the case has also been eroded by subsequent cases. E.g., Davis v.
United States, 411 U.S. 233 (1973); United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152 (1982).
     1357 373 U.S. at 8. The statement accorded with the established view that prin-

ciples of res judicata were not applicable in habeas. E.g., Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S.
266 (1948); Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U.S. 239 (1924); Salinger v. Loisel, 265
U.S. 224 (1924). Congress in 1948 had appeared to adopt some limited version of
res judicata for federal prisoners but not for state prisoners, Act of June 25, 1948,
62 Stat. 965, 967, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2255, but the Court in Sanders held the same
standards applicable and denied the statute changed existing caselaw. 373 U.S. at
11–14. But see id. at 27–28 (Justice Harlan dissenting).
     1358 373 U.S. at 15. In codifying the Sanders standards in 1966, Pub. L. 89–711,

80 Stat. 1104, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b), Congress omitted the “ends of justice” language.
Although it was long thought that the omission probably had no substantive effect,
this may not be the case. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986).
     1359 373 U.S. at 17–19.
     1360 372 U.S. 391 (1963). Fay was largely obliterated over the years, beginning

with Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233 (1973), a federal-prisoner post-conviction
relief case, and Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977), but it was not formally
overruled until Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 744–51 (1991).
