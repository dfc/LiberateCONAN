of several Supreme Court interpretations of the Fair Labor Stan-
dards Act; it also provided that no court should have jurisdiction to
enforce any claim arising from these decisions. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained the Act.1233 The
court noted that the withdrawal of jurisdiction would be ineffective
if the extinguishment of the claims as a substantive matter were
invalid. “We think . . . that the exercise by Congress of its control
over jurisdiction is subject to compliance with at least the require-
ments of the Fifth Amendment. That is to say, while Congress has
the undoubted power to give, withhold, and restrict the jurisdiction
of the courts other than the Supreme Court, it must not so exercise
that power as to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property with-
out due process of law or to take private property without just com-
pensation.” 1234 The Court, however, found that the Portal-to-Portal
Act “did not violate the Fifth Amendment in so far as it may have
withdrawn from private individuals . . . any rights . . . which rested
upon private contracts they had made. Nor is the Portal-to-Portal
Act a violation of Article III of the Constitution or an encroach-
ment upon the separate power of the judiciary.” 1235
    Conclusion.—There thus remains a measure of doubt that Con-
gress’s power over the federal courts is as plenary as some of the
Court’s language suggests it is. Congress has a vast amount of dis-
cretion in conferring and withdrawing and structuring the original
and appellate jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts and the ap-
pellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; so much is clear from the
practice since 1789 and the holdings of many Court decisions. That
its power extends to accomplishing by means of its control over ju-
risdiction actions which it could not do directly by substantive en-
actment is by no means clear from the text of the Constitution or
from the cases.
