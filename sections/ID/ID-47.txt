United Mine Workers,234 the Court held, first, that disobedience of
a temporary restraining order issued for the purpose of maintain-
ing existing conditions, pending the determination of the court’s ju-
risdiction, is punishable as criminal contempt where the issue is
not frivolous, but substantial.235 Second, the Court held that an or-
der issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and
person must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly
and proper proceedings, even though the statute under which the
order is issued is unconstitutional.236 Third, on the basis of United
States v. Shipp,237 the Court held that violations of a court’s order
are punishable as criminal contempt, even if the order is set aside
on appeal as in excess of the court’s jurisdiction and even if the
basic action has become moot.238 Finally, the Court held that con-
duct can amount to both civil and criminal contempt, and the same
acts may justify a court in resorting to coercive and punitive mea-
sures, which may be imposed in a single proceeding.239
    Contempt Power in Aid of Administrative Power.—
Proceedings to enforce the orders of administrative agencies and sub-
poenas issued by them to appear and produce testimony have be-
come increasingly common since the leading case of ICC v. Brimson,240
which held that the contempt power of the courts might by statu-
tory authorization be used to aid the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion in enforcing compliance with its orders. In 1947 a proceeding
to enforce a subpoena duces tecum issued by the Securities and Ex-
change Commission during the course of an investigation was ruled
to be civil in character on the ground that the only sanction was a
penalty designed to compel obedience. The Court then enunciated
the principle that, where a fine or imprisonment imposed on the
contemnor is designed to coerce him to do what he has refused to
do, the proceeding is one for civil contempt.241 Notwithstanding the
