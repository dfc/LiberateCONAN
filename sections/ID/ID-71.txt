presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for
illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” 376 This practical
conception of standing has now given way to a primary emphasis
upon separation of powers as the guide. “[T]he ‘case or controversy’
requirement defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of
separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded.
The several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that require-
ment are ‘founded in concern about the proper—and properly limited—
role of the courts in a democratic society.’ ” 377
    Standing as a doctrine is composed of both constitutional and
prudential restraints on the power of the federal courts to render
decisions,378 and is almost exclusively concerned with such public
law questions as determinations of constitutionality and review of
administrative or other governmental action.379 As such, it is often
interpreted according to the prevailing philosophies of judicial activ-
ism and restraint, and narrowly or broadly in terms of the viewed
desirability of access to the courts by persons seeking to challenge
legislation or other governmental action. The trend in the 1960s was
to broaden access; in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, it was to narrow
access by stiffening the requirements of standing, although Court
majorities were not entirely consistent. The major difficulty in set-
ting forth the standards is that the Court’s generalizations and the
results it achieves are often at variance.380

      376 Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). That persons or organizations have

a personal, ideological interest sufficiently strong to create adverseness is not alone
enough to confer standing; rather, the adverseness is the consequence of one being
able to satisfy the Article III requisite of injury in fact. Valley Forge Christian Col-
lege v. Americans United, 454 U.S. 464, 482–486 (1982); Schlesinger v. Reservists
Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 225–226 (1974). Nor is the fact that, if plain-
tiffs have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, a sufficient basis for find-
ing standing. Id. at 227.
      377 Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.

490, 498 (1975)). All the standards relating to whether a plaintiff is entitled to adju-
dication of his claims must be evaluated “by reference to the Art. III notion that
federal courts may exercise power only ‘in the last resort, and as a necessity,’ . . .
and only when adjudication is ‘consistent with a system of separated powers and
[the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the
judicial process.’ ” Id. at 752 (quoting, respectively, Chicago & G.T. Ry. v. Wellman,
143 U.S. 339, 345 (1892), and Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968)). For the strength-
ening of the separation-of-powers barrier to standing, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wild-
life, 504 U.S. 555, 559–60, 571–78 (1992).

      380 “[T]he concept of ‘Art. III standing’ has not been defined with complete con-

sistency in all of the various cases decided by this Court . . . [and] this very fact is
probably proof that the concept cannot be reduced to a one-sentence or one-
paragraph definition.” Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United, 454 U.S.
