    Attorney General Randolph, upon the refusal of the circuit courts
to act under the new statute, filed a motion for mandamus in the
Supreme Court to direct the Circuit Court in Pennsylvania to pro-
ceed on a petition filed by one Hayburn seeking a pension. Al-
though the Court heard argument, it put off decision until the next
term, presumably because Congress was already acting to delete the
objectionable features of the act. Upon enactment of the new law,
the Court dismissed the action.154 Although the Court’s opinion con-
tained little analysis, Hayburn’s Case has since been cited by the
Court to reject efforts to give it and the lower federal courts juris-
diction over cases in which judgment would be subject to executive
or legislative revision.155 Thus, in a 1948 case, the Court held that
an order of the Civil Aeronautics Board denying to a citizen air car-
rier a certificate of convenience and necessity for an overseas and
foreign air route was, despite statutory language to the contrary,
not reviewable by the courts. Because Congress had also deemed
such an order subject to discretionary review and revision by the
President, the lower court found, and the Supreme Court affirmed,
that the courts did not have the authority to review the President’s
decision. While the lower Court had then attempted to reconcile the
statutory scheme by permitting presidential review of the order af-
ter judicial review, the Court rejected this interpretation. “[I]f the
President may completely disregard the judgment of the court, it
would be only because it is one the courts were not authorized to
render. Judgments within the powers vested in courts by the Judi-
ciary Article of the Constitution may not lawfully be revised, over-
turned or refused faith and credit by another Department of Gov-




Justices declared their willingness to perform under the act as commissioners rather
than as judges. Cf. United States v. Ferreira, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 40, 52–53 (1852).
The assumption by judges that they could act in some positions as individuals while
remaining judges, an assumption many times acted upon, was approved in Mistretta
v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 397–408 (1989).
     154 Hayburn’s Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409 (1792). The new pension law was the

Act of February 28, 1793, 1 Stat. 324. The reason for the Court’s inaction may, on
the other hand, have been doubt about the proper role of the Attorney General in
the matter, an issue raised in the opinion. See Marcus & Teir, Hayburn’s Case: A
Misinterpretation of Precedent, 1988 WIS. L. REV. 4; Bloch, The Early Role of the At-
torney General in Our Constitutional Scheme: In the Beginning There was Pragma-
tism, 1989 DUKE L. J. 561, 590–618. Notice the Court’s discussion in Plaut v. Spend-
thrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 218, 225–26 (1995).

v. Kritensen, 340 U.S. 162, 167–168 (1950).
