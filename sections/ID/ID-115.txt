known to the law. The origin, scope, and purpose of the concept have
eluded all attempts at precise statements.” 608
     It has been suggested that it may be more useful to itemize the
categories of questions that have been labeled political rather than
to attempt to isolate the factors that a court will consider to iden-
tify such cases.609 The Court has to some extent agreed, noting that
the criteria applied by the Court in political questions cases can
vary depending on the issue involved.610 Regardless of which ap-
proach is taken, however, the Court’s narrowing of the rationale for
political questions in Baker v. Carr,611 discussed below, appears to
have changed the nature of the inquiry radically.
    Origins and Development.—In the first decade after ratifica-
tion of the Constitution, the Court in Ware v. Hylton 612 refused to
pass on the question whether a treaty had been broken, and in Mar-
tin v. Mott,613 the Court held that the President acting under con-
gressional authorization had exclusive and unreviewable power to
determine when the militia should be called out. But the roots of
the doctrine are most clearly seen in Marbury v. Madison,614 where
Chief Justice Marshall stated: “The province of the court is, solely,
to decide on the rights of individuals, not to inquire how the execu-
tive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a dis-
cretion. Questions in their nature political, or which are, by the con-
stitution and laws, submitted to the executive can never be made
in this court.” 615
    In Luther v. Borden,616 however, the Court made clear that the
doctrine went beyond considerations of interference with executive
functions. This case, arising from the Dorr Rebellion (a period of
     608 Frank, Political Questions, in SUPREME COURT AND SUPREME LAW (E. Cahn, ed.,

1954), at 36.
     609 The concept of political question is “more amenable to description by infinite

itemization than by generalization” Id.

     611 369 U.S. at 208–232.
     612 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796).

     615 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) at 170. In Decatur v. Paulding, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 497, 516 (1840),

the Court, refusing an effort by mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Navy to
pay a pension, said: “The interference of the courts with the performance of the or-
dinary duties of the executive departments of the government, would be productive
of nothing but mischief; and we are quite satisfied, that such a power was never
intended to be given to them.” It therefore follows that mandamus will lie against
an executive official only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty, which ad-
mits of no discretion, and may not be invoked to control executive or political duties
which admit of discretion. See Georgia v. Stanton, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 50 (1867); Mis-
sissippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475 (1867); Kendall v. United States ex rel.
Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524 (1838).
