ment powers was held to be nonjusticiable; there was a textually
demonstrable commitment of the issue to the Senate, and there was
a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for re-
solving the issue.668
    Despite the occasional resort to the doctrine, the Court contin-
ues to reject its application in language that confines its scope. Thus,
when parties challenged the actions of the Secretary of Commerce
in declining to certify, as required by statute, that Japanese whal-
ing practices undermined the effectiveness of international conven-
tions, the Court rejected the Government’s argument that the politi-
cal question doctrine precluded decision on the merits. The Court’s
prime responsibility, it said, is to interpret statutes, treaties, and
executive agreements; the interplay of the statutes and the agree-
ments in this case implicated the foreign relations of the Nation.
“But under the Constitution, one of the Judiciary’s characteristic
roles is to interpret statutes, and we cannot shirk this responsibil-
ity merely because our decision may have significant political over-
tones.” 669
     After requesting argument on the issue, the Court held that a
challenge to a statute on the ground that it did not originate in the
House of Representatives as required by the Origination Clause was
justiciable.670 Turning back reliance on the various factors set out
in Baker, in much the same tone as in Powell v. McCormack, the
Court continued to evidence the view that only questions textually
committed to another branch are political questions. Invalidation
of a statute because it did not originate in the right House would
not demonstrate a “lack of respect” for the House that passed the
bill. “[D]isrespect,” in the sense of rejecting Congress’s reading of
the Constitution, “cannot be sufficient to create a political question.
If it were every judicial resolution of a constitutional challenge to a
congressional enactment would be impermissible.” 671 That the House
of Representatives has the power and incentives to protect its pre-
rogatives by not passing a bill violating the Origination Clause did
and id. at 491 (Justice Rehnquist concurring). See also Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S.
996, 1002 (1979) (Justices Rehnquist, Stewart, and Stevens, and Chief Justice Burger
using political question analysis to dismiss a challenge to presidential action). But
see id. at 997, 998 (Justice Powell rejecting analysis for this type of case).
     668 Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993). The Court pronounced its deci-

sion as perfectly consonant with Powell v. McCormack. Id. at 236–38.

ing is justiciable). But see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004) (no workable stan-
dard has been found for measuring burdens on representational rights imposed by
political gerrymandering).
