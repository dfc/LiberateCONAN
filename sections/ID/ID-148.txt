    Civil Rights Act Jurisdiction.—Perhaps the most important
of the special federal question jurisdictional statutes is that confer-
ring jurisdiction on federal district courts to hear suits challenging
the deprivation under color of state law or custom of any right, privi-
lege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or by any act of Con-
gress providing for equal rights.797 Because it contains no jurisdic-



that it will infer an action only in instances of fairly clear congressional intent. Can-
non v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979); California v. Sierra Club, 451
U.S. 287 (1981); Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Ass’n,
453 U.S. 1 (1981); Merrill, Lynch v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353 (1982); Thompson v. Thomp-
son, 484 U.S. 174 (1988); Karahalios v. National Fed’n of Fed. Employees, 489 U.S.
527 (1989).
     The Court appeared more ready to infer private causes of action for constitu-
tional violations, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971); Davis
v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980), but it has
retreated here as well, refusing to apply Bivens when “any alternative, existing pro-
cess for protecting the interest” that is threatened exists, or when “any special fac-
tors counseling hesitation” are present. Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 550 (2007).
Accord Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–1104, slip op. (2012) (state tort law
provided alternative, if not wholly congruent, process for protecting constitutional
interests of a prisoner allegedly abused by private prison guards). See also Chappell
v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 298 (1983); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983); Schweiker
v. Chilicki, 487 U.S. 412 (1988); FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (1994); Correctional
Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61 (2001).
     “Federal common law” may exist in a number of areas where federal interests
are involved and federal courts may take cognizance of such suits under their “aris-
ing under” jurisdiction. E.g., Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S. 91 (1972); Inter-
national Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481 (1987). See also County of Oneida v.
Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 236–240 (1985); National Farmers Union Ins.
Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845 (1985). The Court is, however, somewhat wary of
finding “federal common law” in the absence of some congressional authorization to
formulate substantive rules, Texas Industries v. Radcliff Materials, 451 U.S. 630 (1981),
and Congress may always statutorily displace the judicially created law. City of Mil-
waukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304 (1981). Finally, federal courts have federal question
jurisdiction of claims created by state law if there exists an important necessity for
an interpretation of an act of Congress. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255
U.S. 180 (1921).
     797 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3). The cause of action to which this jurisdictional grant

applies is 42 U.S.C. § 1983, making liable and subject to other redress any person
who, acting under color of state law, deprives any person of any rights, privileges,
or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States. For dis-
cussion of the history and development of these two statutes, see Monroe v. Pape,
365 U.S. 167 (1961); Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538 (1972); Monell
v. New York City Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978); Chapman v. Houston
Welfare Rights Org., 441 U.S. 600 (1979); Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980).
Although the two statutes originally had the same wording in respect to “the Con-
stitution and laws of the United States,” when the substantive and jurisdictional
aspects were separated and codified, § 1983 retained the all-inclusive “laws” provi-
sion, while § 1343(3) read “any Act of Congress providing for equal rights.” The Court
has interpreted the language of the two statutes literally, so that while claims un-
der laws of the United States need not relate to equal rights but may encompass
welfare and regulatory laws, Maine v. Thiboutot; but see Middlesex County Sewer-
age Auth. v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1 (1981), such suits if they do
