by the principles of maritime law as respected by maritime courts
of all nations and adopted by most, if not by all, of them on the
continent of Europe.854
    Although a number of Supreme Court decisions had earlier sus-
tained the broader admiralty jurisdiction on specific issues,855 it was
not until 1848 that the Court ruled squarely in its favor, which it
did by declaring that “whatever may have been the doubt, origi-
nally, as to the true construction of the grant, whether it had refer-
ence to the jurisdiction in England, or to the more enlarged one
that existed in other maritime countries, the question has become
settled by legislative and judicial interpretation, which ought not
now to be disturbed.” 856 The Court thereupon proceeded to hold that
admiralty had jurisdiction in personam as well as in rem over con-
troversies arising out of contracts of affreightment between New York
and Providence.
    Power of Congress To Modify Maritime Law.—The Consti-
tution does not identify the source of the substantive law to be ap-
plied in the federal courts in cases of admiralty and maritime juris-
diction. Nevertheless, the grant of power to the federal courts in
Article III necessarily implies the existence of a substantive mari-
time law which, if they are required to do so, the federal courts
can fashion for themselves.857 But what of the power of Congress
in this area? In The Lottawanna,858 Justice Bradley undertook a
definitive exposition of the subject. No doubt, the opinion of the Court
notes, there exists “a great mass of maritime law which is the same
in all commercial countries,” still “the maritime law is only so far
operative as law in any country as it is adopted by the laws and

tawanna, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 576–77 (1875) (“But we must always remember
that the court cannot make the law, it can only declare it. If, within its proper scope,
any change is desired in its rules, other than those of procedure, it must be made
by the legislative department”). States can no more override rules of judicial origin
than they can override acts of Congress. Wilburn Boat Co. v. Firemen’s Fund Ins.
