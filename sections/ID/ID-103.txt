arising from the legislation or from enforcement of it,546 or because
the courts need before them the details of a concrete factual situa-
tion arising from enforcement in order to engage in a reasoned bal-
ancing of individual rights and governmental interests.547 But one
who challenges a statute or possible administrative action need dem-
onstrate only a realistic danger of sustaining an injury to his rights
as a result of the statute’s operation and enforcement and need not
await the consummation of the threatened injury in order to ob-
tain preventive relief, such as exposing himself to actual arrest or
prosecution. When one alleges an intention to engage in conduct
arguably affected with a constitutional interest but proscribed by
statute and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereun-
der, he may bring an action for declaratory or injunctive relief.548
Similarly, the reasonable certainty of the occurrence of the per-
ceived threat to a constitutional interest is sufficient to afford a ba-
sis for bringing a challenge, provided the court has sufficient facts
before it to enable it to intelligently adjudicate the issues.549
    Of considerable uncertainty in the law of ripeness is Duke Power,
in which the Court held ripe for decision on the merits a challenge
to a federal law limiting liability for nuclear accidents at nuclear
power plants, on the basis that, because the plaintiffs had sus-
tained an injury-in-fact and had standing, the Article III requisite
of ripeness was satisfied and no additional facts arising out of the
occurrence of the claimed harm would enable the court better to

In the context of the ripeness to challenge of agency regulations, as to which there
is a presumption of available judicial remedies, the Court has long insisted that fed-
eral courts should be reluctant to review such regulations unless the effects of ad-
ministrative action challenged have been felt in a concrete way by the challenging
parties, i.e., unless the controversy is “ripe.” See, of the older cases, Abbott Labora-
tories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136 (1967); Toilet Goods Ass’n, Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S.
158 (1967); Gardner v. Toilet Goods Ass’n, Inc., 387 U.S. 167 (1967). More recent
cases include Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U.S. 43 (1993); Lujan v. Na-
tional Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990).

ginia Surface Mining & Recl. Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, 294–297 (1981); Renne v. Geary,
