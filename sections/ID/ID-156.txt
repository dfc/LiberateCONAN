of itself preclude suits in state courts against consular officials. The
leading case is Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler,845 in which a Ruma-
nian vice-consul contested an Ohio judgment against him for di-
vorce and alimony.
    A number of incidental questions arise in connection with the
phrase “affecting ambassadors and consuls.” Does the ambassador
or consul to be affected have to be a party in interest, or is a mere
indirect interest in the outcome of the proceeding sufficient? In United
States v. Ortega,846 the Court ruled that a prosecution of a person
for violating international law and the laws of the United States
by offering violence to the person of a foreign minister was not a
suit “affecting” the minister but a public prosecution for vindica-
tion of the laws of nations and the United States. Another question
concerns the official status of a person claiming to be an ambassa-
dor or consul.
    The Court has refused to review the decision of the Executive
with respect to the public character of a person claiming to be a
public minister and has laid down the rule that it has the right to
accept a certificate from the Department of State on such a ques-
tion.847 A third question was whether the clause included ambassa-
dors and consuls accredited by the United States to foreign govern-
ments. The Court held that it includes only persons accredited to
the United States by foreign governments.848 However, in matters
of especial delicacy, such as suits against ambassadors and public
ministers or their servants, where the law of nations permits such
suits, and in all controversies of a civil nature in which a state is a
party, Congress until recently made the original jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court exclusive of that of other courts.849 By its compli-
ance with the congressional distribution of exclusive and concur-
rent original jurisdiction, the Court has tacitly sanctioned the power
of Congress to make such jurisdiction exclusive or concurrent as it
may choose.

Cases of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction
    The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts
had its origins in the jurisdiction vested in the courts of the Admi-
ral of the English Navy. Prior to independence, vice-admiralty courts
were created in the Colonies by commissions from the English High

    846  24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 467 (1826).
     847 In re Baiz, 135 U.S. 403, 432 (1890).
     848 Ex parte Gruber, 269 U.S. 302 (1925).
     849 1 Stat. 80–81 (1789). Jurisdiction in the Supreme Court since 1978 has been

original but not exclusive. Pub. L. 95–393, § 8(b), 92 Stat. 810, 28 U.S.C. § 1251(b)(1).
