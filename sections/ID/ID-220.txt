tains that a certain state of things exists, its jurisdiction is to cease
and it is required to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.”
    “It seems to us that this is not an exercise of the acknowledged
power of Congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to
the appellate power.” 1220 The statute was void for two reasons; it
“infring[ed] the constitutional power of the Executive,” 1221 and it
“prescrib[ed] a rule for the decision of a cause in a particular way.” 1222
Klein thus stands for the proposition that Congress may not vio-
late the principle of separation of powers 1223 and that it may not
accomplish certain forbidden substantive acts by casting them in
jurisdictional terms.1224
    Other restraints on congressional power over the federal courts
may be gleaned from the opinion in the much-disputed Crowell v.
Benson.1225 In an 1856 case, the Court distinguished between mat-
ters of private right which from their nature were the subject of a
suit at the common law, equity, or admiralty and which cannot be
withdrawn from judicial cognizance, and those matters of public right
which, though susceptible of judicial determination, did not require
it and which might or might not be brought within judicial cogni-
zance.1226 What this might mean was elaborated in Crowell v.
Benson,1227 involving the finality to be accorded administrative find-
ings of jurisdictional facts in compensation cases. In holding that
an employer was entitled to a trial de novo of the constitutional
jurisdictional facts of the matter of the employer-employee relation-
ship and of the occurrence of the injury in interstate commerce, Chief
Justice Hughes fused the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-
ment and Article III but emphasized that the issue ultimately was
“rather a question of the appropriate maintenance of the Federal

Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. 371, 391–405 (1980), and id. at 424, 427–34 (Justice Rehnquist
dissenting). See also Pope v. United States, 323 U.S. 1, 8–9 (1944); Glidden Co. v.
Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 568 (1962) (Justice Harlan). In Robertson v. Seattle Audubon
Society, 503 U.S. 429 (1992), the Ninth Circuit had held unconstitutional under Klein
a statute that it construed to deny the federal courts power to construe the law, but
the Supreme Court held that Congress had changed the law that the courts were to
apply. The Court declined to consider whether Klein was properly to be read as void-
ing a law “because it directed decisions in pending cases without amending any law.”
