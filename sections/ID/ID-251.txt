ing this showing.1390 Then, in In re Troy Anthony Davis,1391 the Court
found a death-row convict with a claim of actual innocence to be
entitled to a District Court determination of his habeas petition.
Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg
and Breyer, noted that the fact that seven of the state’s key wit-
nesses had recanted their trial testimony, and that several people
had implicated the state’s principal witness as the shooter, made
the case “exceptional.” 1392
    In Schlup v. Delo,1393 the Court adopted the plurality opinion
of Kuhlmann v. Wilson and held that, absent a sufficient showing
of “cause and prejudice,” a claimant filing a successive or abusive
petition must, as an initial matter, make a showing of “actual inno-
cence” so as to fall within the narrow class of cases implicating a
fundamental miscarriage of justice. The Court divided, however, with
respect to the showing a claimant must make. One standard, found
in some of the cases, was championed by the dissenters; “to show
‘actual innocence’ one must show by clear and convincing evidence
that but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have
found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty.” 1394 The Court
adopted a second standard, under which the petitioner must dem-
onstrate that “a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the
conviction of one who is actually innocent.” To meet this burden, a
claimant “must show that it is more likely than not that no reason-
able juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evi-
dence.” 1395

      1390 506 U.S. at 417–419. Justices Scalia and Thomas would have unequivocally

held that “[t]here is no basis in text, tradition, or even in contemporary practice
. . . for finding in the Constitution a right to demand judicial consideration of newly
discovered evidence of innocence brought forward after conviction.” Id. at 427–28
(concurring). However, it is not at all clear that all the Justices joining the Court
believe innocence to be nondispositive on habeas. Id. at 419 (Justices O’Connor and
Kennedy concurring), 429 (Justice White concurring). In House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518,
554–55 (2006), the Court declined to resolve the issue that in Herrera it had as-
sumed without deciding: that “a truly persuasive demonstration of ‘actual inno-
cence’ made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional.”

      1391 557 U.S. ___, No. 08–1443 (2009).
      1392 Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, dissented, writing, “This Court has

never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who
has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is
‘actually’ innocent.” He also wrote that the defendant’s “claim is a sure loser” and
that the Supreme Court was sending the District Court “on a fool’s errand.”
      1393 513 U.S. 298 (1995).
      1394 513 U.S. at 334 (Chief Justice Rehnquist dissenting, with Justices Kennedy

and Thomas), 342 (Justice Scalia dissenting, with Justice Thomas). This standard
was drawn from Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333 (1992).
      1395 513 U.S. at 327. This standard was drawn from Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.

478 (1986).
