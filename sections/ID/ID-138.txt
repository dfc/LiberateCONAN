tion.733 In various forms this maxim has been repeated to such an
extent that it has become trite, and has increasingly come to be
incorporated in cases in which a finding of unconstitutionality has
been made as a reassurance of the Court’s limited review. And it
should be noted that at times the Court has absorbed natural rights
doctrines into the text of the Constitution, so that it was able to
reject natural law per se and still partake of its fruits and the same
thing is true of the laissez faire principles incorporated in judicial
decisions from about 1890 to 1937.734
    Presumption of Constitutionality.—“It is but a decent re-
spect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body,
by which any law is passed,” wrote Justice Bushrod Washington,
“to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Consti-
tution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 735 A corollary of this
maxim is that if the constitutional question turns upon circum-
stances, courts will presume the existence of a state of facts which
would justify the legislation that is challenged.736 It seems appar-
ent, however, that with regard to laws which trench upon First Amend-
ment freedoms and perhaps other rights guaranteed by the Bill of
Rights such deference is far less than it would be toward statutory
regulation of economic matters.737
    Disallowance by Statutory Interpretation.—If it is possible
to construe a statute so that its validity can be sustained against a

     A supposedly hallowed tenet is that the Court will not look to the motives of
legislators in determining the validity of a statute. Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cr.)
87 (1810); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); Palmer v. Thompson, 403
U.S. 217 (1971). Yet an intent to discriminate is a requisite to finding at least some
equal protection violations, Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976); Village of Ar-
lington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), and a secu-
lar or religious purpose is one of the parts of the tripartite test under the Establish-
ment Clause. Committee for Pub. Educ. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U.S.
646, 653 (1980), and id. at 665 (dissent). Other constitutional decisions have also
turned upon the Court’s assessment of purpose or motive. E.g., Gomillion v. Lightfoot,
364 U.S. 339 (1960); Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U.S. 20 (1922).
     733 Cf. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 522 (1965) (Justice Black dissent-

ing). But note above the reference to the ethical mode of constitutional argument.
     734 E.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905); United States v. Butler, 297

U.S. 1 (1936).
     735 Ogden v. Saunders, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 213, 270 (1827). See also Fletcher v.

Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cr.) 87, 128 (1810); Legal Tender Cases (Knox v. Lee), 79 U.S. (12
Wall.) 457, 531 (1871).
     736 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 132 (1877); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas

Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78–79 (1911); Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580,
584 (1935).
     737 E.g., United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967); United Mine Workers v.

Illinois State Bar Ass’n, 389 U.S. 217 (1967). But see McGowan v. Maryland, 366
U.S. 420, 426 (1961). The development of the “compelling state interest” test in cer-
tain areas of equal protection litigation also bespeaks less deference to the legisla-
tive judgment.
