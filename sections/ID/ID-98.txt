ment procedure.514 These doubts were largely dispelled by Court de-
cisions in the late 1920s and early 1930s,515 and Congress quickly
responded with the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934.516
Quickly tested, the Act was unanimously sustained.517 “The prin-
ciple involved in this form of procedure,” the House report said, “is
to confer upon the courts the power to exercise in some instances
preventive relief; a function now performed rather clumsily by our
equitable proceedings and inadequately by the law courts.” 518 The
Senate report stated: “The declaratory judgment differs in no essen-
tial respect from any other judgment except that it is not followed
by a decree for damages, injunction, specific performance, or other
immediately coercive decree. It declares conclusively and finally the
rights of parties in litigations over a contested issue, a form of re-
lief which often suffices to settle controversies and fully administer
justice.” 519
    The 1934 Act provided that “[i]n cases of actual controversy”
federal courts could “declare rights and other legal relations of any
interested party petitioning for such declaration, whether or not fur-
ther relief is or could be prayed. . . .” 520 Upholding the Act, the Court
wrote: “The Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in its limitation to
‘cases of actual controversy,’ manifestly has regard to the constitu-
tional provision and is operative only in respect to controversies which
are such in the constitutional sense. The word ‘actual’ is one of em-
phasis rather than of definition. Thus the operation of the Declara-
tory Judgment Act is procedural only. In providing remedies and
defining procedure in relation to cases and controversies in the con-
stitutional sense the Congress is acting within its delegated power
over the jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is au-
