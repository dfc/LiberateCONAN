nated unseaworthiness recoveries by persons covered by the Act and
substituted a recovery under the LHWCA itself for injuries caused
by negligence.936
    (3) In The Harrisburg,937 the Court held that maritime law did
not afford an action for wrongful death, a position to which the Court
adhered until 1970.938 The Jones Act,939 the Death on the High Seas
Act,940 and the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensa-
tion Act 941 created causes of action for wrongful death, but for cases
not falling within one of these laws the federal courts looked to state
wrongful death and survival statutes.942 Thus, in The Tungus v.
Skovgaard,943 the Court held that a state wrongful death statute
encompassed claims both for negligence and unseaworthiness in the
instance of a land-based worker killed when on board ship in navi-
gable water; the Court divided five-to-four, however, in holding that
the standards of the duties to furnish a seaworthy vessel and to
use due care were created by the state law as well and not fur-
nished by general maritime concepts.944 And, in Hess v. United



     936 86 Stat. 1263, § 18, amending 33 U.S.C. § 905. On the negligence standards

under the amendment, see Scindia Steam Navigation Co., v. De Los Santos, 451 U.S.
156 (1981).
     937 119 U.S. 199 (1886). Subsequent cases are collected in Moragne v. States Ma-

rine Lines, 398 U.S. 375 (1970).
     938 Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U.S. 375 (1970).
     939 41 Stat. 1007 (1920). 46 U.S.C. § 688. Recovery could be had if death re-

sulted from injuries because of negligence but not from unseaworthiness.
     940 41 Stat. 537 (1920), 46 U.S.C. §§ 761 et seq. The Act applies to deaths caused

by negligence occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of
any state. In Rodrique v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 395 U.S. 352 (1969), a unani-
mous Court held that this Act did not apply in cases of deaths on the artificial is-
lands created on the continental shelf for oil drilling purposes but that the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, 67 Stat. 462 (1953), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1331 et seq., incorpo-
rated the laws of the adjacent state, so that Louisiana law governed. See also Chev-
ron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97 (1971); Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453
U.S. 473 (1981). However, in Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U.S. 207 (1986),
the Court held that the Act is the exclusive wrongful death remedy in the case of
OCS platform workers killed in a helicopter crash 35 miles off shore en route to
shore from a platform.
     941 44 Stat. 1424 (1927), as amended, 33 U.S.C. §§ 901–950.
     942 Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U.S. 233 (1921); Just v. Chambers, 312 U.S.

383 (1941); Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. 648 (1953).
     943 358 U.S. 588 (1959).
     944 Justice Brennan, joined by Chief Justice Warren and Justices Black and Doug-

las, argued that the extent of the duties owed the decedent while on board ship
should be governed by federal maritime law, though the cause of action originated
in a state statute, just as would have been the result had decedent survived his
injuries. See also United N.Y. & N.J. Sandy Hooks Pilot Ass’n v. Halecki, 358 U.S.
613 (1959).
