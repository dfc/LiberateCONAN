     Stockholder Suits.—Moreover, adversity in parties has often
been found in suits by stockholders against their corporation in which
the constitutionality of a statute or a government action is drawn
in question, even though one may suspect that the interests of plain-
tiffs and defendant are not all that dissimilar. Thus, in Pollock v.
Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co.,369 the Court sustained the jurisdiction
of a district court which had enjoined the company from paying an
income tax even though the suit was brought by a stockholder against
the company, thereby circumventing a statute which forbade the main-
tenance in any court of a suit to restrain the collection of any tax.370
Subsequently, the Court sustained jurisdiction in cases brought by
a stockholder to restrain a company from investing its funds in farm
loan bonds issued by federal land banks 371 and by preferred stock-
holders against a utility company and the TVA to enjoin the perfor-
mance of contracts between the company and TVA on the ground
that the statute creating it was unconstitutional.372 Perhaps most
notorious was Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,373 in which the president
of the company brought suit against the company and its officials,
among whom was Carter’s father, a vice president of the company,
and in which the Court entertained the suit and decided the case
on the merits.374
Substantial Interest: Standing
     Perhaps the most important element of the requirement of ad-
verse parties may be found in the “complexities and vagaries” of
the standing doctrine. “The fundamental aspect of standing is that
it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal
court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.” 375 The
“gist of the question of standing” is whether the party seeking re-
lief has “alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the contro-
versy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the
     369 157 U.S. 429 (1895). The first injunction suit by a stockholder to restrain a

corporation from paying a tax was apparently Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. (18 How.)
331 (1856). See also Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R., 240 U.S. 1 (1916).
     370 Cf. Cheatham v. United States, 92 U.S. 85 (1875); Snyder v. Marks, 109 U.S.

189 (1883).
     371 Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180 (1921).
     372 Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288 (1936). See id. at 341 (Justice Brandeis dis-

senting in part).

     374 Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 59 HARV. L. REV. 645,

667–668 (1948) (detailing the framing of the suit).
     375 Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99 (1968). This characterization is not the view

of the present Court; see Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, 752, 755–56, 759–61
(1984). In taxpayer suits, it is appropriate to look to the substantive issues to deter-
mine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated. Id. at 102; United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 174–75
(1974); Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 78–79 (1978).
