missed for want of jurisdiction.1178 “We are not at liberty to inquire
into the motives of the legislature. We can only examine into its
power under the Constitution; and the power to make exceptions
to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words.”
    “What, then, is the effect of the repealing act upon the case be-
fore us? We cannot doubt as to this. Without jurisdiction the court
cannot proceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to declare
the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to
the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.” 1179
Although McCardle grew out of the stresses of Reconstruction, the
principle it applied has been applied in later cases.1180
    Jurisdiction of the Inferior Federal Courts.—The Framers,
as we have seen,1181 divided with regard to the necessity of courts
inferior to the Supreme Court, simply authorized Congress to cre-

     1178 Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1869). In the course of the opin-

ion, Chief Justice Chase speculated about the Court’s power in the absence of any
legislation in tones reminiscent of Marshall’s comments. Id. at 513.

     1180 See, e.g., Justice Frankfurter’s remarks in National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tide-

water Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 582, 655 (1948) (dissenting): “Congress need not give
this Court any appellate power; it may withdraw appellate jurisdiction once con-
ferred and it may do so even while a case is sub judice.” In The Francis Wright, 105
U.S. 381, 385–386 (1882), upholding Congress’s power to confine Supreme Court re-
view in admiralty cases to questions of law, the Court said: “[W]hile the appellate
power of this court under the Constitution extends to all cases within the judicial
power of the United States, actual jurisdiction under the power is confined within
such limits as Congress sees fit to prescribe. . . . What those powers shall be, and
to what extent they shall be exercised, are, and always have been, proper subjects
of legislative control. Authority to limit the jurisdiction necessarily carries with it
authority to limit the use of the jurisdiction. Not only may whole classes of cases be
kept out of the jurisdiction altogether, but particular classes of questions may be
subjected to reexamination and review, while others are not.” See also Luckenbuch
S. S. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 533, 537 (1926); American Construction Co. v.
Jacksonville, T. & K.W. Ry., 148 U.S. 372, 378 (1893); United States v. Bitty, 208
U.S. 393 (1908); United States v. Young, 94 U.S. 258 (1876). Numerous restrictions
on the exercise of appellate jurisdiction have been upheld. E.g., Congress for a hun-
dred years did not provide for a right of appeal to the Supreme Court in criminal
cases, except upon a certification of division by the circuit court: at first appeal was
provided in capital cases and then in others. F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, supra at
79, 109–120. Other limitations noted heretofore include minimum jurisdictional amounts,
restrictions of review to questions of law and to questions certified from the circuits,
and the scope of review of state court decisions of federal constitutional questions.
See Walker v. Taylor, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 64 (1847). Though McCardle is the only case
in which Congress successfully forestalled an expected decision by shutting off juris-
diction, other cases have been cut off while pending on appeal, either inadvertently,
Insurance Co. v. Ritchie, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 541 (1866), or intentionally, Railroad Co.
v. Grant, 98 U.S. 398 (1878), by raising the requirements for jurisdiction without a
reservation for pending cases. See also Bruner v. United States, 343 U.S. 112 (1952);
District of Columbia v. Eslin, 183 U.S. 62 (1901).
