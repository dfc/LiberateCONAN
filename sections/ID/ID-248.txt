ing. However, one Townsend factor, not expressly set out in the stat-
ute, has been overturned in order to bring the case law into line
with other decisions. Townsend had held that a hearing was re-
quired if the material facts were not adequately developed at the
state-court hearing. If the defendant had failed to develop the ma-
terial facts in the state court, however, the Court held that, unless
he had “deliberately bypass[ed]” that procedural outlet, he was still
entitled to the hearing.1375 The Court overruled that point and sub-
stituted a much stricter “cause-and-prejudice” standard.1376
     Fourth, the Court has significantly stiffened the standards gov-
erning when a federal habeas court should entertain a second or
successive petition filed by a state prisoner—a question with which
Sanders v. United States dealt.1377 A successive petition may be dis-
missed if the same ground was determined adversely to petitioner
previously, the prior determination was on the merits, and “the ends
of justice” would not be served by reconsideration. It is with the
latter element that the Court has become more restrictive. A plural-
ity in Kuhlmann v. Wilson 1378 argued that the “ends of justice” stan-
dard would be met only if a petitioner supplemented her constitu-
tional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence. While
the Court has not expressly adopted this standard, a later capital
case utilized it, holding that a petitioner sentenced to death could
escape the bar on successive petitions by demonstrating “actual in-
nocence” of the death penalty by showing by clear and convincing
evidence that no reasonable juror would have found the prisoner
eligible for the death penalty under applicable state law.1379
    Even if the subsequent petition alleges new and different grounds,
a habeas court may dismiss the petition if the prisoner’s failure to
assert those grounds in the prior, or first, petition constitutes “an
abuse of the writ.” 1380 Following the 1963 trilogy and especially Sand-
ers, the federal courts had generally followed a rule excusing the
failure to raise claims in earlier petitions unless the failure was a
result of “inexcusable neglect” or of deliberate relinquishment. In

     1375 Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 313, 317 (1963), imported the “deliberate

bypass” standard from Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438 (1963).
     1376 Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1 (1992). This standard is imported from

the cases abandoning Fay v. Noia and is discussed infra.
     1377 373 U.S. 1, 15–18 (1963). The standards are embodied in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b).
     1378 477 U.S. 436 (1986).
     1379 Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333 (1992). Language in the opinion suggests

that the standard is not limited to capital cases. Id. at 339.
     1380 The standard is in 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b), along with the standard that, if a

petitioner “deliberately withheld” a claim, the petition can be dismissed. See also 28
U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 9(b) (judge may dismiss successive petition raising new claims if
failure to assert them previously was an abuse of the writ).
