Created in 1982,45 this court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear ap-
peals from the United States Court of Federal Claims, from the Fed-
eral Merit System Protection Board, the Court of International Trade,
the Patent Office in patent and trademark cases, and in various
contract and tort cases. One of those courts, the Court of Interna-
tional Trade, began life as the Board of General Appraisers, be-
came the United States Customs Court in 1926, was declared an
Article III court in 1956, and came to its present form and name in
1980.46 Finally, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, staffed
by federal judges from other courts, is authorized to transfer ac-
tions pending in different districts to a single district for trial.47
     To facilitate the gathering of foreign intelligence information,
through electronic surveillance, search and seizure, as well as other
means, Congress in 1978 authorized a special court, composed of
seven regular federal judges appointed by the Chief Justice, to re-
ceive applications from the United States and to issue warrants for
intelligence activities.48 Even greater specialization was provided by
the special court created by the Ethics in Government Act; 49 the
court was charged, upon the request of the Attorney General, with
appointing an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute charges
of illegality in the Executive Branch. The court also had certain su-
pervisory powers over the independent counsel.

Legislative Courts
    Legislative courts, so-called because they are created by Con-
gress pursuant to its general legislative powers, have comprised a
significant part of the federal judiciary.50 The distinction between
constitutional courts and legislative courts was first made in Ameri-
can Ins. Co. v. Canter,51 which involved the question of the admi-
ralty jurisdiction of the territorial court of Florida, the judges of

of Appeals for the District of Columbia; composed of three regular federal judges,
only one of whom may be from the D. C. Circuit, who are designated by the Chief
Justice. 28 U.S.C. § 49. The constitutionality of the Special Division was upheld in
