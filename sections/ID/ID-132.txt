premacy Clause, which makes the Constitution, laws enacted pur-
suant to the Constitution, and treaties the supreme law of the land,705
and which Congress effectuated by enacting § 25 of the Judiciary
Act of 1789.706 Five years before Marbury v. Madison, the Court
held invalid a state law as conflicting with the terms of a treaty,707
and seven years after Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion it voided a
state law as conflicting with the Constitution.708
    Virginia provided a states’ rights challenge to a broad reading
of the Supremacy Clause and to the validity of § 25 in Martin v.
Hunter’s Lessee 709 and in Cohens v. Virginia.710 In both cases, it
was argued that while the courts of Virginia were constitutionally
obliged to prefer “the supreme law of the land,” as set out in the
Supremacy Clause, over conflicting state constitutional provisions
and laws, it was only by their own interpretation of the supreme
law that they as courts of a sovereign state were bound. Further-

claiming such a right, from which it followed that “the judicial power
of the United States” did not “extend” to such cases unless they
were brought in the first instance in the courts of the United States.
But Chief Justice Marshall rejected this narrow interpretation: “A
case in law or equity consists of the right of the one party, as well
as of the other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitu-
tion or a law of the United States, whenever its correct decision
depends upon the construction of either.” 711 Passing on to the power
of the Supreme Court to review such decisions of the state courts,
he said: “Let the nature and objects of our Union be considered: let
the great fundamental principles on which the fabric stands, be ex-
amined: and we think, the result must be, that there is nothing so
extravagantly absurd, in giving to the Court of the nation the power
of revising the decisions of local tribunals, on questions which af-

think the United States would come to an end if we lost our power to declare an Act
of Congress void. I do think the Union would be imperiled if we could not make
that declaration as the laws of the several States.” O. HOLMES, COLLECTED LEGAL PA-
