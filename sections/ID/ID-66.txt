bring a case before it for decision.” 350 The meaning attached to the
terms “cases” and “controversies” 351 determines therefore the ex-
tent of the judicial power as well as the capacity of the federal courts
to receive jurisdiction. According to Chief Justice Marshall, judicial
power is capable of acting only when the subject is submitted in a
case and a case arises only when a party asserts his rights “in a
form prescribed by law.” 352 “By cases and controversies are in-
tended the claims of litigants brought before the courts for determi-
nation by such regular proceedings as are established by law or cus-
tom for the protection or enforcement of rights, or the prevention,
redress, or punishment of wrongs. Whenever the claim of a party
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States takes
such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon it,
then it has become a case. The term implies the existence of pres-
ent or possible adverse parties whose contentions are submitted to
the Court for adjudication.” 353
     Chief Justice Hughes once essayed a definition, which, how-
ever, presents a substantial problem of labels. “A ‘controversy’ in
this sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial determina-
tion. A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a differ-
ence or dispute of a hypothetical character; from one that is aca-
demic or moot. The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching
the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. It must
be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief
through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from
an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state
of facts.” 354 Of the “case” and “controversy” requirement, Chief Jus-
tice Warren admitted that “those two words have an iceberg qual-
ity, containing beneath their surface simplicity submerged complexi-
ties which go to the very heart of our constitutional form of
government. Embodied in the words ‘cases’ and ‘controversies’ are
two complementary but somewhat different limitations. In part those
words limit the business of federal courts to questions presented in
an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable
of resolution through the judicial process. And in part those words
define the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of

    351  The two terms may be used interchangeably, inasmuch as a “controversy,” if
distinguishable from a “case” at all, is so only because it is a less comprehensive
word and includes only suits of a civil nature. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300
