intermediate appellate court or even a trial court if its judgment is
final under state law and cannot be reviewed by any state appel-
late court.825 The review is of a final judgment below. “It must be
subject to no further review or correction in any other state tribu-
nal; it must also be final as an effective determination of the litiga-
tion and not of merely interlocutory or intermediate steps therein.
It must be the final word of a final court.”T 826 The object of this
rule is to avoid piecemeal interference with state court proceed-
ings; it promotes harmony by preventing federal assumption of a
role in a controversy until the state court efforts are finally re-
solved.827 For similar reasons, the Court requires that a party seek-
ing to litigate a federal constitutional issue on appeal of a state court
judgment must have raised that issue with sufficient precision to
have enabled the state court to have considered it and she must
have raised the issue at the appropriate time below.828
    When the judgment of a state court rests on an adequate, inde-
pendent determination of state law, the Court will not review the
resolution of the federal questions decided, even though the resolu-
tion may be in error.829 “The reason is so obvious that it has rarely
been thought to warrant statement. It is found in the partitioning
of power between the state and Federal judicial systems and in the
limitations of our own jurisdiction. Our only power over state judg-
ments is to correct them to the extent that they incorrectly ad-
judge federal rights. And our power is to correct wrong judgments,
not to revise opinions. We are not permitted to render an advisory
opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state
