on foreign affairs and foreign policy political questions,632 whether
the courts can adjudicate a dispute in this area has often depended
on the context in which it arises. Thus, the determination by the
President whether to recognize the government of a foreign state 633
or who is the de jure or de facto ruler of a foreign state 634 is conclu-
sive on the courts. In the absence of a definitive executive action,
however, the courts will review the record to determine whether the
United States has accorded a sufficient degree of recognition to al-
low the courts to take judicial notice of the existence of the state.635
Moreover, the courts have often determined for themselves what ef-
fect, if any, should be accorded the acts of foreign powers, recog-
nized or unrecognized.636
     3. Treaties. Similarly, the Court, when dealing with treaties and
the treaty power, has treated as political questions whether the for-
eign party had constitutional authority to assume a particular obli-
gation 637 and whether a treaty has lapsed because of the foreign
state’s loss of independence 638 or because of changes in the territo-
rial sovereignty of the foreign state.639 On the other hand, the Court
will not only interpret the domestic effects of treaties,640 but it will
at times interpret the effects bearing on international matters.641
