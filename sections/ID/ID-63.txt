       it is the duty of the Court to exercise and regulate it by a sound
       and just judicial discretion, whereby the rights and independence
       of the bar may be as scrupulously guarded and maintained by the
       Court, as the right and dignity of the Court itself.” 338 The Test-
       Oath Act of July 2, 1862, which purported to exclude former Con-
       federates from the practice of law in the federal courts, was invali-
       dated in Ex parte Garland.339 In the course of his opinion for the
       Court, Justice Field discussed generally the power to admit and dis-
       bar attorneys. The exercise of such a power, he declared, is judicial
       power. The attorney is an officer of the court, and though Congress
       may prescribe qualifications for the practice of law in the federal
       courts, it may not do so in such a way as to inflict punishment con-
       trary to the Constitution or to deprive a pardon of the President of
       its legal effect.340

    SECTION 2. Clause 1. The Judicial Power shall extend to all
Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the
Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall
be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambas-
sadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of ad-
miralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the
United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two
or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State;
           338 Ex parte Secombe, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 9, 13 (1857). In Frazier v. Heebe, 482

       U.S. 641 (1987), the Court exercised its supervisory power to invalidate a district
       court rule respecting the admission of attorneys. See In re Sawyer, 360 U.S. 622
       (1959), with reference to the extent to which counsel of record during a pending
       case may attribute error to the judiciary without being subject to professional disci-
       pline.
           339 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1867).
           340 71 U.S. at 378–80. Although a lawyer is admitted to practice in a federal

       court by way of admission to practice in a state court, he is not automatically sent
       out of the federal court by the same route, when “principles of right and justice”
       require otherwise. A determination of a state court that an accused practitioner should
       be disbarred is not conclusively binding on the federal courts. Theard v. United States,
       354 U.S. 278 (1957), citing Selling v. Radford, 243 U.S. 46 (1917). Cf. In re Isser-
       man, 345 U.S. 286, 288 (1953), where it was acknowledged that upon disbarment
       by a state court, Rule 2, par. 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court imposes upon the
       attorney the burden of showing cause why he should not be disbarred in the latter,
       and upon his failure to meet that burden, the Supreme Court will “follow the find-
       ing of the state that the character requisite for membership in the bar is lacking.”
       In 348 U.S. 1 (1954), Isserman’s disbarment was set aside for reason of noncompli-
       ance with Rule 8 requiring concurrence of a majority of the Justices participating in
       order to sustain a disbarment. See also In re Disbarment of Crow, 359 U.S. 1007
       (1959). For an extensive treatment of disbarment and American and English prec-
       edents thereon, see Ex parte Wall, 107 U.S. 265 (1883).
