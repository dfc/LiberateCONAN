or otherwise,” that was arguably within the zone of interest to be
protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional provision in
question.405 Political,406 environmental, aesthetic, and social inter-
ests, when impaired, now afford a basis for making constitutional
attacks upon governmental action.407 “But deprivation of a proce-
dural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the
deprivation—a procedural right in vacuo—is insufficient to create
Article III standing.” 408
     The breadth of the “injury-in-fact” concept may be discerned in
a series of cases involving the right of private parties to bring ac-
tions under the Fair Housing Act to challenge alleged discrimina-
tory practices, even where discriminatory action was not directed
against parties to a suit. These cases held that the subjective and
intangible interests of enjoying the benefits of living in integrated
communities were sufficient to permit them to attack actions that
threatened or harmed those interests.409 Or, there is the important
case of FEC v. Akins,410 which addresses the ability of Congress to
confer standing and to remove prudential constraints on judicial re-
view. Congress had afforded persons access to Commission informa-
tion and had authorized “any person aggrieved” by the actions of
the FEC to sue. The Court found “injury-in-fact” present where plain-
tiff voters alleged that the Federal Election Commission had de-
     405 Ass’n of Data Processing Service Org. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970); Barlow

v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159 (1970). The “zone of interest” test is a prudential rather
than constitutional standard. The Court sometimes uses other language to charac-
terize this test. Thus, in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992),
the Court refers to injury in fact as “an invasion of a legally protected interest,” but
in context, here and in the cases cited, it is clear the reference is to any interest
that the Court finds protectable under the Constitution, statutes, or regulations.

crete injury). On the other hand, where a party has successfully established a legal
right, a threat to the enforcement of that legal right gives rise to a separate legal
injury. Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–472, slip op. at 8 (2010) (plurality
