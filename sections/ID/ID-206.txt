       those considerations of public policy back of the rule are regarded
       as absent in the case of the foreign sovereign.1145
           Indian Tribes.—Within the terms of Article III, an Indian tribe
       is not a foreign state and hence cannot sue in the courts of the United
       States. This rule was applied in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,1146 where
       Chief Justice Marshall conceded that the Cherokee Nation was a
       state, but not a foreign state, being a part of the United States and
       dependent upon it. Other passages of the opinion specify the ele-
       ments essential of a foreign state for purposes of jurisdiction, such
       as sovereignty and independence.
           Narrow Construction of the Jurisdiction.—As in cases of di-
       versity jurisdiction, suits brought to the federal courts under this
       category must clearly state in the record the nature of the parties.
       As early as 1809, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal court could
       not take jurisdiction of a cause where the defendants were de-
       scribed in the record as “late of the district of Maryland,” but were
       not designated as citizens of Maryland, and plaintiffs were de-
       scribed as aliens and subjects of the United Kingdom.1147 The me-
       ticulous care manifested in this case appeared twenty years later
       when the Court narrowly construed § 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
       vesting the federal courts with jurisdiction when an alien was a party,
       in order to keep it within the limits of this clause. The judicial power
       was further held not to extend to private suits in which an alien is
       a party, unless a citizen is the adverse party.1148 This interpreta-
       tion was extended in 1870 by a holding that if there is more than
       one plaintiff or defendant, each plaintiff or defendant must be com-
       petent to sue or liable to suit.1149 These rules, however, do not pre-
       clude a suit between citizens of the same state if the plaintiffs are
       merely nominal parties and are suing on behalf of an alien.1150

    Clause 2. In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public
Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a
Party, the Supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all

       precedents to the effect that a sovereign plaintiff “should be put in the same posi-
       tion as a body corporate.”

       sagne v. Chapuis, 144 U.S. 119 (1892), which held that a lower federal court had
       jurisdiction over a proceeding to impeach its former decree, although the parties were
       new and were both aliens.
