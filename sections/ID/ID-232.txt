But when a litigant is suing for protection of federally guaranteed
civil rights, he need not exhaust any kind of state remedy.1289
     Anti-Injunction Statute.—For reasons unknown,1290 Con-
gress in 1793 enacted a statute to prohibit the issuance of injunc-
tions by federal courts to stay state court proceedings.1291 Over time,
a long list of exceptions to the statutory bar was created by judicial
decision,1292 but in Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co.,1293 the Court
in a lengthy opinion by Justice Frankfurter announced a very lib-
eral interpretation of the anti-injunction statute so as to do away
with practically all the exceptions that had been created. Con-
gress’s response was to redraft the statute and to indicate that it
was restoring the pre-Toucey interpretation.1294 Considerable dis-
agreement exists over the application of the statute, however, espe-
cially with regard to the exceptions it permits. The present ten-
dency appears to be to read the law expansively and the exceptions
restrictively in the interest of preventing conflict with state courts.1295
Nonetheless, some exceptions exist, either expressly or implicitly
