the Justices declined a request of President Washington to tender
him advice respecting legal issues growing out of United States neu-
trality between England and France in 1793.345 Moreover, the re-
fusal of the Justices to participate in a congressional plan for award-
ing veterans’ pensions 346 bespoke a similar adherence to the restricted
role of courts. These restrictions have been encapsulated in a se-
ries of principles or doctrines, the application of which determines
whether an issue is met for judicial resolution and whether the par-
ties raising it are entitled to have it judicially resolved. Constitu-
tional restrictions are intertwined with prudential considerations in
the expression of these principles and doctrines, and it is seldom
easy to separate out the two strands.347

The Two Classes of Cases and Controversies
    By the terms of the foregoing section, the judicial power ex-
tends to nine classes of cases and controversies, which fall into two
general groups. In the words of Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens
v. Virginia: 348 “In the first, jurisdiction depends on the character of
the cause, whoever may be the parties. This class comprehends ‘all
cases in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of
the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, un-
der their authority.’ This cause extends the jurisdiction of the court
to all the cases described, without making in its terms any excep-
tion whatever, and without any regard to the condition of the party.
If there be any exception, it is to be implied, against the express
words of the article. In the second class, the jurisdiction depends
entirely on the character of the parties. In this are comprehended
‘controversies between two or more states, between a state and citi-
zens of another state,’ and ‘between a state and foreign states, citi-
zens or subjects.’ If these be the parties, it is entirely unimportant,
what may be the subject of controversy. Be it what it may, these
parties have a constitutional right to come into the courts of the
Union.” 349
    Judicial power is “the power of a court to decide and pronounce
a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who
