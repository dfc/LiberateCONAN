thorized to establish.” 521 Finding that the case presented a definite
and concrete controversy, the Court held that a declaration should
have been issued.522
    The Court has insisted that “the requirements for a justiciable
case or controversy are no less strict in a declaratory judgment pro-
ceeding than in any other type of suit.” 523 As Justice Douglas wrote:
“The difference between an abstract question and a ‘controversy’ con-
templated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of
degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion
a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such
a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether the
facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a sub-
stantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal inter-
ests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of
a declaratory judgment.” 524 It remains, therefore, for the courts to
determine in each case the degree of controversy necessary to estab-
lish a case for purposes of jurisdiction. Even then, however, the Court
is under no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction.525 Use of declara-
tory judgments to settle disputes and identify rights in many pri-
vate areas, like insurance and patents in particular but extending
into all areas of civil litigation, except taxes,526 is common. The Court
has, however, at various times demonstrated a substantial reluc-
tance to have important questions of public law, especially regard-
ing the validity of legislation, resolved by such a procedure.527 In
part, this has been accomplished by a strict insistence upon con-

     526 An exception “with respect to Federal taxes” was added in 1935. 49 Stat.

1027. The Tax Injunction Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 738, U.S.C. § 1341, prohibited federal
injunctive relief directed at state taxes but said nothing about declaratory relief. It
was held to apply, however, in California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393
(1982). Earlier, in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293 (1943),
the Court had reserved the issue but held that considerations of comity should pre-
clude federal courts from giving declaratory relief in such cases. Cf. Fair Assess-
ment in Real Estate Ass’n v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100 (1981).
