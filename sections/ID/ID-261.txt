Doubtful State of the Law of Treason Today
     The vacillation of Chief Justice Marshall between the Boll-
man 1434 and Burr 1435 cases and the vacillation of the Court in the
Cramer 1436 and Haupt 1437 cases leave the law of treason in a some-
what doubtful condition. The difficulties created by Burr have been
obviated to a considerable extent through the punishment of acts
ordinarily treasonable in nature under a different label,1438 within
a formula provided by Chief Justice Marshall himself in Bollman.
The passage reads: “Crimes so atrocious as those which have for
their object the subversion by violence of those laws and those in-
stitutions which have been ordained in order to secure the peace
and happiness of society, are not to escape punishment, because they
have not ripened into treason. The wisdom of the legislature is com-
petent to provide for the case; and the framers of our Constitution
. . . must have conceived it more safe that punishment in such cases
should be ordained by general laws, formed upon deliberation, un-
der the influence of no resentments, and without knowing on whom
they were to operate, than that it should be inflicted under the in-
fluence of those passions which the occasion seldom fails to excite,
and which a flexible definition of the crime, or a construction which
would render it flexible, might bring into operation.” 1439

he was consistently demonstrating his allegiance to Japan. “As a matter of law, he

pended to his opinion in Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1, 25 n.38 (1945), a list
taken from the government’s brief of all the cases prior to Cramer in which construc-
tion of the Treason Clause was involved. The same list, updated, appears in J. Hurst,
supra at 260–67. Professor Hurst was responsible for the historical research under-
lying the government’s brief in Cramer.
