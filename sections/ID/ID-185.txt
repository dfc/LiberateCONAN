complainant state must show that it “has suffered a wrong through
the action of the other State, furnishing ground for judicial re-
dress, or is asserting a right against the other State which is sus-
ceptible of judicial enforcement according to . . . the common law
or equity systems of jurisprudence.” 1017 The fact that the trust prop-
erty was sufficient to satisfy the claims of both states and that re-
covery by either would not impair any rights of the other distin-
guished the case from Texas v. Florida,1018 where the contrary situation
obtained. Furthermore, the Missouri statute providing for recipro-
cal privileges in levying inheritance taxes did not confer upon Mas-
sachusetts any contractual right. The Court then proceeded to reit-
erate its earlier rule that a state may not invoke the original
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the benefit of its residents or
to enforce the individual rights of its citizens.1019 Moreover, Massa-
chusetts could not invoke the original jurisdiction of the Court by
the expedient of making citizens of Missouri parties to a suit not
otherwise maintainable.1020 Accordingly, Massachusetts was held not
to be without an adequate remedy in Missouri’s courts or in a fed-
eral district court in Missouri.
    The Problem of Enforcement: Virginia v. West Vir-
ginia.—A very important issue in interstate litigation is the enforce-
ment of the Court’s decree, once it has been entered. In some types
of suits, this issue may not arise, and if it does, it may be easily
met. Thus, a judgment putting a state in possession of disputed ter-
ritory is ordinarily self-executing. But if the losing state should op-
pose execution, refractory state officials, as individuals, would be
liable to civil suits or criminal prosecutions in the federal courts.
Likewise an injunction may be enforced against state officials as
individuals by civil or criminal proceedings. Those judgments, on
the other hand, that require a state in its governmental capacity to
perform some positive act present the issue of enforcement in more
serious form. The issue arose directly in the long and much liti-
gated case between Virginia and West Virginia over the proportion
of the state debt of original Virginia owed by West Virginia after
its separate admission to the Union under a compact which pro-
vided that West Virginia assume a share of the debt.

that a state cannot sue another to prevent maladministration of quarantine laws.
