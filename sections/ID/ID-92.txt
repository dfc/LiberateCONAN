a truncated version of) Coleman v. Miller,481 in which the Court had
found that 20 of the 40 members of a state legislature had stand-
ing to sue to challenge the loss of the effectiveness of their votes as
a result of a tie-breaker by the lieutenant governor. Although there
are several possible explanations for the result in that case, the Court
in Raines chose to fasten on a particularly narrow point. “[O]ur hold-
ing in Coleman stands (at most . . .) for the proposition that legis-
lators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact) a
specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legislative ac-
tion goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on the ground that
their votes have been completely nullified.” 482 Because these Mem-
bers could still pass or reject appropriations bills, vote to repeal the
Act, or exempt any appropriations bill from presidential cancella-
tion, the Act did not nullify their votes and thus give them stand-
ing.483
     It may be observed that the Court’s two holdings do not cohere.
If legislators have standing only to allege personal injuries suffered
in their personal capacities, how can they have standing to assert
official-capacity injury in being totally deprived of the effectiveness
of their votes?
    Standing to Challenge Lawfulness of Governmental Ac-
tion.—Standing to challenge governmental action on statutory or
other non-constitutional grounds has a constitutional content to the
degree that Article III requires a “case” or “controversy,” necessitat-
ing a litigant who has sustained or will sustain an injury so that
he will be moved to present the issue “in an adversary context and
in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.” 484
Liberalization of standing in the administrative law field has been
notable.
    The “old law” required that in order to sue to contest the law-
fulness of agency administrative action, one must have suffered a
“legal wrong,” that is, “the right invaded must be a legal right,” 485
requiring some resolution of the merits preliminarily. An injury-in-
fact was insufficient. A “legal right” could be established in one of

justiciable, the question whether the litigant is a ‘proper party to request an adjudi-
cation of a particular issue,’ [quoting Flast, supra, at 100], is one within the power
of Congress to determine.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 n.3 (1972).
