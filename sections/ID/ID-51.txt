     Habeas Corpus: Congressional and Judicial Control.—
The writ of habeas corpus 261 has a special status because its sus-
pension is forbidden, except in narrow circumstances, by Article I,
§ 9, cl. 2. The writ also has a venerable common law tradition, long
antedating its recognition by the first Congress in the Judiciary Act
of 1789,262 as a means “to relieve detention by executive authori-
ties without judicial trial.” 263 Nowhere in the Constitution, how-
ever, is the power to issue the writ vested in the federal courts,
which raises the question of whether Congress could suspend the
writ de facto by declining to authorize its issuance. In other words,
is a statute needed to make the writ available or does the right to
habeas corpus stem by implication from the Suspension Clause or
from the grant of judicial power? 264
    Since Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion in Ex parte Bollman,265
it was generally 266 accepted that “the power to award the writ by
any of the courts of the United States, must be given by written
law.” 267 As Marshall explained, however, the suspension clause was
an “injunction,” an “obligation” to provide “efficient means by which
this great constitutional privilege should receive life and activity;
for if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself would be
lost, although no law for its suspension should be enacted.” 268 And

     261 Reference to the “writ of habeas corpus” is to the “Great Writ,” habeas cor-

pus ad subjiciendum, by which a court would inquire into the lawfulness of a deten-
tion of the petitioner. Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75, 95 (1807). For other uses,
see Carbo v. United States, 364 U.S. 611 (1961); Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266
(1948). Technically, federal prisoners no longer utilize the writ of habeas corpus in
seeking post-conviction relief, now the largest office of the writ, but proceed under
28 U.S.C. § 2255, on a motion to vacate judgment. Intimating that if § 2255 af-
forded prisoners a less adequate remedy than they would have under habeas cor-
pus, it would be unconstitutional, the Court in United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S.
205 (1952), held the two remedies to be equivalent. Cf. Sanders v. United States,
373 U.S. 1, 14 (1963). The claims cognizable under one are cognizable under the
other. Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217 (1969). Therefore, the term habeas
corpus is used here to include the § 2255 remedy. There is a plethora of writings
about the writ. See, e.g., Hart & Wechsler (6th ed), supra at 1153–1310; Develop-
ments in the Law: Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 HARV. L. REV. 1038 (1970).

     264 Professor Chafee contended that by the time of the Constitutional Conven-

tion the right to habeas corpus was so well established no affirmative authorization
was needed. The Most Important Human Right in the Constitution, 32 B.U.L. REV.
143, 146 (1952). But compare Collins, Habeas Corpus for Convicts: Constitutional
Right or Legislative Grace?, 40 CALIF. L. REV. 335, 344–345 (1952).
     265 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75 (1807).
     266 8 U.S. at 94. See also Ex parte Dorr, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 103 (1845).
     267 8 U.S. at 64.
     268 8 U.S. at 95. In quoting the clause, Marshall renders “shall not be sus-

pended” as “should not be suspended.”
