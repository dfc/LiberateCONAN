     Suits by Foreign States.—The privilege of a recognized for-
eign state to sue in the courts of another state upon the principle
of comity is recognized by both international law and American con-
stitutional law.1139 To deny a sovereign this privilege “would mani-
fest a want of comity and friendly feeling.” 1140 Although national
sovereignty is continuous, a suit in behalf of a national sovereign
can be maintained in the courts of the United States only by a gov-
ernment which has been recognized by the political branches of our
own government as the authorized government of the foreign state.1141
As the responsible agency for the conduct of foreign affairs, the State
Department is the normal means of suggesting to the courts that a
sovereign be granted immunity from a particular suit.1142 Once a
foreign government avails itself of the privilege of suing in the courts
of the United States, it subjects itself to the procedure and rules of
decision governing those courts and accepts whatever liabilities the
court may decide to be a reasonable incident of bringing the suit.1143
The rule that a foreign nation instituting a suit in a federal dis-
trict court cannot invoke sovereign immunity as a defense to a coun-
terclaim growing out of the same transaction has been extended to
deny a claim of immunity as a defense to a counterclaim extrinsic
to the subject matter of the suit but limited to the amount of the
sovereign’s claim.1144 Moreover, certain of the benefits extending to
a domestic sovereign do not extend to a foreign sovereign suing in
the courts of the United States. A foreign state does not receive the
benefit of the rule which exempts the United States and its mem-
ber states from the operation of the statute of limitations, because

    1140  78 U.S. at 167. This case also held that a change in the person of the sover-
eign does not affect the continuity or rights of national sovereignty, including the
right to bring suit or to continue one that has been brought.
     1141 Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U.S. 126, 137 (1938), citing Jones

v. United States, 137 U.S. 202, 212 (1890); Matter of Lehigh Valley R.R., 265 U.S.
573 (1924). Whether a government is to be regarded as the legal representative of a
foreign state is, of course, a political question.
     1142 Ex parte Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 589 (1943), distinguishing Compania Espanola

v. The Navemar, 303 U.S. 68 (1938), which held that where the Executive Depart-
ment neither recognizes nor disallows the claim of immunity, the court is free to
examine that question for itself. Under the latter circumstances, however, a claim
that a foreign vessel is a public ship and immune from suit must be substantiated
to the satisfaction of the federal court.
     1143 Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U.S. 126, 134 (1938). Among other

benefits which the Court cited as not extending to foreign states as litigant included
exemption from costs and from giving discovery. Decisions were also cited to the
effect that a sovereign plaintiff “should so far as the thing can be done, be put in
the same position as a body corporate.”
     1144 National Bank v. Republic of China, 348 U.S. 356, 361 (1955), citing 26 Dept.

State Bull. 984 (1952), in which the Department “pronounced broadly against recog-
nizing sovereign immunity for the commercial operations of a foreign government.”
