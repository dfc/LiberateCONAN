courts provided for removal of such cases by either party, subject
only to the jurisdictional amount limitation.776 The present statute
provides for the removal by a defendant of any civil action which
could have been brought originally in a federal district court, with
no diversity of citizenship required in “federal question” cases.777 A
special civil rights removal statute permits removal of any civil or
criminal action by a defendant who is denied or cannot enforce in
the state court a right under any law providing for equal civil rights
of persons or who is being proceeded against for any act under color
of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights.778
    The constitutionality of removal statutes was challenged and read-
ily sustained. Justice Story analogized removal to a form of exer-
cise of appellate jurisdiction,779 and a later Court saw it as an indi-
rect mode of exercising original jurisdiction and upheld its
constitutionality.780 In Tennessee v. Davis,781 which involved a state
attempt to prosecute a federal internal revenue agent who had killed
a man while seeking to seize an illicit distilling apparatus, the Court
invoked the right of the national government to defend itself against
state harassment and restraint. The power to provide for removal
was discerned in the Necessary and Proper Clause authorization to
Congress to pass laws to carry into execution the powers vested in
any other department or officer, here the judiciary.782 The judicial
power of the United States, said the Court, embraces alike civil and
criminal cases arising under the Constitution and laws and the power
asserted in civil cases may be asserted in criminal cases. A case
arising under the Constitution and laws “is not merely one where
a party comes into court to demand something conferred upon him
by the Constitution or by a law or treaty. A case consists of the
right of one party as well as the other, and may truly be said to
arise under the Constitution or a law or a treaty of the United States
whenever its correct decision depends upon the construction of ei-
ther. Cases arising under the laws of the United States are such as
grow out of the legislation of Congress, whether they constitute the

     776 Act of March 3, 1875, § 2, 18 Stat. 471. The present pattern of removal juris-

diction was established by the Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, as amended, 25
Stat. 433.
     777 28 U.S.C. § 1441.
     778 28 U.S.C. § 1443.
     779 Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 347–351 (1816). Story

was not here concerned with the constitutionality of removal but with the constitu-
tionality of Supreme Court review of state judgments.
     780 Chicago & N.W. Ry. v. Whitton’s Administrator, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 270 (1872).

Removal here was based on diversity of citizenship. See also The Moses Taylor, 71
U.S. (4 Wall.) 411, 429–430 (1867); The Mayor v. Cooper, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 247 (1868).
