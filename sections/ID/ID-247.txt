and that he cannot raise those claims again in a habeas peti-
tion.1368 Grounded as it is in the Court’s dissatisfaction with the
exclusionary rule, the case has not since been extended to other con-
stitutional grounds,1369 but the rationale of the opinion suggests the
likelihood of reaching other exclusion questions.1370
    Second, the Court has formulated a “new rule” exception to ha-
beas cognizance. That is, subject to two exceptions,1371 a case de-
cided after a petitioner’s conviction and sentence became final may
not be the predicate for federal habeas relief if the case announces
or applies a “new rule.” 1372 A decision announces a new rule “if the
result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defen-
dant’s conviction became final.” 1373 If a rule “was susceptible to de-
bate among reasonable minds,” it could not have been dictated by
precedent, and therefore it must be classified as a “new rule.” 1374
    Third, the Court has largely maintained the standards of Townsend
v. Sain, as embodied in somewhat modified form in statute, with
respect to when federal judges must conduct an evidentiary hear-
     1368 Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976). The decision is based as much on the

Court’s dissatisfaction with the exclusionary rule as with its desire to curb habeas.
Holding that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unconstitutional searches
and seizures rather than to redress individual injuries, the Court reasoned that no
deterrent purpose was advanced by applying the rule on habeas, except to encour-
age state courts to give claimants a full and fair hearing. Id. at 493–95.
     1369 Stone does not apply to a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance

of counsel in litigating a search and seizure claim. Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S.
365, 382–383 (1986). See also Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545 (1979) (racial discrimi-
nation in selection of grand jury foreman); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979)
(insufficient evidence to satisfy reasonable doubt standard).
     1370 Issues of admissibility of confessions (Miranda violations) and eyewitness

identifications are obvious candidates. See, e.g., Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U.S. 195,
205 (1989) (Justice O’Connor concurring); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 413–14
(1977) (Justice Powell concurring), and id. at 415 (Chief Justice Burger dissenting);
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87 n.11 (1977) (reserving Miranda).
     1371 The first exception permits the retroactive application on habeas of a new

rule if the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the state to
proscribe or addresses a substantive categorical guarantee accorded by the Constitu-
tion. The rule must, to say it differently, either decriminalize a class of conduct or
prohibit the imposition of a particular punishment on a particular class of persons.
The second exception would permit the application of “watershed rules of criminal
procedure” implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal pro-
ceeding. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 494–95 (1990) (citing cases); Sawyer v. Smith,
497 U.S. 227, 241–45 (1990).
     1372 Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion); Penry v. Lynaugh,

492 U.S. 302, 313–19 (1989).
     1373 Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 412 (1990) (quoting Penry v. Lynaugh,

492 U.S. 302, 314 (1989), which was quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 314 (1989).
This sentence was quoted again in Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007)).
     1374 494 U.S. at 415. See also Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222, 228–29 (1992).

This latter case found that two decisions relied on by petitioner merely drew on ex-
isting precedent and so did not establish a new rule. See also O’Dell v. Netherland,
521 U.S. 151 (1997); Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U.S. 518 (1997); Gray v. Netherland,
518 U.S. 152 (1996). But compare Bousley v. Brooks, 523 U.S. 614 (1998).
