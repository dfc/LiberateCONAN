States,945 a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act for recovery for
a death by drowning in a navigable Oregon river of an employee of
a contractor engaged in repairing the federally owned Bonneville
Dam, a divided Court held that liability was to be measured by the
standard of care expressed in state law, notwithstanding that the
standard was higher than that required by maritime law. One area
existed, however, in which beneficiaries of a deceased seaman were
denied recovery.
    The Jones Act provided a remedy for wrongful death resulting
from negligence, but not for one caused by unseaworthiness alone;
in Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp.,946 the Court held that the
survivors of a seaman drowned while working on a ship docked in
an Ohio port could not recover under the state wrongful death stat-
ute even though the act recognized unseaworthiness as a basis for
recovery, the Jones Act having superseded state laws.
    Thus did matters stand until 1970, when the Court, in a unani-
mous opinion in Moragne v. States Marine Lines,947 overruled its
earlier cases and held that a right of recovery for wrongful death is
sanctioned by general maritime law and that no statute is needed
to bring the right into being. The Court was careful to note that
the cause of action created in Moragne would not, like the state
wrongful death statutes in Gillespie, be held precluded by the Jones
Act, so that the survivor of a seaman killed in navigable waters
within a state would have a cause of action for negligence under
the Jones Act or for unseaworthiness under the general maritime
law.948

     945 361 U.S. 314 (1960). The four Tungus dissenters joined two of the Tungus

majority solely “under compulsion” of the Tungus ruling; the other three majority
Justices dissented on the ground that application of the state statute unacceptably
disrupted the uniformity of maritime law.
     946 379 U.S. 148 (1964). The decision was based on dictum in Lindgren v. United

States, 281 U.S. 38 (1930), to the effect that the Jones Act remedy was exclusive.
     947 398 U.S. 375 (1970).
     948 398 U.S. at 396 n.12. For development of the law under Moragne, see Sea-

Land Services v. Gaudet, 414 U.S. 573 (1974); Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S.
19 (1990); and Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. v. Garris, 532 U.S. 811 (2001)
(maritime cause of action for death caused by violation of the duty of seaworthiness
is equally applicable to death resulting from negligence). But, in Yamaha Motor Corp.
v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199 (1996), a case involving a death in territorial waters from
a jet ski accident, the Court held that Moragne does not provide the exclusive rem-
edy in cases involving the death in territorial waters of a “nonseafarer”—a person
who is neither a seaman covered by the Jones Act nor a longshore worker covered
by the LHWCA.
