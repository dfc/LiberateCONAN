controversies than that in cases between private parties.1028 This it
does by holding rigorously to the rule that all the party defendants
be citizens of other states 1029 and by adhering to congressional dis-
tribution of its original jurisdiction concurrently with that of other
federal courts.1030
     Jurisdiction Confined to Civil Cases.—In Cohens v. Vir-
ginia,1031 there is a dictum to the effect that the original jurisdic-
tion of the Supreme Court does not include suits between a state
and its own citizens. Long afterwards, the Supreme Court dis-
missed an action for want of jurisdiction because the record did not
show that the corporation against which the suit was brought was
chartered in another state.1032 Subsequently, the Court has ruled
that it will not entertain an action by a state to which its citizens
are either parties of record or would have to be joined because of
the effect of a judgment upon them.1033 In his dictum in Cohens v.
Virginia, Chief Justice Marshall also indicated that perhaps no ju-
risdiction existed over suits by states to enforce their penal laws.1034
Sixty-seven years later, the Court wrote this dictum into law in Wis-
consin v. Pelican Ins. Co.1035 Wisconsin sued a Louisiana corpora-
tion to recover a judgment rendered in its favor by one of its own
courts. Relying partly on the rule of international law that the courts
of no country execute the penal laws of another, partly upon the
13th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which vested the Su-
preme Court with exclusive jurisdiction of controversies of a civil
nature where a state is a party, and partly on Justice Iredell’s dis-
sent in Chisholm v. Georgia,1036 where he confined the term “contro-
versies” to civil suits, Justice Gray ruled for the Court that for pur-
poses of original jurisdiction, “controversies between a State and
citizens of another State” are confined to civil suits.1037
    The State’s Real Interest.—Ordinarily, a state may not sue
in its name unless it is the real party in interest with real inter-
