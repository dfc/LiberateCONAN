position of a case, notwithstanding that other non-federal ques-
tions of fact and law may be involved therein.807 “Pendent jurisdiction,”
as this form is commonly called, exists whenever the state and fed-
eral claims “derive from a common nucleus of operative fact” and
are such that a plaintiff “would ordinarily be expected to try them
all in one judicial proceeding.” 808 Ordinarily, it is a rule of pru-
dence that federal courts should not pass on federal constitutional
claims if they may avoid it and should rest their conclusions upon
principles of state law where possible.809 But the federal court has
discretion whether to hear the pendent state claims in the proper
case. Thus, the trial court should look to “considerations of judicial
economy, convenience and fairness to litigants” in exercising its dis-
cretion and should avoid needless decisions of state law. If the fed-
eral claim, though substantial enough to confer jurisdiction, was dis-
missed before trial, or if the state claim substantially predominated,
the court would be justified in dismissing the state claim.810
    A variant of pendent jurisdiction, sometimes called “ancillary
jurisdiction,” is the doctrine allowing federal courts to acquire juris-
diction entirely of a case presenting two federal issues, although it
might properly not have had jurisdiction of one of the issues if it
had been independently presented.811 Thus, in an action under a
federal statute, a compulsory counterclaim not involving a federal
question is properly before the court and should be decided.812 The
concept has been applied to a claim otherwise cognizable only in
admiralty when joined with a related claim on the law side of the
federal court, and in this way to give an injured seaman a right to
jury trial on all of his claims when ordinarily the claim cognizable

Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 245–46 (1933). See also Kokkonen v. Guardian Life
Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375 (1994); Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349 (1996) (both cases
using the new vernacular of “ancillary jurisdiction”).

550 (1974). In fact, it may be an abuse of discretion for a federal court to fail to
decide on an available state law ground instead of reaching the federal constitu-
tional question. Schmidt v. Oakland Unified School Dist., 457 U.S. 594 (1982) (per
curiam). However, narrowing previous law, the Court held in Pennhurst State School
& Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), held that, when a pendent claim of state
law involves a claim that is against a state for purposes of the Eleventh Amend-
ment, federal courts may not adjudicate it.
