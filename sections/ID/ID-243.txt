which if proved would entitle him to relief, to relitigate facts, to
receive evidence and try the facts anew, and sought to lay down
broad guidelines as to when district courts must hold a hearing and
find facts.1353 “Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in
habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas ap-
plicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state
court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceed-
ing.” 1354 To “particularize” this general test, the Court went on to
hold that an evidentiary hearing must take place when (1) the mer-
its of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2)
the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the re-
cord as a whole; (3) the fact finding procedure employed was not
adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial
allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were
not adequately developed at the state hearing; or (6) for any rea-
son it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas
applicant a full and fair fact hearing.1355




its because she has failed properly or timely to present them, or when the petition
is a second or later petition raising either old or new, or mixed, claims. Of course,
as will be demonstrated infra, these cases have now been largely drained of their
force.
     1353 Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 310–12 (1963). If the district judge con-

cluded that the habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state
court resulting in reliable findings, the Court said, he may, and ordinarily should,
defer to the state factfinding. Id. at 318. Under the 1966 statutory revision, a ha-
beas court must generally presume correct a state court’s written findings of fact
from a hearing to which the petitioner was a party. A state finding cannot be set
aside merely on a preponderance of the evidence and the federal court granting the
writ must include in its opinion the reason it found the state findings not fairly
supported by the record or the existence of one or more listed factors justifying dis-
regard of the factfinding. Pub. L. 89–711, 80 Stat. 1105, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). See
Sumner v. Mata, 449 U.S. 539 (1981); Sumner v. Mata, 455 U.S. 591 (1982); Mar-
shall v. Lonberger, 459 U.S. 422 (1983); Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025 (1984); Parker
v. Dugger, 498 U.S. 308 (1991); Burden v. Zant, 498 U.S. 433 (1991). The presump-
tion of correctness does not apply to questions of law or to mixed questions of law
and fact. Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 110–16 (1985). However, in Wright v. West,
505 U.S. 277 (1992), the Justices argued inconclusively whether deferential review
of questions of law or especially of law and fact should be adopted.
     1354 Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312 (1963). The Court was unanimous on

the statement, but it divided 5 to 4 on application.
     1355 372 U.S. at 313–18. Congress in 1966 codified the factors in somewhat dif-

ferent form but essentially codified Townsend. Pub. L. 89–711, 80 Stat. 1105, 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254. The Court believes that Congress neither codified Townsend nor precluded
the Court from altering the Townsend standards. Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S.
1, 10, n.5 (1992). Compare id. at 20–21 (Justice O’Connor dissenting). Keeney for-
mally overruled part of Townsend. Id. at 5.
