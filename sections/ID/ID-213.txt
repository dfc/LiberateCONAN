to which nine classes of cases and controversies “shall extend.” 1182
While Justice Story deemed it imperative of Congress to create in-
ferior federal courts and, when they had been created, to vest them
with all the jurisdiction they were capable of receiving,1183 the First
Congress acted upon a wholly different theory. Inferior courts were
created, but jurisdiction generally over cases involving the Consti-
tution, laws, and treaties of the United States was not given them,
diversity jurisdiction was limited by a minimal jurisdictional amount
requirement and by a prohibition on creation of diversity through
assignments, equity jurisdiction was limited to those cases where a
“plain, adequate, and complete remedy” could not be had at law.1184
This care for detail in conferring jurisdiction upon the inferior fed-
eral courts bespoke a conviction by Members of Congress that it
was within their power to confer or to withhold jurisdiction at their
discretion. The cases have generally sustained this view.
     Thus, in Turner v. Bank of North America,1185 the issue was the
jurisdiction of the federal courts in a suit to recover on a promis-
sory note between two citizens of the same state but in which the
note had been assigned to a citizen of a second state so that suit
could be brought in federal court under its diversity jurisdiction, a
course of action prohibited by § 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.1186
Counsel for the bank argued that the grant of judicial power by
the Constitution was a direct grant of jurisdiction, provoking from
Chief Justice Ellsworth a considered doubt 1187 and from Justice Chase
a firm rejection. “The notion has frequently been entertained, that
the federal courts derive their judicial power immediately from the
constitution: but the political truth is, that the disposal of the judi-
cial power (except in a few specified instances) belongs to Con-
gress. If Congress has given the power to this Court, we possess it,
not otherwise: and if Congress has not given the power to us, or to
any other Court, it still remains at the legislative disposal. Be-
