two ways. It could be a common-law right, such that if the injury
were administered by a private party, one could sue on it; 486 or it
could be a right created by the Constitution or a statute.487 The
statutory right most relied on was the judicial review section of the
Administrative Procedure Act, which provided that “[a] person suf-
fering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected
or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant stat-
ute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 488 Early decisions under
this statute interpreted the language as adopting the “legal inter-
est” and “legal wrong” standard then prevailing as constitutional
requirements of standing, which generally had the effect of limit-
ing the type of injury cognizable in federal court to economic ones.489
    In 1970, however, the Court promulgated a two-pronged stand-
ing test: if the litigant (1) has suffered injury-in-fact and if he (2)
shows that the interest he seeks to protect is arguably within the
zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statutory guar-
antee in question, he has standing.490 Of even greater importance
was the expansion of the nature of the cognizable injury beyond

(Justice Frankfurter concurring). This was apparently the point of the definition of
“legal right” as “one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against
tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a privilege.” Tennessee

     487 Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 152 (1951)

(Justice Frankfurter concurring). The Court approached this concept in two interre-
lated ways. (1) It might be that a plaintiff had an interest that it was one of the
purposes of the statute in question to protect in some degree. Chicago Junction Case,
264 U.S. 258 (1924); Alexander Sprunt & Son v. United States, 281 U.S. 249 (1930);
Alton R.R. v. United States, 315 U.S. 15 (1942). Thus, in Hardin v. Kentucky Utili-
ties Co., 390 U.S. 1 (1968), a private utility was held to have standing to contest
allegedly illegal competition by TVA on the ground that the statute was meant to
give private utilities some protection from certain forms of TVA competition. (2) It
might be that a plaintiff was a “person aggrieved” within the terms of a judicial
review section of an administrative or regulatory statute. Injury to an economic in-
terest was sufficient to “aggrieve” a litigant. FCC v. Sanders Brothers Radio Sta-
tion, 309 U.S. 470 (1940); Associated Industries v. Ickes, 134 F.2d 694 (2d Cir. 1943),
cert. dismissed as moot, 320 U.S. 707 (1943).

     490 Ass’n of Data Processing Service Org. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970); Barlow

v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159 (1970). Justices Brennan and White argued that only injury-
in-fact should be requisite for standing. Id. at 167. In Clarke v. Securities Industry
Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388 (1987), the Court applied a liberalized zone-of-interest test. But
see Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 885–889 (1990); Air Courier
Conf. v. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517 (1991). In applying these stan-
dards, the Court, once it determined that the litigant’s interests were “arguably pro-
tected” by the statute in question, proceeded to the merits without thereafter paus-
ing to inquire whether in fact the interests asserted were among those protected.
