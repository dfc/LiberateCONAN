after the filing of the federal action but before any proceedings of
substance have taken place in federal court,536 and federal courts
were instructed not to issue declaratory judgments in the absence
of the factors permitting issuance of injunctions under the same cir-
cumstances. But in the absence of a pending state action or the sub-
sequent and timely filing of one, a request for a declaratory judg-
ment that a statute or ordinance is unconstitutional does not have
to meet the stricter requirements justifying the issuance of an in-
junction.537
    Ripeness.—Just as standing historically has concerned who may
bring an action in federal court, the ripeness doctrine concerns when
it may be brought. Formerly, it was a wholly constitutional prin-
ciple requiring a determination that the events bearing on the sub-
stantive issue have happened or are sufficiently certain to occur so
as to make adjudication necessary and so as to assure that the is-
sues are sufficiently defined to permit intelligent resolution. The fo-
cus was on the harm to the rights claimed rather than on the harm
to the plaintiff that gave him standing to bring the action,538 al-
though, to be sure, in most cases the harm is the same. But in lib-
eralizing the doctrine of ripeness in recent years the Court subdi-
vided it into constitutional and prudential parts 539 and conflated
standing and ripeness considerations.540
    The early cases generally required potential plaintiffs to expose
themselves to possibly irreparable injury in order to invoke federal
judicial review. Thus, in United Public Workers v. Mitchell,541 gov-
ernment employees alleged that they wished to engage in various
political activities and that they were deterred from their desires
by the Hatch Act prohibitions on political activities. As to all but
one plaintiff, who had himself actually engaged in forbidden activ-

    537 Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452 (1974). In cases covered by Steffel, the
federal court may issue preliminary or permanent injunctions to protect its judg-
ments, without satisfying the Younger tests. Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 930–
931 (1975); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 712 (1977).
    538 United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947); International Long-

shoremen’s Union v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222 (1954). For recent examples of lack of ripe-
ness, see Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726 (1998); Texas v. United
States, 523 U.S. 296 (1998).

tainty of injury a constitutional limitation, factual adequacy element a prudential
one).

ment satisfied by determination that Court would not be better prepared to render
a decision later than now). But compare Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312 (1991).
