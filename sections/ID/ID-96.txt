    Concepts of real interest and abstract questions appeared promi-
nently in United Public Workers v. Mitchell,501 an omnibus attack
on the constitutionality of the Hatch Act prohibitions on political
activities by governmental employees. With one exception, none of
the plaintiffs had violated the Act, though they stated they desired
to engage in forbidden political actions. The Court found no justi-
ciable controversy except in regard to the one, calling for “concrete
legal issues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions,” and see-
ing the suit as really an attack on the political expediency of the
Act.502
    Advisory Opinions.—In 1793, the Court unanimously refused
to grant the request of President Washington and Secretary of State
Jefferson to construe the treaties and laws of the United States per-
taining to questions of international law arising out of the wars of
the French Revolution.503 Noting the constitutional separation of pow-
ers and functions in his reply, Chief Justice Jay said: “These being
in certain respects checks upon each other, and our being Judges
of a Court in the last resort, are considerations which afford strong
arguments against the propriety of our extra-judicially deciding the
questions alluded to, especially as the power given by the Constitu-
tion to the President, of calling on the heads of departments for
opinions, seem to have been purposely as well as expressly united
to the Executive departments.” 504 Although the Court has gener-
ally adhered to its refusal, Justice Jackson was not quite correct
when he termed the policy a “firm and unvarying practice. . . .” 505
The Justices in response to a letter calling for suggestions on im-
provements in the operation of the courts drafted a letter suggest-
ing that circuit duty for the Justices was unconstitutional, but they
apparently never sent it; 506 Justice Johnson communicated to Presi-
dent Monroe, apparently with the knowledge and approval of the
other Justices, the views of the Justices on the constitutionality of
internal improvements legislation; 507 and Chief Justice Hughes in
a letter to Senator Wheeler on President Roosevelt’s Court Plan ques-

    501  330 U.S. 75 (1947).
    502  330 U.S. at 89–91. Justices Black and Douglas dissented, contending that
the controversy was justiciable. Justice Douglas could not agree that the plaintiffs
should have to violate the act and lose their jobs in order to test their rights. In
CSC v. National Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), the concerns ex-
pressed in Mitchell were largely ignored as the Court reached the merits in an an-
ticipatory attack on the Act. Compare Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968).
