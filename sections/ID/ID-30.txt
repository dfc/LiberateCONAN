it,149 and, second, an act of Congress must have conferred it.150 The
fact that federal courts are of limited jurisdiction means that liti-
gants in them must affirmatively establish that jurisdiction exists
and may not confer nonexistent jurisdiction by consent or con-
duct.151

Finality of Judgment as an Attribute of Judicial Power
    Since 1792, the federal courts have emphasized finality of judg-
ment as an essential attribute of judicial power. In that year, Con-
gress authorized Revolutionary War veterans to file pension claims
in circuit courts of the United States, directed the judges to certify
to the Secretary of War the degree of a claimant’s disability and
their opinion with regard to the proper percentage of monthly pay
to be awarded, but empowered the Secretary to withhold judicially
certified claimants from the pension list if he suspected “imposition
or mistake.” 152 The Justices then on circuit almost immediately for-
warded objections to the President, contending that the statute was
unconstitutional because the judicial power was constitutionally com-
mitted to the judicial department, the duties imposed by the act
were not judicial, and the subjection of a court’s opinions to revi-
sion or control by an officer of the executive or the legislature was
not authorized by the Constitution.153

the use of the word “all” in each of the federal question, admiralty, and public am-
bassador subclauses means that Congress must confer the entire judicial power to
cases involving those issues, whereas it has more discretion in the other six catego-
ries.
      149 Which was, of course, the point of Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137

(1803), once the power of the Court to hold legislation unconstitutional was estab-
lished.

U.S. (3 How.) 236 (1845); Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850); United States
v. Hudson & Goodwin, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 32, 33 (1812); Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260
U.S. 226 (1922). Some judges, however, have expressed the opinion that Congress’s
authority is limited by provisions of the Constitution such as the Due Process Clause,
so that a limitation on jurisdiction that denied a litigant access to any remedy might
be unconstitutional. Cf. Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 174 F.2d 961, 965–966 (D.C. Cir.
1949), rev’d on other grounds sub nom, Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950);
Battaglia v. General Motors Corp., 169 F.2d 254, 257 (2d Cir. 1948), cert. denied,
335 U.S. 887 (1948); Petersen v. Clark, 285 F. Supp. 700, 703 n.5 (N.D. Calif. 1968);
Murray v. Vaughn, 300 F. Supp. 688, 694–695 (D.R.I. 1969). The Supreme Court
has had no occasion to consider the question.
