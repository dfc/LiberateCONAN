complaining party would be subjected to the same action again, moot-
ness will not be found when the complained-of conduct ends.567 The
imposition of short sentences in criminal cases,568 the issuance of
injunctions to expire in a brief period,569 and the short-term fac-
tual context of certain events, such as elections 570 or pregnan-
cies,571 are all instances in which this exception is frequently in-
voked.
    An interesting and potentially significant liberalization of the
law of mootness, perhaps as part of a continuing circumstances ex-
ception, began in the 1970s in the context of class action litigation.
It was established that, when the controversy becomes moot as to
the plaintiff in a certified class action, it still remains alive for the
class he represents so long as an adversary relationship sufficient
to constitute a live controversy between the class members and the
other party exists.572 The Court was more closely divided in a 1980
case, United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, in which a denial
to certify a class was on appeal when the personal claim of the named
plaitiff became moot. The Court held that in the class action set-
ting there are two aspects of the Article III mootness question, the
existence of a live controversy and the existence of a “personal stake”
in the outcome for the named class representative.573 Finding a live
controversy remained for at least some class members, the Court
determined that the named plaintiff retained a distinct interest in
representing the class sufficient to satisfy the “imperatives of a dis-

Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 189–91 (2000),. The degree of expectation or likelihood
that the issue will recur has frequently divided the Court. Compare Murphy v. Hunt,
with Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976); compare Honig v. Doe,
484 U.S. 305, 318–23 (1988), with id. at 332 (Justice Scalia dissenting).

of these cases in United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 400 n.7
(1980). Mootness is not necessarily avoided in properly certified cases, but the stan-
dards of determination are unclear. See Kremens v. Bartley, 431 U.S. 119 (1977).
