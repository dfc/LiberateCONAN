than in majority opinions.748 Of lesser formal effect than outright
overruling but with roughly the same result is a Court practice of
“distinguishing” precedents, which often leads to an overturning of
the principle enunciated in a case while leaving the actual case more
or less alive.749
    Conclusion.—The common denominator of all these maxims of
prudence is the concept of judicial restraint. “We do not sit,” said
Justice Frankfurter, “like a kadi under a tree dispensing justice ac-
cording to considerations of individual expediency.” 750 “[A] jurist is
not to innovate at pleasure,” wrote Justice Cardozo. “He is not a
knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty
or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated prin-
ciples. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and un-
regulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by
tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subor-
dinated to the primordial necessity of order in the social life.” 751
All Justices will, of course, claim adherence to proper restraint,752
but in some cases at least, such as Justice Frankfurter’s dissent in
the Flag Salute Case,753 the practice can be readily observed. The
degree of restraint, however, the degree to which legislative enact-
ments should be subjected to judicial scrutiny, is a matter of uncer-
tain and shifting opinion




491 U.S. 164, 171–175 (1989), at least in part since Congress may much more eas-
ily revise those decisions, but compare id. at 175 n.1, with id. at 190–205 (Justice
Brennan concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). See also Flood
v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 (1972).
     748 E.g., United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 86 (1950) (Justice Frank-

furter dissenting); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 339–340 (1962) (Justice Harlan dis-
senting); Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 383 (1963) (Justice Harlan dissenting). But
see Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 195 (1958) (Justice Black dissenting). Com-
pare Justice Harlan’s views in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961) (dissenting), with
Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530 (1962) (opinion of the Court).
     749 Note that, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), while the

Court purported to uphold and retain the “central meaning” of Roe v. Wade, it over-
ruled several aspects of that case’s requirements. See also, e.g., the Court’s treat-
ment of Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621 (1904), in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330,
337, n.7 (1972). See also id. at 361 (Justice Blackmun concurring.)
     750 Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 11 (1949) (dissenting).

     752 Compare Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965) (Justice Doug-

las), with id. at 507 (Justice Black).

senting).
