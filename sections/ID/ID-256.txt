escalated by the stronger into capital charges of treason, as so of-
ten had happened in England.1413
    Thus, the Framers adopted two of the three formulations and
the phraseology of the English Statute of Treason enacted in 1350,1414
but they conspicuously omitted the phrase defining as treason the
“compass[ing] or imagin[ing] the death of our lord the King,” 1415
under which most of the English law of “constructive treason” had
been developed.1416 Beyond limiting the power of Congress to de-
fine treason,1417 the clause also prescribes limitations upon Con-
gress’s ability to make proof of the offense easy to establish 1418 and
its ability to define punishment.1419

Levying War
     Early judicial interpretation of the meaning of treason in terms
of levying war was conditioned by the partisan struggles of the early
nineteenth century, which involved the treason trials of Aaron Burr
and his associates. In Ex parte Bollman,1420 which involved two of
Burr’s confederates, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for himself and
three other Justices, confined the meaning of levying war to the
actual waging of war. “However flagitious may be the crime of con-

The most obviously restrictive feature of the constitutional definition is its omission
of any provision analogous to that branch of the Statute of Edward III which pun-
ished treason by compassing the death of the king. In a narrow sense, this provi-
sion perhaps had no proper analogue in a republic. However, to interpret the si-
lence of the Treason Clause in this way alone does justice neither to the technical
proficiency of the Philadelphia draftsmen nor to the practical statecraft and knowl-
edge of English political history among the Framers and proponents of the Constitu-
tion. The charge of compassing the king’s death had been the principal instrument
by which ‘treason’ had been used to suppress a wide range of political opposition,
from acts obviously dangerous to order and likely in fact to lead to the king’s death
to the mere speaking or writing of views restrictive of the royal authority.” Id. at
152–53.
     1417 The clause does not, however, prevent Congress from specifying other crimes

of a subversive nature and prescribing punishment, so long as Congress is not merely
attempting to evade the restrictions of the Treason Clause. E.g., Ex parte Bollman,
8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75, 126 (1807); Wimmer v. United States, 264 Fed. 11, 12–13 (6th Cir.
1920), cert. denied, 253 U.S. 494 (1920).
