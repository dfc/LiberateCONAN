tion of statutory construction were involved we should not be pre-
pared to abandon a doctrine so widely applied throughout nearly a
century. But the unconstitutionality of the course pursued has now
been made clear, and compels us to do so.” 1104 For a number of rea-
sons, it would not have been wise to have overruled Tyson on the
basis of arguable new discoveries.1105
    Second, the decision turned on the lack of power vested in Con-
gress to prescribe rules for federal courts in state cases. “There is
no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare
substantive rules of common law applicable in a State whether they
be local in their nature or ‘general,’ be they commercial law or a
part of the law of torts. No clause in the Constitution purports to
confer such a power upon the federal courts.” 1106 But having said
this, Justice Brandeis made it clear that the unconstitutional as-
sumption of power had been made not by Congress but by the Court
itself. “[W]e do not hold unconstitutional § 34 of the Federal Judi-
ciary Act of 1789 or any other Act of Congress. We merely declare

    1104  304 U.S. at 77–78 (footnote citations omitted).
    1105  Congress had re-enacted § 34 as § 721 of the Revised Statutes, citing Swift
v. Tyson in its annotation, thus presumably accepting the gloss placed on the words
by that ruling. But note that Justice Brandeis did not think even the re-enacted
statute was unconstitutional. 304 U.S. at 79–80. See H. FRIENDLY, BENCHMARKS 161–
163 (1967). Perhaps a more compelling reason of policy was that stated by Justice
Frankfurter rejecting for the Court a claim that the general grant of federal ques-
tion jurisdiction to the federal courts in 1875 made maritime suits cognizable on the
law side of the federal courts. “Petitioner now asks us to hold that no student of the
jurisdiction of the federal courts or of admiralty, no judge, and none of the learned
and alert members of the admiralty bar were able, for seventy-five years, to discern
the drastic change now asserted to have been contrived in admiralty jurisdiction by
the Act of 1875. In light of such impressive testimony from the past the claim of a
sudden discovery of a hidden latent meaning in an old technical phrase is surely
suspect.”
     “The history of archeology is replete with the unearthing of riches buried for
centuries. Our legal history does not, however, offer a single archeological discovery
of new, revolutionary meaning in reading an old judiciary enactment. [Here, the Jus-
tice footnotes: ‘For reasons that would take us too far afield to discuss, Erie Rail-
road Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, is no exception.’] The presumption is powerful
that such a far-reaching, dislocating construction as petitioner would now have us
find in the Act of 1875 was not uncovered by judges, lawyers or scholars for seventy-
five years because it is not there.” Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co.,
358 U.S. 354, 370–371 (1959).
     1106 304 U.S. at 78. Justice Brandeis does not argue the constitutional issue and

does not cite either provisions of the Constitution or precedent beyond the views of
Justices Holmes and Field. Id. at 78–79. Justice Reed thought that Article III and
the Necessary and Proper Clause might contain authority. Id. at 91–92 (Justice Reed
concurring in the result). For a formulation of the constitutional argument in favor
of the Brandeis position, see H. FRIENDLY, BENCHMARKS 167–171 (1967). See also Bernhardt
v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.S. 198, 202, 208 (1956); Hanna v. Plumer, 380
U.S. 460, 471–472 (1965).
