ferral of ever-increasing grants of jurisdiction to enforce the guar-
antees recognized and enacted by Congress.761
    When a Case Arises Under.—The 1875 statute and its pres-
ent form both speak of civil suits “arising under the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States,” 762 the language of the Con-
stitution. Thus, many of the early cases relied heavily upon Chief
Justice Marshall’s construction of the constitutional language to in-
terpret the statutory language.763 The result was probably to ac-
cept more jurisdiction than Congress had intended to convey.764 Later
cases take a somewhat more restrictive course.
    Determination whether there is federal question jurisdiction is
made on the basis of the plaintiff ’s pleadings and not upon the re-
sponse or the facts as they may develop.765 Plaintiffs seeking ac-
cess to federal courts on this ground must set out a federal claim
which is “well-pleaded” and the claim must be real and substantial
and may not be without color of merit.766 Plaintiffs may not antici-
pate that defendants will raise a federal question in answer to the
action.767 But what exactly must be pleaded to establish a federal
question is a matter of considerable uncertainty in many cases. It
is no longer the rule that, when federal law is an ingredient of the
claim, there is a federal question.768

Exchange, 263 U.S. 291, 305–308 (1923). If the complaint states a case arising un-
der the Constitution or federal law, then federal jurisdiction exists even though on
the merits the party may have no federal right. In such a case, the proper course
for the court is to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted
rather than for want of jurisdiction. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946). Of course,
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is proper if the federal claim is frivolous or obvi-
ously insubstantial. Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105 (1933).
