suit.” 552 Because, with the advent of declaratory judgments, it is
open to the federal courts to “declare the rights and other legal re-
lations” of the parties with res judicata effect,553 the question in
cases alleged to be moot now seems largely if not exclusively to be
decided in terms of whether an actual controversy continues to ex-
ist between the parties rather than in terms of any additional older
concepts.554 So long as concrete, adverse legal interests between the
parties continue, a case is not made moot by intervening actions
that cast doubt on the practical enforceability of a final judicial or-
der.555




     552 Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477–78 (1990) (internal cita-

tions omitted). The Court’s emphasis upon mootness as a constitutional limitation
mandated by Article III is long stated in the cases. E.g., Liner v. Jafco, 375 U.S.
301, 306 n.3 (1964); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 316 (1974); Sibron v. New
York, 392 U.S. 40, 57 (1968). See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317 (1988), and id. at
332 (Justice Scalia dissenting). But compare Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424
U.S. 747, 756 n.8 (1976) (referring to mootness as presenting policy rather than con-
stitutional considerations). If this foundation exists, it is hard to explain the excep-
tions, which partake of practical reasoning. In any event, Chief Justice Rehnquist
has argued that the mootness doctrine is not constitutionally based, or not suffi-
ciently based only on Article III, so that the Court should not dismiss cases that
have become moot after the Court has taken them for review. Id. at 329 (concur-
ring). Consider the impact of Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U.S.
83 (1993).
     553 But see Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 470–72 (1974); id. at 477 (Justice

White concurring), 482 n.3 (Justice Rehnquist concurring) (on res judicata effect in
state court in subsequent prosecution). In any event, the statute authorizes the fed-
eral court to grant “[f]urther necessary or proper relief,” which could include enjoin-
ing state prosecutions.
     554 Award of process and execution are no longer essential to the concept of ju-

dicial power. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227 (1937).
     555 Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–1347, slip op. (2013) (appeal of dis-

trict court order returning custody of a child to her mother in Scotland not made
moot by physical return of child to Scotland and subsequent ruling of Scottish court
in favor of the mother continuing to have custody).
