be maintained where there was a full and adequate remedy at law.
Although this provision did no more than declare a pre-existing rule
long applied in chancery courts,301 it did assert the power of Con-
gress to regulate the equity powers of the federal courts. The Act of
March 2, 1793,302 prohibited the issuance of any injunction by any
court of the United States to stay proceedings in state courts ex-
cept where such injunctions may be authorized by any law relating
to bankruptcy proceedings. In subsequent statutes, Congress pro-
hibited the issuance of injunctions in the federal courts to restrain
the collection of taxes,303 provided for a three-judge court as a pre-
requisite to the issuance of injunctions to restrain the enforcement
of state statutes for unconstitutionality,304 for enjoining federal stat-
utes for unconstitutionality,305 and for enjoining orders of the Inter-
state Commerce Commission,306 limited the power to issue injunc-
tions restraining rate orders of state public utility commissions,307
and the use of injunctions in labor disputes,308 and placed a very
rigid restriction on the power to enjoin orders of the Administrator
under the Emergency Price Control Act.309
    Perhaps pressing its powers further than prior legislation, Con-
gress has enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996.310 Es-
sentially, the law imposes a series of restrictions on judicial rem-
edies in prison-conditions cases. Thus, courts may not issue prospective
relief that extends beyond that necessary to correct the violation of
a federal right that they have found, that is narrowly drawn, is the
least intrusive, and that does not give attention to the adverse im-
pact on public safety. Preliminary injunctive relief is limited by the
same standards. Consent decrees may not be approved unless they
are subject to the same conditions, meaning that the court must
conduct a trial and find violations, thus cutting off consent decrees.

     304 This provision was repealed in 1976, save for apportionment and districting

suits and when otherwise required by an Act of Congress. Pub. L. 94–381, § 1, 90
Stat. 1119, and § 3, 28 U.S.C. § 2284. Congress occasionally provides for such courts,
as in the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1973c.
     305 Repealed by Pub. L. 94–381, § 2, 90 Stat. 1119 (1976). Congress occasionally

provides for such courts now, in order to expedite Supreme Court consideration of
constitutional challenges to critical federal laws. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714,
719–721 (1986) (3-judge court and direct appeal to Supreme Court in the Balanced
