tempt, however, such bodies must be acting within the authority
that has been lawfully delegated to them.242

Sanctions Other Than Contempt
     Long recognized by the courts as inherent powers are those au-
thorities that are necessary to the administration of the judicial sys-
tem itself, of which the contempt power just discussed is only the
most controversial.243 Courts, as elements of an independent and
coequal branch of government, once they are created and their ju-
risdiction established, have the authority to do what courts have
traditionally done in order to accomplish their assigned tasks.244 Of
course, these inherent powers may be limited by statutes and by
rules,245 but, just as noted above in the discussion of the same is-
sue with respect to contempt, the Court asserts both the power to
act in areas not covered by statutes and rules and the power to act
unless Congress has not only provided regulation of the exercise of
the power, but also has unmistakably enunciated its intention to
limit the courts’ inherent powers.246
     Thus, in Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., the Court upheld the impo-
sition of monetary sanctions against a litigant and his attorney for
bad-faith litigation conduct in a diversity case. Some of the conduct
was covered by a federal statute and several sanction provisions of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but some was not, and the
Court held that, absent a showing that Congress had intended to
limit the courts, they could use their inherent powers to impose sanc-
tions for the entire course of conduct, including shifting attorneys’
fees, which is ordinarily against the common-law American rule.247
In another case, a party failed to comply with discovery orders and
a court order concerning a schedule for filing briefs. The Supreme
Court held that the attorneys’ fees statute did not allow assess-
     242 Gojack v. United States, 384 U.S. 702 (1966). See also Sanctions of the Inves-

tigatory Power: Contempt, supra, for a discussion of Congress’s power to cite an in-
dividual for contempt by virtue of its investigatory duties, which is applicable, at
least by analogy, to administrative agencies.
     243 “Certain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice, from

the nature of their institution. . . . To fine for contempt, imprison for contumacy,
enforce the observance of order, &c., are powers which cannot be dispensed with in
a court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others: and so far our courts,
no doubt, possess powers not immediately derived from statute . . . .” United States
