they both apply.” 698 To declare otherwise, Chief Justice Marshall
said, would be to permit the legislature to “pass[ ] at pleasure” the
limits imposed on its powers by the Constitution.699
     The Chief Justice then turned from the philosophical justifica-
tion for judicial review as arising from the very concept of a writ-
ten constitution, to specific clauses of the Constitution. The judicial
power, he observed, was extended to “all cases arising under the
constitution.” 700 It was “too extravagant to be maintained that the
Framers had intended that a case arising under the constitution
should be decided without examining the instrument under which
it arises.” 701 Suppose, he said, that Congress laid a duty on an ar-
ticle exported from a state or passed a bill of attainder or an ex
post facto law or provided that treason should be proved by the tes-
timony of one witness. Would the courts enforce such a law in the
face of an express constitutional provision? They would not, he con-
tinued, because their oath required by the Constitution obligated
them to support the Constitution and to enforce such laws would
violate the oath.702 Finally, the Chief Justice noted that the Su-
premacy Clause (Art. VI, cl. 2) gave the Constitution precedence
over laws and treaties, providing that only laws “which shall be made
in pursuance of the constitution” shall be the supreme law of the
land.703
     The decision in Marbury v. Madison has never been disturbed,
although it has been criticized and has had opponents throughout
our history. It not only carried the day in the federal courts, but
from its announcement judicial review by state courts of local legis-
lation under local constitutions made rapid progress and was se-
curely established in all states by 1850.704
