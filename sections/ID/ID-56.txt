conclusive in habeas on all issues of fact or law actually adjudi-
cated.294 A federal prisoner in a § 2255 proceeding will file his mo-
tion in the court that sentenced him; 295 a state prisoner in a fed-
eral habeas action may file either in the district of the court in which
he was sentenced or in the district in which he is in custody.296
     Habeas corpus is not a substitute for an appeal.297 It is not a
method to test ordinary procedural errors at trial or violations of
state law but only to challenge alleged errors which if established
would go to make the entire detention unlawful under federal law.298
If, after appropriate proceedings, the habeas court finds that on the
facts discovered and the law applied the prisoner is entitled to re-
lief, it must grant it, ordinarily ordering the government to release
the prisoner unless he is retried within a certain period.299

Congressional Limitation of the Injunctive Power
    Although some judicial dicta 300 support the idea of an inherent
power of the federal courts sitting in equity to issue injunctions in-
dependently of statutory limitations, neither the course taken by
Congress nor the specific rulings of the Supreme Court support any
such principle. Congress has repeatedly exercised its power to limit
the use of the injunction in federal courts. The first limitation on
the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts is to be found in § 16 of
the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided that no equity suit should
     294 28 U.S.C. § 2244(c). But an affirmance of a conviction by an equally divided

Court is not an adjudication on the merits. Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).
     295 28 U.S.C. § 2255.
     296 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d). Cf. Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, 410 U.S. 484

(1973), overruling Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188 (1948), and holding that a peti-
tioner may file in the district in which his custodian is located even though the pris-
oner may be located elsewhere.
     297 Glasgow v. Moyer, 225 U.S. 420, 428 (1912); Riddle v. Dyche, 262 U.S. 333,

335 (1923); Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.S. 304, 311 (1946). But
compare Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 558–560 (1953) (Justice Frankfurter dissent-
ing in part).
     298 Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62 (1991); Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780

(1990); Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 41–42 (1984).
     299 8 U.S.C. § 2244(b). See Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 569 (1971); Irvin

v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 729 (1961).
     300 In United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 339 (1906),

Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court, approached a theory of inherent equity ju-
risdiction when he declared: “The principles of equity exist independently of and an-
terior to all Congressional legislation, and the statutes are either enunciations of
those principles or limitations upon their application in particular cases.” It should
be emphasized, however, that the Court made no suggestion that it could apply pre-
existing principles of equity without jurisdiction over the subject matter. Indeed, the
inference is to the contrary. In a dissenting opinion in which Justices McKenna and
Van Devanter joined, in Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, 244 U.S. 459, 475 (1917), Justice
Pitney contended that Article III, § 2, “had the effect of adopting equitable remedies
in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States where such
remedies are appropriate.”
