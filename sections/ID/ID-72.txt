    The standing rules apply to actions brought in federal courts,
and they have no direct application to actions brought in state
courts.381
     Generalized or Widespread Injuries.—Persons do not have
standing to sue in federal court when all they can claim is that
they have an interest or have suffered an injury that is shared by
all members of the public. Thus, a group of persons suing as citi-
zens to litigate a contention that membership of Members of Con-
gress in the military reserves constituted a violation of Article I,
§ 6, cl. 2, was denied standing.382 “The only interest all citizens share
in the claim advanced by respondents is one which presents injury
in the abstract. . . . [The] claimed nonobservance [of the clause],
standing alone, would adversely affect only the generalized interest
of all citizens in constitutional governance.” 383
    It is unclear, however, whether this rule against airing “gener-
alized grievances” through the courts has a constitutional or a pru-
dential basis 384 and thus can be modified by statute. And, despite
the general rule that injury’s shared by all citizens share is insuffi-
cient to confer standing, where a plaintiff alleges that the defen-
dant’s action injures him in “a concrete and personal way,” “it does
not matter how many [other] persons have [also] been injured. . . .
[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has
found injury in fact.” 385

     381 Thus, state courts could adjudicate a case brought by a person who had no

standing in the federal sense. If the plaintiff lost, he would have no recourse in the
U.S. Supreme Court, because of his lack of standing, Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S.
44 (1943); Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429 (1952), but if plaintiff pre-
vailed, the losing defendant might be able to appeal, because he might be able to
assert sufficient injury to his federal interests. ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S.

Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United, 454 U.S. 464, 485, 490 (1982)
(apparently constitutional). In Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984), it is again
prudential.
