ernment.” 156 More recently, the Court avoided a similar situation
by a close construction of a statute.157
     Award of Execution.—The adherence of the Court to this propo-
sition, however, has not extended to a rigid rule formulated by Chief
Justice Taney, given its fullest expression in a posthumously pub-
lished opinion.158 In Gordon v. United States,159 the Court refused
to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Claims; the act
establishing the Court of Claims provided for appeals to the Su-
preme Court, after which judgments in favor of claimants were to
be referred to the Secretary of the Treasury for payments out of
the general appropriation for payment of private claims. But the
act also provided that no funds should be paid out of the Treasury
for any claims “till after an appropriation therefor shall be esti-
mated for by the Secretary of the Treasury.” 160 The opinion of the
Court merely stated that the implication of power in the executive
officer and in Congress to revise all decisions of the Court of Claims
requiring payment of money denied that court the judicial power
from the exercise of which “alone” appeals could be taken to the
Supreme Court.161
     In his posthumously published opinion, Chief Justice Taney, be-
cause the judgment of the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court
depended for execution upon future action of the Secretary and of
Congress, regarded any such judgment as nothing more than a cer-

    157   Connor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690 (1971). Under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, 42 U.S.C. § 1973e, no state may “enact or seek to administer”
any change in election law or practice different from that in effect on a particular
date without obtaining the approval of the Attorney General or the district court in
the District of Columbia, a requirement interpreted to reach reapportionment and
redistricting. Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544 (1969); Perkins v. Mat-
thews, 400 U.S. 379 (1971). The issue in Connor was whether a districting plan drawn
up and ordered into effect by a federal district court, after it had rejected a legisla-
tively drawn plan, must be submitted for approval. Unanimously, on the papers with-
out oral argument, the Court ruled that, despite the statute’s inclusive language, it
did not apply to court-drawn plans.
      158 Gordon v. United States, 117 U.S. 697 (1865) (published 1885). See United

States v. Jones, 119 U.S. 477 (1886). The Chief Justice’s initial effort was in United
States v. Ferreira, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 40 (1852).

      160 Act of February 24, 1855, 10 Stat. 612, as amended, Act of March 3, 1963,

12 Stat. 737, as paraphrased in Gordon v. United States, 117 U.S. at 698.
      161 Gordon v. United States, 69 U.S. (2 Wall.) 561 (1865). Following repeal of

the objectionable section, Act of March 17, 1866, 14 Stat. 9, the Court accepted ap-
pellate jurisdiction. United States v. Jones, 119 U.S. 477 (1886); De Groot v. United
States, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 419 (1867). But note that execution of the judgments was
still dependent upon congressional appropriations. On the effect of the requirement
for appropriations at a time when appropriations had to be made for judgments over
$100,000, see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 568–571 (1962). Cf. Regional Rail
Reorganization Act Cases (Blanchette v. Connecticut General Ins. Corp.), 419 U.S.
102, 148–149 & n.35 (1974).
