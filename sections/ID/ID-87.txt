rather than as applied, and a defendant to whom the statute con-
stitutionally applies may thereby be enabled to assert its unconsti-
tutionality.454
    Legal challenges based upon the allocation of governmental au-
thority under the Constitution, e.g., separation of powers and feder-
alism, are generally based on a showing of injury to the disadvan-
taged governmental institution. The prohibition on litigating the
injuries of others, however, does not appear to bar individuals from
bringing these suits. For instance, injured private parties routinely
bring separation-of-powers challenges,455 even though one could ar-
gue that the injury in question is actually upon the authority of
the affected branch of government. Then, in Bond v. United States,456
the Court considered whether a criminal defendant could raise fed-
eralism arguments based on state prerogatives under the Tenth
Amendment.457 There, the Court held that individuals could raise
Tenth Amendment challenges, because states are not the “sole in-
tended beneficiaries of federalism,” and an individual has a “direct
interest in objecting to laws that upset the constitutional balance
between the National Government and the States . . . .” 458

     454 Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 (1939); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S.

88 (1940); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948); Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380
U.S. 479, 486–487 (1965); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972); Lewis v. City of
New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974). The Court has narrowed its overbreadth doc-
trine, though not consistently, in recent years. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601
(1973); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50, 59–60 (1976), and id. at 73
(Justice Powell concurring); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 771–773 (1982). But
the exception as stated in the text remains strong. E.g., Secretary of State v. Joseph
H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947 (1984); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass’n, 484
U.S. 383 (1988).

     457 The defendant, in an attempt to harass a woman who had become impreg-

nated by the defendant’s husband, had placed caustic substances on objects the woman
was likely to touch. The defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 229, a broad
prohibition against the use of harmful chemicals, enacted as part of the implemen-
tation of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. The specifics of
the defendant’s Tenth Amendment argument was not before the Court.

sue to redress injuries to itself. See Havens Realty Co. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363,
378–379 (1982).
