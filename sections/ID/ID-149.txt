tional amount provision 798 (while the general federal question statute
at one time did) 799 and because the Court has held inapplicable the
judicially created requirement that a litigant exhaust his state rem-
edies before bringing federal action,800 the statute has been heavily
used, resulting in a formidable caseload, by plaintiffs attacking ra-
cial discrimination, malapportionment and suffrage restrictions, il-
legal and unconstitutional police practices, state restrictions on ac-
cess to welfare and other public assistance, and a variety of other
state and local governmental practices.801 Congress has encour-
aged use of the two statutes by providing for attorneys’ fees under
§ 1983,802 and by enacting related and specialized complementary
statutes.803 The Court in recent years has generally interpreted § 1983
and its jurisdictional statute broadly, but it has also sought to re-
strict the kinds of claims that may be brought in federal courts.804
Note that § 1983 and § 1343(3) need not always go together, as § 1983
actions may be brought in state courts.805
    Pendent Jurisdiction.—Once jurisdiction has been acquired
through allegation of a federal question not plainly wanting in sub-
stance,806 a federal court may decide any issue necessary to the dis-

not spring from an act providing for equal rights may not be brought under § 1343(3).
Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., supra. This was important when there
was a jurisdictional amount provision in the federal question statute but is of little
significance today.
     798 See Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939). Following Hague, it was argued that

only cases involving personal rights, that could not be valued in dollars, could be
brought under § 1343(3), and that cases involving property rights, which could be so
valued, had to be brought under the federal question statute. This attempted distinc-
tion was rejected in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 546–48 (1972).
On the valuation of constitutional rights, see Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978).
See also Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299 (1986) (compen-
satory damages must be based on injury to the plaintiff, not on some abstract valu-
ation of constitutional rights).

tional amount requirement. Pub. L. 94–574, 90 Stat. 2721; Pub. L. 96–486, 94 Stat.

     800 Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496 (1982). This had been the

rule since at least McNeese v. Cahokia Bd. of Educ., 373 U.S. 668 (1963). See also
Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131 (1988) (state notice of claim statute, requiring notice
and waiting period before bringing suit in state court under § 1983, is preempted).
     801 Thus, such notable cases as Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),

and Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), arose under the statutes.
