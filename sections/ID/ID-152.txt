preme Court. In Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,821 the
Court reviewed a congressional grant of jurisdiction to federal courts
to hear suits by an alien against a foreign state, jurisdiction not
within the “arising under” provision of article III. Federal substan-
tive law was not applicable, that resting either on state or interna-
tional law. Refusing to consider protective jurisdiction, the Court
found that the statute regulated foreign commerce by promulgat-
ing rules governing sovereign immunity from suit and was a law
requiring interpretation as a federal-question matter. That the doc-
trine does raise constitutional doubts is perhaps grounds enough to
avoid reaching it.822
     Supreme Court Review of State Court Decisions.—In addi-
tion to the constitutional issues presented by § 25 of the Judiciary
Act of 1789 and subsequent enactments,823 questions have contin-
ued to arise concerning review of state court judgments which go
directly to the nature and extent of the Supreme Court’s appellate
jurisdiction. Because of the sensitivity of federal-state relations and
the delicate nature of the matters presented in litigation touching
upon them, jurisdiction to review decisions of a state court is depen-
dent in its exercise not only upon ascertainment of the existence of
a federal question but upon a showing of exhaustion of state rem-
edies and of the finality of the state judgment. Because the applica-
tion of these standards to concrete facts is neither mechanical nor
nondiscretionary, the Justices have often been divided over whether
these requisites to the exercise of jurisdiction have been met in spe-
cific cases submitted for review by the Court.
    The Court is empowered to review the judgments of “the high-
est court of a State in which a decision could be had.” 824 This will
ordinarily be the state’s court of last resort, but it could well be an

    822  E.g., Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 136–37 (1989) (would present grave
constitutional problems).
     823 On § 25, see “Judicial Review and National Supremacy,” supra. The present

statute is 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a), which provides that review by writ of certiorari is
available where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in
question or where the validity of a statute of any state is drawn in question on the
ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United
States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed
under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or au-
thority exercised under, the United States. Prior to 1988, there was a right to man-
datory appeal in cases in which a state court had found invalid a federal statute or
treaty or in which a state court had upheld a state statute contested under the Con-
stitution, a treaty, or a statute of the United States. See the Act of June 25, 1948,
62 Stat. 929. The distinction between certiorari and appeal was abolished by the
Act of June 27, 1988, Pub. L. 100–352, § 3, 102 Stat. 662.
