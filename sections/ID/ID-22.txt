    Bankruptcy Courts.—After extended and lengthy debate, Con-
gress in 1978 revised the bankruptcy act and created a bankruptcy
court as an “adjunct” of the district courts. The court was com-
posed of judges vested with practically all the judicial power of the
United States, serving for 14-year terms, subject to removal for cause
by the judicial councils of the circuits, and with salaries subject to
statutory change.105 The bankruptcy courts were given jurisdiction
over not only civil proceedings arising under the bankruptcy code,
but all other proceedings arising in or related to bankruptcy cases,
with review in Article III courts under a clearly erroneous stan-
dard.
    This broad grant of jurisdiction, however, brought into question
what kinds of cases could be heard by an Article I court. In North-
ern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., a case in which
a company petitioning for reorganization made a claim against an-
other company for breaches of contract and warranty—purely state
law claims—the Court held that the conferral of jurisdiction upon
Article I judges to hear state claims regarding traditional common
law actions such as existed at the time of the drafting of the Con-
stitution was unconstitutional.106 Although the holding was ex-
tremely narrow, a plurality of the Court sought to rationalize and
limit the Court’s jurisprudence of Article I courts.
     According to the plurality, a fundamental principle of separa-
tion of powers requires the judicial power of the United States to
be exercised by courts having the attributes prescribed in Article
III. Congress may not evade the constitutional order by allocating
this judicial power to courts whose judges lack security of tenure
and compensation. Only in three narrowly circumscribed instances
may judicial power be distributed outside the Article III frame-
     104 411 U.S. at 407–08. See also Pernell v. Southall Realty Co., 416 U.S. 363,

365–365 (1974); Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372 (1977); Key v. Doyle, 434 U.S. 59
(1978). Under Swain, provision for hearing of motions for post-judgement relief by
convicted persons in the District, the present equivalent of habeas for federal con-
victs, is placed in Article I courts. That there are limits to Congress’s discretion is
asserted in dictum in Territory of Guam v. Olsen, 431 U.S. 195, 201–202, 204 (1977).
     105 Bankruptcy Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95–598, 92 Stat. 2549, codified in titles 11,

28. The bankruptcy courts were made “adjuncts” of the district courts by § 201(a),
28 U.S.C. § 151(a). For citation to the debate with respect to Article III versus Ar-
ticle I status for these courts, see Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe
Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 61 n.12 (1982) (plurality opinion).
     106 The statement of the holding is that of the two concurring Justices, 458 U.S.

at 89 (Justices Rehnquist and O’Connor), with which the plurality agreed “at the
least,” while desiring to go further. Id. at 87 n.40.
