     But, in two later cases, the Court contracted the application of
Erie in matters governed by the Federal Rules. Thus, in the earlier
case, the Court said that “outcome” was no longer the sole determi-
nant and countervailing considerations expressed in federal policy
on the conduct of federal trials should be considered; a state rule
making it a question for the judge rather than a jury of a particu-
lar defense in a tort action had to yield to a federal policy enunci-
ated through the Seventh Amendment of favoring juries.1119 Some
confusion has been injected into consideration of which law to apply—
state or federal—in the absence of a federal statute or a Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure.1120 In an action for damages, the federal
courts were faced with the issue of the application either of a state
statute, which gave the appellate division of the state courts the
authority to determine if an award is excessive or inadequate if it
deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation,
or of a federal judicially created practice of review of awards as so
exorbitant that it shocked the conscience of the court. The Court
determined that the state statute was both substantive and proce-
dural, which would result in substantial variations between state
and federal damage awards depending whether the state or the fed-
eral approach was applied; it then followed the mode of analysis
exemplified by those cases emphasizing the importance of federal
courts reaching the same outcome as would the state courts,1121 rather
than what had been the prevailing standard, in which the Court
balanced state and federal interests to determine which law to ap-
ply.1122 Emphasis upon either approach to considerations of apply-
ing state or federal law reflects a continuing difficulty of accommo-
dating “the constitutional power of the states to regulate the relations
among their citizens . . . [and] the constitutional power of the Fed-
eral Government to determine how its courts are to be oper-
ated.” 1123 Additional decisions will be required to determine which
approach, if either, prevails. The latter ruling simplified the matter
greatly. Erie is not to be the proper test when the question is the
application of one of the Rules of Civil Procedure; if the rule is valid
when measured against the Enabling Act and the Constitution, it
is to be applied regardless of state law to the contrary.1124

tion.
