country, and the power to make such amendments is coextensive
with that law. It is not confined to the boundaries or class of sub-
jects which limit and characterize the power to regulate commerce;
but, in maritime matters, it extends to all matters and places to
which the maritime law extends.” 865
    The law administered by federal courts in admiralty is there-
fore an amalgam of the general maritime law insofar as it is accept-
able to the courts, modifications of that law by congressional amend-
ment, the common law of torts and contracts as modified to the extent
constitutionally possible by state legislation, and international prize
law. This body of law is at all times subject to modification by the
paramount authority of Congress acting in pursuance of its powers
under the Admiralty and Maritime Clause and the Necessary and
Proper Clause and, no doubt, the Commerce Clause, now that the
Court’s interpretation of that clause has become so expansive. Of
this power there has been uniform agreement among the Justices
of the Court.866
    Admiralty and Maritime Cases.—Admiralty and maritime ju-
risdiction comprises two types of cases: (1) those involving acts com-
     865 In re Garnett, 141 U.S. 1, 12 (1891). See also Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,

244 U.S. 205, 215 (1917); Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U.S. 149, 160 (1920);
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 55 (1932). The Jones Act, under which injured sea-
men may maintain an action at law for damages, has been reviewed as an exercise
of legislative power deducible from the Admiralty Clause. Panama R.R. v. Johnson,
264 U.S. 375, 386, 388, 391 (1924); Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co.,
358 U.S. 354, 360–361 (1959). On the limits to the congressional power, see Panama
R.R. v. Johnson, 264 U.S. at 386–87; Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum, 293
U.S. 21, 43–44 (1934).
     866 Thus, Justice McReynolds’ assertion of the paramountcy of congressional power

in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 215 (1917), was not disputed by the
four dissenters in that case and is confirmed in subsequent cases critical of Jensen
which in effect invite congressional modification of maritime law. E.g., Davis v. De-
partment of Labor and Industries, 317 U.S. 249 (1942). The nature of maritime law
has excited some relevant controversy. In American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 26 U.S. (1
Pet.) 516, 545 (1828), Chief Justice Marshall declared that admiralty cases do not
“arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States” but “are as old as navi-
gation itself; and the law, admiralty and maritime as it has existed for ages, is ap-
plied by our Courts to the cases as they arise.” In Romero v. International Terminal
Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354 (1959), the plaintiff sought a jury trial in federal court
on a seaman’s suit for personal injury on an admiralty claim, contending that cases
arising under the general maritime law are “civil actions” that arise “under the Con-
stitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Five Justices in
an opinion by Justice Frankfurter disagreed. Maritime cases do not arise under the
Constitution or laws of the United States for federal question purposes and must,
absent diversity, be instituted in admiralty where there is no jury trial. The dissent-
ing four, Justice Brennan for himself and Chief Justice Warren and Justices Black
and Douglas, contended that maritime law, although originally derived from interna-
tional sources, is operative within the United States only by virtue of having been
accepted and adopted pursuant to Article III, and accordingly judicially originated
rules formulated under authority derived from that Article are “laws” of the United
States to the same extent as those enacted by Congress.
