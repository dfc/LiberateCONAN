before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdic-
tion which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one
or the other would be treason to the constitution.” As the comment
recognizes, because judicial review grows out of the fiction that courts
only declare what the law is in specific cases 719 and are without
will or discretion,720 its exercise is surrounded by the inherent limi-
tations of the judicial process, most basically, of course, by the ne-
cessity of a case or controversy and the strands of the doctrine com-
prising the concept of justiciability.721 But, although there are hints
of Chief Justice Marshall’s activism in some modern cases,722 the
Court has always adhered, at times more strictly than at other times,
to several discretionary rules or concepts of restraint in the exer-
cise of judicial review, the practice of which is very much contrary
to the quoted dicta from Cohens. These rules, it should be noted,
are in addition to the vast discretionary power which the Supreme
Court has to grant or deny review of judgements in lower courts, a
discretion fully authorized with certiorari jurisdiction but in effect
in practice as well with regard to what remains of appeals.723




     719 See, e.g., Justice Sutherland in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U.S. 525,

544 (1923), and Justice Roberts in United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 62 (1936).
     720 “Judicial power, as contradistinguished from the powers of the law, has no

existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing.” Osborn
v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 866 (1824) (Chief Justice Mar-
shall). See also Justice Roberts in United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 62–63 (1936).
     721 The political question doctrine is another limitation arising in part out of

inherent restrictions and in part from prudential considerations. For a discussion of
limitations utilizing both stands, see Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 346–56 (1936)
(Justice Brandeis concurring).
     722 Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 548–49 (1969); Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S.

186, 211 (1962); Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248 (1967).
     723 28 U.S.C. §§ 1254–1257. See F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, supra at ch. 7. “The

Supreme Court is not, and never has been, primarily concerned with the correction
of errors in lower court decisions. In almost all cases within the Court’s appellate
jurisdiction, the petitioner has already received one appellate review of his case . . . .
If we took every case in which an interesting legal question is raised, or our prima
facie impression is that the decision below is erroneous, we could not fulfill the Con-
stitutional and statutory responsibilities placed upon the Court. To remain effective,
the Supreme Court must continue to decide only those cases which present ques-
tions whose resolution will have immediate importance far beyond the particular
facts and parties involved.” Chief Justice Vinson, Address on the Work of the Fed-
eral Court, in 69 Sup. Ct. v, vi. It “is only accurate to a degree to say that our juris-
diction in cases on appeal is obligatory as distinguished from discretionary on certio-
rari.” Chief Justice Warren, quoted in Wiener, The Supreme Court’s New Rules, 68
HARV. L. REV. 20, 51 (1954).
