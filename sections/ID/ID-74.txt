ing power, but Frothingham did not, having alleged only that the
Tenth Amendment had been exceeded. The Court reserved the ques-
tion whether other specific limitations constrain the Taxing and Spend-
ing Clause in the same manner as the Establishment Clause.389
     Since Flast, the Court has refused to expand taxpayer stand-
ing. Litigants seeking standing as taxpayers to challenge legisla-
tion permitting the CIA to withhold from the public detailed infor-
mation about its expenditures as a violation of Article I, § 9, cl. 7,
and to challenge certain Members of Congress from holding commis-
sions in the reserves as a violation of Article I, § 6, cl. 2, were de-
nied standing, in the former cases because their challenge was not
to an exercise of the taxing and spending power and in the latter
because their challenge was not to legislation enacted under Ar-
ticle I, § 8, but rather was to executive action in permitting Mem-
bers to maintain their reserve status.390 An organization promoting
church-state separation was denied standing to challenge an execu-
tive decision to donate surplus federal property to a church-related
college, both because the contest was to executive action under valid
legislation and because the property transfer was not pursuant to
a Taxing and Spending Clause exercise but was taken under the
Property Clause of Article IV, § 3, cl. 2.391 The Court also refused
to create an exception for Commerce Clause violations to the gen-
eral prohibition on taxpayer standing.392
    Most recently, a Court plurality held that, even in Establish-
ment Clause cases, there is no taxpayer standing where the expen-
diture of funds that is challenged was not specifically authorized
by Congress, but came from general executive branch appropria-

    390  United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 (1974); Schlesinger v. Reservists
Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 227–28 (1974). Richardson in its generalized
grievance constriction does not apply when Congress confers standing on litigants.
FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998). When Congress confers standing on “any person
aggrieved” by the denial of information required to be furnished them, it matters
not that most people will be entitled and will thus suffer a “generalized grievance,”
the statutory entitlement is sufficient. Id. at 21–25.
     391 Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United, 454 U.S. 464 (1982). In

Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 353 n.3 (1996), the Court played down the “serious
and adversarial treatment” prong of standing and strongly reasserted the separation-
of-powers value of keeping courts within traditional bounds. The Court again took
this approach in Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2553,
2569 (2007), finding that “Flast itself gave too little weight to [separation-of-powers]
concerns.”
     392 DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 347–49 (2006) (standing de-

nied to taxpayer claim that state tax credit given to vehicle manufacturer violated
the Commerce Clause).
