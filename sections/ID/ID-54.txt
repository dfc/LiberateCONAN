proceedings—here, Combatant Status Review Tribunals or (CSRTs)—
rather than proceedings before a court of law.282 The Court also ex-
pressed concern that the detentions had, in some cases, lasted as
long as six years without significant judicial oversight.283 The Court
further noted the limitations at the CSRT stage on a detainee’s abil-
ity to find and present evidence to challenge the government’s case,
the unavailability of assistance of counsel, the inability of a de-
tainee to access certain classified government records which could
contain critical allegations against him, and the admission of hear-
say evidence. While reserving judgment as to whether the CSRT
process itself comports with due process, the Court found that the
appeals process for these decisions, assigned to the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, did not contain the
means necessary to correct errors occurring in the CSRT pro-
cess.284
     Habeas Corpus: The Process of the Writ.—A petition for a
writ of habeas corpus is filed by or on behalf of a person in “cus-
tody,” a concept which has been expanded so much that it is no lon-
ger restricted to actual physical detention in jail or prison.285 The
writ acts upon the custodian, not the prisoner, so the issue under
the jurisdictional statute is whether the custodian is within the dis-
trict court’s jurisdiction.286 Traditionally, the proceeding could not
be used to secure an adjudication of a question which if deter-
mined in the petitioner’s favor would not result in his immediate
     282 Under the Detainee Treatment Act, Pub. L. 109–148, Title X, Congress granted

only a limited appeal right to determination made by the Executive Branch as to
“(I) whether the status determination of [a] Combatant Status Review Tribunal . . .
was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of De-
fense . . . and (ii) to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are
applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determi-
nation is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.” § 1005(e)(2)(C).

     284 The Court focused in particular on the inability of the reviewing court to

admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced in the
prior proceeding. The Court also listed other potential constitutional infirmities in
the review process, including the absence of provisions empowering the D.C. Circuit
to order release from detention, and not permitting petitioners to challenge the Presi-
dent’s authority to detain them indefinitely.
     285 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(c), 2254(a). “Custody” does not mean one must be con-

fined; a person on parole or probation is in custody. Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S.
236 (1963). A person on bail or on his own recognizance is in custody, Justices of
Boston Mun. Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 300–301 (1984); Lefkowitz v. Newsome,
420 U.S. 283, 291 n.8 (1975); Hensley v. Municipal Court, 411 U.S. 345 (1973), and
Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, 410 U.S. 484 (1973), held that an inmate of
an Alabama prison was also sufficiently in the custody of Kentucky authorities who
had lodged a detainer with Alabama to obtain the prisoner upon his release.
     286 Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, 410 U.S. 484, 494–95 (1973) (issue is

whether “the custodian can be reached by service of process”). See also Rasul v. Bush,

of habeas petitions from prisoners held at U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba);
