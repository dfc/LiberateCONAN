tion,” nor, since the Court is merely interpreting the Constitution,
is there an “initial policy determination” not suitable for courts. Fi-
nally, “judicially . . . manageable standards” are present in the text
of the Constitution.664 The effect of Powell was to discard all the
Baker factors inhering in a political question, with the exception of
the textual commitment factor, and that was interpreted in such a
manner as seldom if ever to preclude a judicial decision on the mer-
its.
     The Doctrine Reappears.—Despite the apparent narrowing of
the doctrine in Baker and Powell, the Court has not abandoned it.
Reversing a lower federal court ruling subjecting the training and
discipline of National Guard troops to court review and supervi-
sion, the Court held that under Article I, § 8, cl. 16, the organizing,
arming, and disciplining of such troops are committed to Congress
and by congressional enactment to the Executive Branch. “It would
be difficult to think of a clearer example of the type of governmen-
tal action that was intended by the Constitution to be left to the
political branches, directly responsible—as the Judicial Branch is
not—to the elective process. Moreover, it is difficult to conceive of
an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less com-
petence. The complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the
composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are
essentially professional military judgments, subject always to civil-
ian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches.” 665
     The suggestion of the infirmity of the political question doc-
trine was rejected, since “because this doctrine has been held inap-
plicable to certain carefully delineated situations, it is no reason
for federal courts to assume its demise.” 666 In staying a grant of
remedial relief in another case, the Court strongly suggested that
the actions of political parties in national nominating conventions
may also present issues not meet for judicial resolution.667 A chal-

     664 395 U.S. at 548–549. With the formulation of Chief Justice Warren, compare

that of then-Judge Burger in the lower court. 395 F.2d 577, 591–96 (D.C. Cir. 1968).
     665 Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973). Similar prudential concerns seem

to underlay, though they did not provide the formal basis for, the decisions in O’Shea
v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 (1974), and Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality
League, 415 U.S. 605 (1974).
     666 413 U.S. at 11. Other considerations of justiciability, however, id. at 10, pre-

clude using the case as square precedent on political questions. Notice that in Scheuer
v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 249 (1974), the Court denied that the Gilligan v. Morgan
holding barred adjudication of damage actions brought against state officials by the
estates of students killed in the course of the conduct that gave rise to both cases.
     667 O’Brien v. Brown, 409 U.S. 1 (1972) (granting stay). The issue was mooted

by the passage of time and was not thereafter considered on the merits by the Court.
Id. at 816 (remanding to dismiss as moot). It was also not before the Court in Cous-
ins v. Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477 (1975), but it was alluded to there. See id. at 483 n.4,
