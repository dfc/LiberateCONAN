ests. It can sue to protect its own property interests,1038 and if it
sues for its own interest as owner of another state’s bonds, rather
than as an assignee for collection, jurisdiction exists.1039 Where a
state, in order to avoid the limitation of the Eleventh Amendment,
provided by statute for suit in the name of the state to collect on
the bonds of another state held by one of its citizens, it was re-
fused the right to sue.1040 Nor can a state sue the citizens of other
states on behalf of its own citizens to collect claims.1041
     The State as Parens Patriae.—The distinction between suits
brought by states to protect the welfare of their citizens as a whole
and suits to protect the private interests of individual citizens is
not easily drawn. Thus, in Oklahoma v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry.,1042
the state was refused permission to sue to enjoin unreasonable rate
charges by a railroad on the shipment of specified commodities, be-
cause the state was not engaged in shipping these commodities and
had no proprietary interest in them. But, in Georgia v. Pennsylva-
nia R.Co.,1043 a closely divided Court accepted a suit by the state,
suing as parens patriae and in its proprietary capacity—the latter
being treated by the Court as something of a makeweight—seeking
injunctive relief against 20 railroads on allegations that the rates
were discriminatory against the state and its citizens and their eco-
nomic interests and that the rates had been fixed through coercive
action by the northern roads against the southern lines in violation
of the Clayton Antitrust Act. For the Court, Justice Douglas ob-
served that the interests of a state for purposes of invoking the origi-
nal jurisdiction of the Court were not to be confined to those which
are proprietary but rather “embrace the so called ‘quasi-sovereign’
interests which . . . are ‘independent of and behind the titles of its
citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.’ ” 1044
     Discriminatory freight rates, the Justice continued, may cause
a blight no less serious than noxious gases in that they may arrest
the development of a state and put it at a competitive disadvan-

the defendant from emitting noxious gases from its works in Tennessee which caused
substantial damage in nearby areas of Georgia). In Alfred L. Snapp & Son v. Puerto
Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607–08 (1982), the Court attempted to enunciate
the standards by which to recognize permissible parens patriae assertions. See also
