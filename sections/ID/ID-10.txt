     In Evans v. Gore,33 the Court invalidated the application of a
1919 income tax law to a sitting federal judge, over the strong dis-
sent of Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis. This ruling was
extended in Miles v. Graham 34 to exempt the salary of a judge of
the Court of Claims appointed subsequent to the enactment of the
taxing act. Evans v. Gore was disapproved and Miles v. Graham
was in effect overruled in O’Malley v. Woodrough,35 where the Court
upheld section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, which extended the
application of the income tax to salaries of judges taking office af-
ter June 6, 1932. Such a tax was regarded neither as an unconsti-
tutional diminution of the compensation of judges nor as an encroach-
ment on the independence of the judiciary.36 To subject judges who
take office after a stipulated date to a nondiscriminatory tax laid
generally on an income, said the Court, “is merely to recognize that
judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in gov-
ernment does not generate an immunity from sharing with their
fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose Con-
stitution and laws they are charged with administering.” 37
     Formally overruling Evans v. Gore, the Court in United States
v. Hatter reaffirmed the principle that judges should “share the tax
burdens borne by all citizens.” 38 “[T]he potential threats to judicial
independence that underlie [the Compensation Clause] cannot jus-
tify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax.” 39
The Medicare tax, extended to all federal employees in 1982, is such
a non-discriminatory tax that may be applied to federal judges, the
Court held. The 1983 extension of a Social Security tax to then-
sitting judges was “a different matter,” however, because the judges
were required to participate while almost all other federal employ-
ees were given a choice about participation.40 Congress had not cured
the constitutional violation by a subsequent enactment that raised
judges’ salaries by an amount greater than the amount of Social
Security taxes that they were required to pay.41
