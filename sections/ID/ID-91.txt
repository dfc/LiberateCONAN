concept of Member standing, the Circuit then proceeded to curtail
it by holding that the equitable discretion of the court to deny re-
lief should be exercised in many cases in which a Member had stand-
ing but in which issues of separation of powers, political questions,
and other justiciability considerations counseled restraint.476 The sta-
tus of this issue thus remains in confusion.
     Member or legislator standing has been severely curtailed, al-
though not quite abolished, in Raines v. Byrd.477 Several Members
of Congress, who had voted against passage of the Line Item Veto
Act, sued in their official capacities as Members of Congress to in-
validate the law, alleging standing based on the theory that the stat-
ute adversely affected their constitutionally prescribed lawmaking
power.478 Emphasizing its use of standing doctrine to maintain
separation-of-powers principles, the Court adhered to its holdings
that, in order to possess the requisite standing, a person must es-
tablish that he has a “personal stake” in the dispute and that the
alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.479 Neither require-
ment, the Court held, was met by these legislators. First, the Mem-
bers did not suffer a particularized loss that distinguished them from
their colleagues or from Congress as an entity. Second, the Mem-
bers did not claim that they had been deprived of anything to which
they were personally entitled. “[A]ppellees’ claim of standing is based
on loss of political power, not loss of any private right, which would
make the injury more concrete. . . . If one of the Members were to
retire tomorrow, he would no longer have a claim; the claim would
be possessed by his successor instead. The claimed injury thus runs
(in a sense) with the Member’s seat, a seat which the Member holds
. . . as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal
power.” 480
     So, there is no such thing as Member standing? Not necessar-
ily so, because the Court turned immediately to preserving (at least

sue.” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 215 (1974).
But see Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 207 (D.C. Cir. 1977). In any event, the
Supreme Court’s decision vacating Goldwater deprives the Circuit’s language of
precedential effect. United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 39–40 (1950); O’Connor
v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 577 n.12 (1975).
    476 Riegle v. FOMC, 656 F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082

(1981).
    477 521 U.S. 811 (1997).
    478 The Act itself provided that “[a]ny Member of Congress or any individual

adversely affected” could sue to challenge the law. 2 U.S.C. § 692(a)(1). After failure
of this litigation, the Court in the following Term, on suits brought by claimants
adversely affected by the exercise of the veto, held the statute unconstitutional. Clin-
ton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998).
    479 521 U.S. at 819.
    480 521 U.S. at 821.
