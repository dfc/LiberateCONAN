ing of jurisdiction,1208 inherent judicial power,1209 and a theory, vari-
ously expressed, that the Supreme Court has “essential constitu-
tional functions” of judicial review that Congress may not impair
through jurisdictional limitations,1210 one can nonetheless see the
possibilities of restrictions on congressional power flowing from such
basic constitutional underpinnings as express prohibitions, separa-
tion of powers, and the nature of the judicial function.1211 Whether
because of the plethora of scholarly writing contesting the exis-
tence of unlimited congressional power or because of another rea-
son, the Court of late has taken to noting constitutional reserva-




     1208 This was Justice Story’s theory propounded in Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee,

14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 329–336 (1816). Nevertheless, Story apparently did not be-
lieve that the constitutional bestowal of jurisdiction was self-executing and accepted
the necessity of statutory conferral. White v. Fenner, 29 Fed. Cas. 1015 (No. 17,
547) (C.C.D.R.I. 1818) (Justice Story). In the present day, it has been argued that
the presence in the jurisdictional-grant provisions of Article III of the word “all” be-
fore the subject-matter grants—federal question, admiralty, public ambassadors –man-
dates federal court review at some level of these cases, whereas congressional discre-
tion exists with respect to party-defined jurisdiction, such as diversity. Amar, A Neo-
Federalist View of Article III: Separating the Two-Tiers of Federal Jurisdiction, 65
B.U. L. REV. 205 (1985); Amar, The Two-Tiered Structure of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
138 U. PA. L. REV. 1499 (1990). Rebuttal articles include Meltzer, The History and
Structure of Article III, id. at 1569; Redish, Text, Structure, and Common Sense in
the Interpretation of Article III, id. at 1633; and a response by Amar, id. at 1651.
An approach similar to Professor Amar’s is Clinton, A Mandatory View of Federal
Jurisdiction: A Guided Quest for the Original Understanding of Article III, 132 U.
PA. L. REV. 741 (1984); Clinton, Early Implementation and Departures from the Con-
stitutional Plan, 86 COLUM. L. REV. 1515 (1986). Though perhaps persuasive as an
original interpretation, both theories confront a large number of holdings and dicta
as well as the understandings of the early Congresses revealed in their actions. See
Casto, The First Congress’s Understanding of its Authority over the Federal Court’s
Jurisdiction, 26 B.C. L. REV. 1101 (1985).
     1209 Justice Brewer in his opinion for the Court in United States v. Detroit Tim-

ber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 339 (1906), came close to asserting an indepen-
dent, inherent power of the federal courts, at least in equity. See also Paine Lumber
Co. v. Neal, 244 U.S. 459, 473, 475–476 (1917) (Justice Pitney dissenting). The ac-
ceptance by the Court of the limitations of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, among other
decisions, contradicts these assertions.
     1210 The theory was apparently first developed in Ratner, Congressional Power

Over the Appellate Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, 109 U. PA. L. REV. 157 (1960).
See also Ratner, Majoritarian Constraints on Judicial Review: Congressional Con-
trol of Supreme Court Jurisdiction, 27 VILL. L. REV. 929 (1981–82). The theory was
endorsed by Attorney General William French Smith as the view of the Department
of Justice. 128 CONG. REC. 9093–9097 (1982) (Letter to Hon. Strom Thurmond).
     1211 An extraordinary amount of writing has been addressed to the issue, only a

fraction of which is touched on here. See Hart & Wechsler (6th ed.), supra at 275–
324.
