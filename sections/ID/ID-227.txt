when Congress enacts a law and declares a national policy, that
policy is as much Connecticut’s and every other state’s as it is of
the collective United States.1261 The Court’s suggestion that the act
could be enforced “as of right, in the courts of the States when their
jurisdiction, as prescribed by local laws, is adequate to the occa-
sion,” 1262 leaving the impression that state practice might in some
instances preclude enforcement in state courts, was given body when
the Court upheld New York’s refusal to adjudicate an FELA claim
that fell in a class of cases in which claims under state law would
not be entertained.1263 “[T]here is nothing in the Act of Congress
that purports to force a duty upon such Courts as against an other-
wise valid excuse.” 1264 However, “[a]n excuse that is inconsistent
with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse: The Supremacy
Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law
because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize
the superior authority of its source.” 1265
    The fact that a state statute divests its courts of jurisdiction
not only over a disfavored federal claim, but also over an identical
state claim, does not ensure that the “state law will be deemed a
neutral rule of judicial administration and therefore a valid excuse
for refusing to entertain a federal cause of action.” 1266 “Although
the absence of discrimination [in its treatment of federal and state
law] is necessary to our finding a state law neutral, it is not suffi-
cient. A jurisdictional rule cannot be used as a device to undermine
federal law, no matter how evenhanded it may appear.” 1267
    In Testa v. Katt,1268 the Court unanimously held that state courts,
at least with regard to claims and cases analogous to claims and
cases enforceable in those courts under state law, are required to

Ry., 292 U.S. 230 (1934). It appears that generally state procedure must yield to
federal when it would make a difference in outcome. Compare Brown v. Western Ry.
