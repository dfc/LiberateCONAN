sides, Congress is not bound, and it would, perhaps, be inexpedi-
ent, to enlarge the jurisdiction of the federal courts, to every sub-
ject, in every form, which the constitution might warrant.” 1188 Applying
§ 11, the Court held that the circuit court had lacked jurisdiction.
    Chief Justice Marshall himself soon made similar asser-
tions,1189 and the early decisions of the Court continued to be sprinkled
with assumptions that the power of Congress to create inferior fed-
eral courts necessarily implied “the power to limit jurisdiction of
those Courts to particular objects.” 1190 In Cary v. Curtis,1191 a stat-
ute making final the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury in
certain tax disputes was challenged as an unconstitutional depriva-
tion of the judicial power of the courts. The Court decided other-
wise. “[T]he judicial power of the United States, although it has its
origin in the Constitution, is (except in enumerated instances appli-
cable exclusively to this court), dependent for its distribution and
organization, and for the modes of its exercise, entirely upon the
action of Congress, who possess the sole power of creating tribu-
nals (inferior to the Supreme Court), for the exercise of the judicial
power, and of investing them with jurisdiction either limited, con-
current, or exclusive, and of withholding jurisdiction from them in
the exact degrees and character which to Congress may seem proper
for the public good.” 1192 Five years later, the validity of the as-
signee clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789 1193 was placed in issue
in Sheldon v. Sill,1194 in which diversity of citizenship had been cre-
ated by assignment of a negotiable instrument. It was argued that,
because the right of a citizen of any state to sue citizens of another
flowed directly from Article III, Congress could not restrict that right.
Unanimously, the Court rejected this contention and held that be-
cause the Constitution did not create inferior federal courts but rather
authorized Congress to create them, Congress was also empowered
to define their jurisdiction and to withhold jurisdiction of any of the
    1188 4 U.S. at 10.
    1189 In Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cr.) 75, 93 (1807), Marshall observed that
“courts which are created by written law, and whose jurisdiction is defined by writ-
ten law, cannot transcend that jurisdiction.”
    1190 United States v. Hudson & Goodwin, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 32, 33 (1812). Justice

Johnson continued: “All other Courts [besides the Supreme Court] created by the
general government possess no jurisdiction but what is given them by the power
that creates them, and can be vested with none but what the power ceded to the
general government will authorize them to confer.” See also Rhode Island v. Massa-
chusetts, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 657, 721–722 (1838).
    1191 44 U.S. (3 How.) 236 (1845).
    1192 44 U.S. at 244–45. Justices McLean and Story dissented, arguing that the

right to construe the law in all matters of controversy is of the essence of judicial
power. Id. at 264.

    1194 49 U.S. (8 How.) 441 (1850).
