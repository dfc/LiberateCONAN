exception to the mandate of the res judicata statute.1301 An excep-
tion to § 1738 “will not be recognized unless a later statute con-
tains an express or implied partial repeal.” 1302 Thus, a claimant who
pursued his employment discrimination remedies through state ad-
ministrative procedures, as the federal law requires her to do (within
limits), and then appealed an adverse state agency decision to state
court will be precluded from bringing her federal claim to federal
court, since the federal court is obligated to give the state court de-
cision “full faith and credit.” 1303
     Closely related is the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, holding that fed-
eral subject-matter jurisdiction of federal district courts does not
extend to review of state court judgments.1304 The Supreme Court,
not federal district courts, has such appellate jurisdiction. The doc-
trine thus prevents losers in state court from obtaining district court
review, but “does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doc-
trine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow federal courts
to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court ac-
tions.” 1305
    Three-Judge Court Act.—When the Court in Ex parte Young 1306
held that federal courts were not precluded by the Eleventh Amend-
ment from restraining state officers from enforcing state laws deter-
mined to be in violation of the federal Constitution, serious efforts
were made in Congress to take away the authority thus asserted,
but the result instead was legislation providing that suits in which
an interlocutory injunction was sought against the enforcement of
state statutes by state officers were to be heard by a panel of three
federal judges, rather than by a single district judge, with appeal
direct to the Supreme Court.1307 The provision was designed to as-
suage state feeling by vesting such determinations in a court more
prestigious than a single-judge district court, to assure a more au-
thoritative determination, and to prevent the assertion of indi-
    1301 449 U.S. at 96–105. In England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375

U.S. 411 (1964), the Court held that, when parties are compelled to go to state court
under Pullman abstention, either party may reserve the federal issue and thus be
enabled to return to federal court without being barred by res judicata.
    1302 Kramer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 468 (1982).
    1303 456 U.S. 468–76. There were four dissents. Id. at 486 (Justices Blackmun,

Brennan, and Marshall), 508 (Stevens).
    1304 The doctrine derives its name from Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S.

413 (1923), and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).
    1305 Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005)

(Rooker-Feldman has no application when federal court proceedings have been initi-
ated prior to state court proceedings; preclusion law governs in that situation).
    1306 209 U.S. 123 (1908).
    1307 36 Stat. 557 (1910). The statute was amended in 1925 to apply to requests

for permanent injunctions, 43 Stat. 936, and again in 1937 to apply to constitu-
tional attacks on federal statutes. 50 Stat. 752.
