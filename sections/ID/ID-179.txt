case, are constitutionally void.” 985 The Court rejected the conten-
tion that the doctrine of sovereign immunity should be relaxed as
inapplicable to suits for specific relief as distinguished from dam-
age suits, saying: “The Government, as representative of the com-
munity as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff
who presents a disputed question of property or contract right.” 986
    Suits against officers involving the doctrine of sovereign immu-
nity have been classified into four general groups by Justice Frank-
furter. First, there are those cases in which the plaintiff seeks an
interest in property which belongs to the government or calls “for
an assertion of what is unquestionably official authority.” 987 Such
suits, of course, cannot be maintained.988 Second, cases in which
action adverse to the interests of a plaintiff is taken under an un-
constitutional statute or one alleged to be so. In general these suits

     985 337 U.S. at 701–02. This rule was applied in Goldberg v. Daniels, 231 U.S.

218 (1913), which also involved a sale of government surplus property. After the Sec-
retary of the Navy rejected the highest bid, plaintiff sought mandamus to compel
delivery. This suit was held to be against the United States. See also Perkins v. Lukens
Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113 (1940), which held that prospective bidders for contracts de-
rive no enforceable rights against a federal official for an alleged misinterpretation
of his government’s authority on the ground that an agent is answerable only to his
principal for misconstruction of instructions, given for the sole benefit of the princi-
pal. In Larson, the Court not only refused to follow Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S. 536
(1926), but in effect overruled it. Goltra involved an attempt of the government to
repossess barges which it had leased under a contract reserving the right to repos-
sess in certain circumstances. A suit to enjoin repossession was held not to be a suit
against the United States on the ground that the actions were personal and in the
nature of a trespass. Also decided in harmony with the Larson decision are the fol-
lowing, wherein the suit was barred as being against the United States: (1) Malone
v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643 (1962), a suit to eject a Forest Service Officer from land
occupied by him in his official capacity under a claim of title from the United States;
and (2) Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57 (1963), an original action by Hawaii against
the Director of the Budget for an order directing him to determine whether a parcel
of federal land could be conveyed to that state. In Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609
(1963), the Court ruled that inasmuch as the storing and diverting of water at the
Friant Dam resulted, not in a trespass, but in a partial, although a casual day-by-
day, taking of water rights of claimants along the San Joaquin River below the dam,
a suit to enjoin such diversion by Federal Bureau of Reclamation officers was an
action against the United States, for grant of the remedy sought would force aban-
donment of a portion of a project authorized and financed by Congress, and would
prevent fulfillment of contracts between the United States and local Water Utility
Districts. Damages were recoverable in a suit under the Tucker Act. 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a).
     986 337 U.S. at 703–04. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting, would have applied the

rule of the Lee case. See Pub. L. 94–574, 1, 90 Stat. 2721 (1976), amending 5 U.S.C.
§ 702 (action seeking relief, except for money damages, against officer, employee, or
agency not to be dismissed as action against United States).
     987 Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 709–710 (1949) (dissent-

ing opinion).
     988 Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U.S. 60 (1906); Louisiana v. McAdoo, 234 U.S. 627

(1914); Wells v. Roper, 246 U.S. 335 (1918). See also Belknap v. Schild, 161 U.S. 10
(1896); International Postal Supply Co. v. Bruce, 194 U.S. 601 (1904).
