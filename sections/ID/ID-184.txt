matter, the Court evaluated the possible rules and chose the one
easiest to apply and least likely to lead to continuing disputes.
    In general, in taking jurisdiction of these suits, along with those
involving boundaries and the diversion or pollution of water re-
sources, the Supreme Court proceeded upon the liberal construc-
tion of the term “controversies between two or more States” enun-
ciated in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts,1013 and fortified by Chief
Justice Marshall’s dictum in Cohens v. Virginia,1014 concerning ju-
risdiction because of the parties to a case, that “it is entirely unim-
portant, what may be the subject of controversy. Be it what it may,
these parties have a constitutional right to come into the Courts of
the Union.” 1015
     Cases of Which the Court Has Declined Jurisdiction.—In
other cases, however, the Court, centering its attention upon the
elements of a case or controversy, has declined jurisdiction. In Ala-
bama v. Arizona,1016 where Alabama sought to enjoin nineteen states
from regulating or prohibiting the sale of convict-made goods, the
Court went far beyond holding that it had no jurisdiction, and indi-
cated that jurisdiction of suits between states will be exercised only
when absolutely necessary, that the equity requirements in a suit
between states are more exacting than in a suit between private
persons, that the threatened injury to a plaintiff state must be of
great magnitude and imminent, and that the burden on the plain-
tiff state to establish all the elements of a case is greater than the
burden generally required by a petitioner seeking an injunction in
cases between private parties.
    Pursuing a similar line of reasoning, the Court declined to take
jurisdiction of a suit brought by Massachusetts against Missouri and
certain of its citizens to prevent Missouri from levying inheritance
taxes upon intangibles held in trust in Missouri by resident trust-
ees. In holding that the complaint presented no justiciable contro-
versy, the Court declared that to constitute such a controversy, the
    1013 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 657 (1838).
    1014 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821).
    1015 19 U.S. at 378. See Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 368 U.S. 71,

79–80 (1961); Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U.S. 674, 677 (1965); Pennsylvania v. New
York, 407 U.S. 206 (1972).
    1016 291 U.S. 286 (1934). The Court in recent years, with a significant caseload

problem, has been loath to permit filings of original actions where the parties might
be able to resolve their disputes in other courts, even in cases in which the jurisdic-
tion over the particular dispute is exclusively original. Arizona v. New Mexico, 425
U.S. 794 (1976) (dispute subject of state court case brought by private parties); Cali-
fornia v. West Virginia, 454 U.S. 1027 (1981). But in Mississippi v. Louisiana, 506
U.S. 73 (1992), the Court’s reluctance to exercise original jurisdiction ran afoul of
the “uncompromising language” of 28 U.S.C. § 1251(a) giving the Court “original and
exclusive jurisdiction” of these kinds of suits.
