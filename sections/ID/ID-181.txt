preme Court of suits to which a state is a party had its origin in
experience. Prior to independence, disputes between colonies claim-
ing charter rights to territory were settled by the Privy Council.
Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was made “the last
resort on appeal” to resolve “all disputes and differences . . . be-
tween two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any
other cause whatever,” and to constitute what in effect were ad hoc
arbitral courts for determining such disputes and rendering a final
judgment therein. When the Philadelphia Convention met in 1787,
serious disputes over boundaries, lands, and river rights involved
ten states.995 It is hardly surprising, therefore, that during its first
60 years the only state disputes coming to the Supreme Court were
boundary disputes 996 or that such disputes constitute the largest
single number of suits between states. Since 1900, however, as the
result of the increasing mobility of population and wealth and the
effects of technology and industrialization, other types of cases have
occurred with increasing frequency.
     Boundary Disputes: The Law Applied.—Of the earlier ex-
amples of suits between states, that between New Jersey and New
York 997 is significant for the application of the rule laid down ear-
lier in Chisholm v. Georgia that the Supreme Court may proceed
ex parte if a state refuses to appear when duly summoned. The long
drawn out litigation between Rhode Island and Massachusetts is of
even greater significance for its rulings, after the case had been pend-
ing for seven years, that though the Constitution does not extend
the judicial power to all controversies between states, yet it does
not exclude any,998 that a boundary dispute is a justiciable and not
a political question,999 and that a prescribed rule of decision is un-
necessary in such cases. On the last point, Justice Baldwin stated:
“The submission by the sovereigns, or states, to a court of law or
equity, of a controversy between them, without prescribing any rule
of decision, gives power to decide according to the appropriate law
of the case (11 Ves. 294); which depends on the subject-matter, the
source and nature of the claims of the parties, and the law which
governs them. From the time of such submission, the question ceases
to be a political one, to be decided by the sic volo, sic jubeo, of po-
