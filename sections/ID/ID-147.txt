solely on the basis of federal incorporation in 1882,789 deprived rail-
roads holding federal charters of this right in 1915,790 and finally
in 1925 removed from federal jurisdiction all suits brought by fed-
erally chartered corporations on the sole basis of such incorpora-
tion, except where the United States holds at least half of the stock.791
     Federal Questions Resulting from Special Jurisdictional
Grants.—In the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, Con-
gress authorized federal courts to entertain suits for violation of col-
lective bargaining agreements without respect to the amount in con-
troversy or the citizenship of the parties.792 Although it is likely that
Congress meant no more than that labor unions could be suable in
law or equity, in distinction from the usual rule, the Court con-
strued the grant of jurisdiction to be more than procedural and to
empower federal courts to apply substantive federal law, divined and
fashioned from the policy of national labor laws, in such suits.793
State courts are not disabled from hearing actions brought under
the section,794 but they must apply federal law.795 Developments un-
der this section illustrate the substantive importance of many juris-
dictional grants and indicate how the workload of the federal courts
may be increased by unexpected interpretations of such grants.796

      793 Textile Workers of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957). Earlier the

Court had given the section a restricted reading in Association of Employees v.
Westinghouse Electric Corp., 348 U.S. 437 (1955), at least in part because of consti-
tutional doubts that § 301 cases in the absence of diversity of citizenship presented
a federal question sufficient for federal jurisdiction. Id. at 449–52, 459–61 (opinion
of Justice Frankfurter). In Lincoln Mills, the Court resolved this difficulty by ruling
that federal law was at issue in § 301 suits and thus cases arising under § 301 pre-
sented federal questions. 353 U.S. at 457. The particular holding of Westinghouse,
that no jurisdiction exists under § 301 for suits to enforce personal rights of employ-
ees claiming unpaid wages, was overturned in Smith v. Evening News Ass’n, 371
U.S. 195 (1962).
      794 Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502 (1962).
      795 Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95 (1962). State law is not, however,

to be totally disregarded. “State law, if compatible with the purpose of § 301, may
be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy
. . . . Any state law applied, however, will be absorbed as federal law and will not
be an independent source of private rights.” Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,
353 U.S. 448, 457 (1957).
      796 For example, when federal regulatory statutes create new duties without ex-

plicitly creating private federal remedies for their violation, the readiness or unreadi-
ness of the federal courts to infer private causes of action is highly significant. Al-
though inference is an acceptable means of judicial enforcement of statutes, e.g., Texas
& Pacific Ry. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33 (1916), the Court began broadly to construe
statutes to infer private actions only with J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426 (1964).
See Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975). More recently, influenced by a separation of
powers critique of implication by Justice Powell, the Court drew back and asserted
