prevented.1201 The Court seemed to experience no difficulty in up-
holding the Act,1202 and it has liberally applied it through the years.1203
     Congress’s power to confer, withhold, and restrict jurisdiction
is clearly revealed in the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 1204
and in the cases arising from it. Fearful that the price control pro-
gram might be nullified by injunctions, Congress provided for a spe-
cial court in which persons could challenge the validity of price regu-
lations issued by the government with appeal from the Emergency
Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court. The basic constitutionality
of the Act was sustained in Lockerty v. Phillips.1205 In Yakus v. United
States,1206 the Court upheld the provision of the Act which con-
ferred exclusive jurisdiction on the special court to hear challenges
to any order or regulation and foreclosed a plea of invalidity of any
such regulation or order as a defense to a criminal proceeding un-
der the Act in the regular district courts. Although Justice Rutledge
protested in dissent that this provision conferred jurisdiction on dis-
trict courts from which essential elements of the judicial power had
been abstracted,1207 Chief Justice Stone for the Court declared that
the provision presented no novel constitutional issue.

The Theory Reconsidered
     Despite the breadth of the language of many of the previously
cited cases, the actual holdings constitute something less than an
affirmance of plenary congressional power to do anything it desires
by manipulation of jurisdiction, and, indeed, the cases reflect cer-
tain limitations. Setting to one side various formulations that lack
textual and subsequent judicial support, such as mandatory vest-

    1201  47 Stat. 70 (1932), 29 U.S.C. §§ 101–115.
    1202  In Lauf v. E.G. Shinner & Co., 303 U.S. 323, 330 (1938), the Court simply
declared: “There can be no question of the power of Congress thus to define and
limit the jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the United States.”
     1203 E.g., New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., 303 U.S. 552 (1938); Broth-

erhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & I. R.R., 353 U.S. 30 (1957); Boys
Markets v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.S. 235 (1970).
     1204 56 Stat. 23 (1942).
     1205 319 U.S. 182 (1943).
     1206 321 U.S. 414 (1944).
     1207 321 U.S. at 468. In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987),

purportedly in reliance on Yakus and other cases, the Court held that a collateral
challenge must be permitted to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of
a criminal offense where effective judicial review of the deportation order had been
denied. A statutory scheme similar to that in Yakus was before the Court in Adamo
Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U.S. 275 (1978), but statutory construction en-
abled the Court to pass by constitutional issues that were not perceived to be insig-
nificant. See esp. id. at 289 (Justice Powell concurring). See also Harrison v. PPG
Industries, 446 U.S. 578 (1980), and id. at 594 (Justice Powell concurring).
