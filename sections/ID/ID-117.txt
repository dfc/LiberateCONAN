in fact led to the capitulation of the other faction, thus making an

     The Doctrine Before Baker v. Carr.—Over the years, the po-
litical question doctrine has been applied to preclude adjudication
of a variety of other issues. In particular, prior to Baker v. Carr,624
cases challenging the distribution of political power through appor-
tionment and districting,625 weighted voting,626 and restrictions on
political action 627 were held to present nonjusticiable political ques-
tions. Certain factors appear more or less consistently through most
of the cases decided before Baker, and it is perhaps best to indicate
the cases and issues deemed political before attempting to isolate
these factors.
     1. Republican Form of Government. By far the most consistent
application of the doctrine has been in cases in which litigants as-
serted claims under the republican form of government clause.628
The attacks were generally either on the government of the state
itself 629 or involved a challenge regarding the manner in which it
had acted.630 There have, however, been cases involving this clause
in which the Court has reached the merits.631
     2. Recognition of Foreign States. Although there is language in
the cases that would, if applied, serve to make all cases touching
    623  48 U.S. at 44.
    624  369 U.S. 186 (1962).
     625 Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549 (1946); Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804

(1947).
     626 South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276 (1950) (county unit system for election of state-

wide officers with vote heavily weighted in favor of rural, lightly populated coun-
ties).
     627 MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281 (1948) (signatures on nominating peti-

tions must be spread among counties of unequal population).

Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900).
     630 Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118 (1912) (challenging tax initia-

tive); Kiernan v. City of Portland, 223 U.S. 151 (1912) (attacks on initiative and
referendum); Marshall v. Dye, 231 U.S. 250 (1913) (state constitutional amendment
procedure); O’Neill v. Leamer, 239 U.S. 244 (1915) (delegation to court to form drain-
age districts); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565 (1916) (submission of
legislation to referendum); Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U.S. 219 (1917)
(workmen’s compensation); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District,
281 U.S. 74 (1930) (concurrence of all but one justice of state high court required to
invalidate statute); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U.S. 608 (1937) (delega-
tion of legislative powers).
     631 All the cases, however, predate the application of the doctrine in Pacific States

Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118 (1912). See Attorney General of the State of Michi-
gan ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, 199 U.S. 233, 239 (1905) (legislative creation and altera-
tion of school districts “compatible” with a republican form of government); Forsyth
v. City of Hammond, 166 U.S. 506, 519 (1897) (delegation of power to court to deter-
