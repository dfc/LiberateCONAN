out a license. Despite the issuance of a special mandate to a local
court to discharge the missionaries, they were not released, and the
state’s governor loudly proclaimed resistance. Consequently, the two
remained in jail until they agreed to abandon further efforts for their
discharge by federal authority and to leave the state, whereupon
the governor pardoned them.
    Use of State Courts in Enforcement of Federal Law.—
Although the states’ rights proponents in the Convention and in the
First Congress wished to leave to the state courts the enforcement
of federal law and rights rather than to create inferior federal
courts,1253 it was not long before they or their successors began to
argue that state courts could not be required to adjudicate cases
based on federal law. The practice in the early years was to make
the jurisdiction of federal courts generally concurrent with that of
state courts,1254 and early Congresses imposed positive duties on
state courts to enforce federal laws.1255 Reaction set in out of hostil-
ity to the Embargo Acts, the Fugitive Slave Law, and other mea-
sures,1256 and, in Prigg v. Pennsylvania,1257 involving the Fugitive
Slave Law, the Court indicated that the states could not be com-
pelled to enforce federal law. After a long period, however, Con-
gress resumed its former practice, 1258 which the Court sus-
tained,1259 and it went even further in the Federal Employers’ Liability
Act by not only giving state courts concurrent jurisdiction but also
by prohibiting the removal of cases begun in state courts to the fed-
eral courts.1260
    When Connecticut courts refused to enforce an FELA claim on
the ground that to do so was contrary to the public policy of the
state, the Court held on the basis of the Supremacy Clause that,

     1255 E.g., Carriage Tax Act, 1 Stat. 373 (1794); License Tax on Wine & Spirits

Act, 1 Stat. 376 (1794); Fugitive Slave Act, 1 Stat. 302 (1794); Naturalization Act of
1795, 1 Stat. 414; Alien Enemies Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 577. State courts in 1799 were
vested with jurisdiction to try criminal offenses against the postal laws. 1 Stat. 733,
28. The Act of March 3, 1815, 3 Stat. 244, vested state courts with jurisdiction of
complaints, suits, and prosecutions for taxes, duties, fines, penalties, and forfei-
tures. See Warren, Federal Criminal Laws and State Courts, 38 HARV. L. REV. 545,
577–581 (1925).

Wheat.) 1, 69 (1820) (Justice Story dissenting); United States v. Bailey, 34 U.S. (9
Pet.) 238, 259 (1835) (Justice McLean dissenting). However, the Court held that states
could exercise concurrent jurisdiction if they wished. Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S.
