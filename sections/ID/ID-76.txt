    Constitutional Standards: Injury in Fact, Causation, and
Redressability.—Although the Court has been inconsistent, it has
now settled upon the rule that “at an irreducible minimum” the con-
stitutional requisites under Article III for the existence of standing
are that the plaintiff must personally have: 1) suffered some actual
or threatened injury; 2) that injury can fairly be traced to the chal-
lenged action of the defendant; and 3) that the injury is likely to
be redressed by a favorable decision.400 For a time, the actual or
threatened injury prong included an additional requirement that such
injury be the product of “a wrong which directly results in the vio-
lation of a legal right” 401 such as “one of property, one arising out
of contract, one protected against tortuous invasion, or one founded
in a statute which confers a privilege.” 402 It became apparent, how-
ever, that the “legal right” language was “demonstrably circular: if
the plaintiff is given standing to assert his claims, his interest is
legally protected; if he is denied standing, his interest is not le-
gally protected.” 403 Further, the observable tendency of the Court
was to find standing in cases which were grounded in injuries far
removed from property rights.404
    In any event, the “legal rights” requirement has now been dis-
pensed with. Rejection of this doctrine occurred in two administra-
tive law cases in which the Court announced that parties had stand-
ing when they suffered “injury in fact” to some interest, “economic

what a redressable “personal stake” is in class actions in which the lead plaintiff ’s
merits claim has become moot. Id. at 404 n.11, reserving full consideration of the
dissent’s argument at 401 n.1, 420–21.
