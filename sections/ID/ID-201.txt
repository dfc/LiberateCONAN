B is applicable, perhaps because a contract was made there or a
tort was committed there, the federal court is to apply State A’s
conception of State B’s law.1113
     The greatest difficulty in applying the Erie doctrine has been
in cases in which issues of procedure were important.1114 The pro-
cess was initiated in 1945 when the Court held that a state statute
of limitations, which would have barred suit in state court, would
bar it in federal court, although as a matter of federal law the case
still could have been brought in federal court.1115 The Court re-
garded the substance-procedure distinction as immaterial. “[S]ince
a federal court adjudicating a state-created right solely because of
the diversity of citizenship of the parties is for that purpose, in ef-
fect, only another court of the State, it cannot afford recovery if the
right to recover is made unavailable by the State nor can it substan-
tially affect the enforcement of the right as given by the State.” 1116
The standard to be applied was compelled by the “intent” of Erie,
which “was to insure that, in all cases where a federal court is ex-
ercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of
the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should
be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the out-
come of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court.” 1117
The Court’s application of this standard created substantial doubt
that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure had any validity in diver-
sity cases.1118

     1114 Interestingly enough, 1938 marked what seemed to be a switching of posi-

tions vis-a-vis federal and state courts of substantive law and procedural law. Un-
der Tyson, federal courts in diversity actions were free to formulate a federal com-
mon law, while they were required by the Conformity Act, § 5, 17 Stat. 196 (1872),
to conform their procedure to that of the state in which the court sat. Erie then
ruled that state substantive law was to control in federal court diversity actions,
while by implication matters of procedure in federal court were subject to congres-
sional governance. Congress authorized the Court to promulgate rules of civil proce-
dure, 48 Stat. 1064 (1934), which it did in 1938, a few months after Erie was de-
cided. 302 U.S. 783.
