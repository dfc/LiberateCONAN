Federal Rules of Civil Procedure thus judicially promulgated nei-
ther affect the substantive rights of litigants 327 nor alter the juris-
diction 328 of federal courts and the venue of actions therein 329 and,
thus circumscribed, have been upheld as valid.
     Limitations to The Rule Making Power.—The principal func-
tion of court rules is that of regulating the practice of courts as re-
gards forms, the operation and effect of process, and the mode and
time of proceedings. However, rules are sometimes employed to state
in convenient form principles of substantive law previously estab-
lished by statutes or decisions. But no such rule “can enlarge or
restrict jurisdiction. Nor can a rule abrogate or modify the substan-
tive law.” This rule is applicable equally to courts of law, equity,
and admiralty, to rules prescribed by the Supreme Court for the
guidance of lower courts, and to rules “which lower courts make
for their own guidance under authority conferred.” 330 As incident
to the judicial power, courts of the United States possess inherent
authority to supervise the conduct of their officers, parties, wit-
nesses, counsel, and jurors by self-preserving rules for the protec-
tion of the rights of litigants and the orderly administration of jus-
tice.331
     The courts of the United States possess inherent equitable pow-
ers over their process to prevent abuse, oppression, and injustice,
and to protect their jurisdiction and officers in the protection of prop-
erty in the custody of law.332 Such powers are said to be essential
to and inherent in the organization of courts of justice.333 The courts
of the United States also possess inherent power to amend their
     327 However, the abolition of old rights and the creation of new ones in the course

of litigation conducted in conformance with these judicially prescribed federal rules
has been sustained as against the contention of a violation of substantive rights.
Sibbach v. Wilson, 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941).
     328 Cf. United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 589–590 (1941).
     329 Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438 (1946).
     330 Washington-Southern Nav. Co. v. Baltimore & P.S.B.C. Co., 263 U.S. 629, 635,

636 (1924). It is not for the Supreme Court to prescribe how the discretion vested in
a Court of Appeals should be exercised. As long as the latter court keeps within the
bounds of judicial discretion, its action is not reviewable. In re Burwell, 350 U.S.
521 (1956).
     331 McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 266 (1915); Griffin v. Thompson, 43 U.S. (2

How.) 244, 257 (1844). See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985) (court of appeal rule
conditioning appeal on having filed with the district court timely objections to a mas-
ter’s report). In Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 218 (1956), the Court, citing
McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332 (1943), asserted that this supervisory power
extends to policing the requirements of the Court’s rules with respect to the law
enforcement practices of federal agents. But compare United States v. Payner, 447
U.S. 727 (1980).
