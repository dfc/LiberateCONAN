writs or procedures is often left unexplored. In Missouri v. Jen-
kins,254 for example, the Court, rejecting a claim that a federal court
exceeded judicial power under Article III by ordering local authori-
ties to increase taxes to pay for desegregation remedies, declared
that “a court order directing a local government body to levy its
own taxes” is plainly a judicial act within the power of a federal
court.255 In the same case, the Court refused to rule on “the diffi-
cult constitutional issues” presented by the state’s claim that the
district court had exceeded its constitutional powers in a prior or-
der directly raising taxes, instead ruling that this order had vio-
lated principles of comity.256
    Common Law Powers of District of Columbia Courts.—
The portion of § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that authorized the
Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus in the exercise of its
original jurisdiction was held invalid in Marbury v. Madison,257 as
an unconstitutional enlargement of the Supreme Court’s original ju-
risdiction. After two more futile efforts to obtain a writ of manda-
mus, in cases in which the Court found that power to issue the writ
had not been vested by statute in the courts of the United States
except in aid of already existing jurisdiction,258 a litigant was suc-
cessful in Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes,259 in finding a court
that would take jurisdiction in a mandamus proceeding. This was
the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia,
which was held to have jurisdiction, on the theory that the com-
mon law, in force in Maryland when the cession of that part of the
state that became the District of Columbia was made to the United
States, remained in force in the District. At an early time, there-
fore, the federal courts established the rule that mandamus can be
issued only when authorized by a constitutional statute and within
the limits imposed by the common law and the separation of pow-
ers.260

levy taxes in order to open and operate a desegregated school system “is within the
court’s power if required to assure . . . petitioners that their constitutional rights
will no longer be denied them”).
