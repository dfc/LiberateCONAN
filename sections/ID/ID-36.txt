ceptions,177 the Court has consistently distinguished between crimi-
nal and civil contempt, the former being a vindication of the author-
ity of the courts and latter being the preservation and enforcement
of the rights of the parties. A civil contempt has been traditionally
viewed as the refusal of a person in a civil case to obey a manda-
tory order. It is incomplete in nature, may be purged by obedience
to the court order, and does not involve a sentence for a definite
period of time. The classic criminal contempt is one where the act
of contempt has been completed, punishment is imposed to vindi-
cate the authority of the court, and a person cannot by subsequent
action purge himself of such contempt.178
     The issue of whether a certain contempt is civil or criminal can
be of great importance. For instance, criminal contempt, unlike civil
contempt, implicates procedural rights attendant to prosecu-
tions.179 Or, in Ex parte Grossman,180 while holding that the Presi-
dent may pardon a criminal contempt, Chief Justice Taft noted in
dicta that such pardon power did not extend to civil contempt. Not-
withstanding the importance of distinguishing between the two, there
have been instances where defendants have been charged with both
civil and criminal contempt for the same act.181
     Long-standing doctrine regarding how courts should distin-
guish between civil and criminal contempt remains influential. In
Shillitani v. United States,182 defendants were sentenced by their
respective District Courts to two years imprisonment for contempt
of court, but the sentences contained a purge clause providing for
the unconditional release of the contemnors upon agreeing to tes-
    177  E.g., United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258 (1947).
    178  Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 441–443 (1911); Ex parte
Grossman, 267 U.S. 87 (1925). See also Bessette v. W.B. Conkey Co., 194 U.S. 324,
327–328 (1904).
     179 In Robertson v. United States ex rel. Watson, the Court had granted certio-

rari to consider a District of Columbia law that allowed a private individual to bring
a criminal contempt action in the congressionally established D.C. courts based on
a violation of a civil protective order. 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–6261, slip op. (2010). The
Court subsequently issued a per curiam order dismissing the writ of certiorari as
having been improvidently granted, but four Justices dissented. Writing in dissent,
Chief Justice Roberts thought it imperative to make clear that “[t]he terrifying force
of the criminal justice system may only be brought to bear against an individual by
society as a whole, through a prosecution brought of behalf of the government.” 560
U.S. ___, No. 08–6261, slip op. at 1 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Of particular
concern was how various protections in the Bill of Rights against government action
would play out in a privately brought action. Id. at 5–6.
     180 267 U.S. 87, 119–120 (1925). In an analogous case, the Court was emphatic

in a dictum that Congress cannot require a jury trial where the contemnor has failed
to perform a positive act for the relief of private parties, Michaelson v. United States
ex rel. Chicago, S.P., M. & Ry. Co., 266 U.S. 42, 65–66 (1924). But see Bloom v. Illi-
nois, 391 U.S. 194, 202 (1968).
     181 See United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 299 (1947).
     182 384 U.S. 364 (1966).
