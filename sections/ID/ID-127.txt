existence of court review of the constitutionality of legislation,684

      684 M. Farrand, supra at 97–98 (Gerry), 109 (King), 2 id. at 28 (Morris and per-

haps Sherman). 73 (Wilson), 75 (Strong, but the remark is ambiguous). 76 (Martin),
78 (Mason), 79 (Gorham, but ambiguous), 80 (Rutledge), 92–93 (Madison), 248
(Pinckney), 299 (Morris), 376 (Williamson), 391 (Wilson), 428 (Rutledge), 430 (Madi-
son), 440 (Madison), 589 (Madison); 3 id. at 220 (Martin). The only expressed oppo-
sition to judicial review came from Mercer with a weak seconding from Dickinson.
“Mr. Mercer . . . disapproved of the Doctrine that the Judges as expositors of the
Constitution should have authority to declare a law void. He thought laws ought to
be well and cautiously made, and then to be uncontroulable.” 2 id. at 298. “Mr. Dickinson
was strongly impressed with the remark of Mr. Mercer as to the power of the Judges
to set aside the law. He thought no such power ought to exist. He was at the same
time at a loss what expedient to substitute.” Id. at 299. Of course, the debates in
the Convention were not available when the state ratifying conventions acted, so
that the delegates could not have known these views about judicial review in order
to have acted knowingly about them. Views, were, however, expressed in the ratify-
ing conventions recognizing judicial review, some of them being uttered by Framers.
2 J. ELLIOT, DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION OF THE FEDERAL
CONSTITUTION (1836). 131 (Samuel Adams, Massachusetts), 196–197 (Ellsworth, Con-
necticut). 348, 362 (Hamilton, New York): 445–446. 478 (Wilson, Pennsylvania), 3
id. at 324–25, 539, 541 (Henry, Virginia), 480 (Mason, Virginia), 532 (Madison, Vir-
ginia), 570 (Randolph, Virginia); 4 id. at 71 (Steele, North Carolina), 156–157 (Davie,
North Carolina). In the Virginia convention, John Marshall observed if Congress “were
to make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated, it would be consid-
ered by the judge as an infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard
. . . They would declare it void . . . . To what quarter will you look for protection
from an infringement on the constitution, if you will not give the power to the judi-
ciary? There is no other body that can afford such a protection.” 3 id. at 553–54.
Both Madison and Hamilton similarly asserted the power of judicial review in their
campaign for ratification. THE FEDERALIST (J. Cooke ed. 1961). See Nos. 39 and 44, at
256, 305 (Madison), Nos. 78 and 81, at 524–530, 541–552 (Hamilton). The persons
supporting or at least indicating they thought judicial review existed did not consti-
tute a majority of the Framers, but the absence of controverting statements, with
the exception of the Mercer-Dickinson comments, indicates at least acquiescence if
not agreements by the other Framers.
      To be sure, subsequent comments of some of the Framers indicate an understand-
ing contrary to those cited in the convention. See, e.g., Charles Pinckney in 1799:
“On no subject am I more convinced, than that it is an unsafe and dangerous doc-
trine in a republic, ever to suppose that a judge ought to possess the right of ques-
tioning or deciding upon the constitutionality of treaties, laws, or any act of the leg-
islature. It is placing the opinion of an individual, or of two or three, above that of
both branches of Congress, a doctrine which is not warranted by the Constitution,
and will not, I hope, long have many advocates in this country.” STATE TRIALS OF THE
UNITED STATES DURING THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF WASHINGTON AND ADAMS 412 (F. Wharton
ed., 1849).
      Madison’s subsequent changes of position are striking. His remarks in the Phila-
delphia Convention, in the Virginia ratifying convention, and in The Federalist, cited
above, all unequivocally favor the existence of judicial review. And in Congress argu-
ing in support of the constitutional amendments providing a bill of rights, he ob-
served: “If they are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of jus-
tice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights;
they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Leg-
islature or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon
rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights,” 1

Yet, in a private letter in 1788, he wrote: “In the state constitutions and indeed in
the federal one also, no provision is made for the case of a disagreement in expound-
