Amendment rights.” 1325 The principle apparently established by the
Court was two-phased: a federal court should not abstain when there
is a facially unconstitutional statute infringing upon speech and ap-
plication of that statute discourages protected activities, and the court
should further enjoin the state proceedings when there is prosecu-
tion or threat of prosecution under an overbroad statute regulating
expression if the prosecution or threat of prosecution chills the ex-
ercise of freedom of expression.1326 These formulations were reaf-
firmed in Zwickler v. Koota,1327 in which a declaratory judgment was
sought with regard to a statute prohibiting anonymous election lit-
erature. The Court deemed abstention improper,1328 and further held
that adjudication for purposes of declaratory judgment is not hemmed
in by considerations attendant upon injunctive relief.1329
    The aftermath of Dombrowski and Zwickler was a considerable
expansion of federal-court adjudication of constitutional attack through
requests for injunctive and declaratory relief, which gradually spread
out from First Amendment areas to other constitutionally pro-
tected activities.1330 However, these developments were highly con-
troversial and, after three arguments on the issue, the Court in a
series of 1971 cases receded from its position and circumscribed the
discretion of the lower federal courts to a considerable and ever-
broadening degree.1331 The important difference between the 1971
cases and the Dombrowski-Zwickler line was that, in the latter there
were no prosecutions pending, whereas in the 1971 cases there were.
Nevertheless, the care with which Justice Black for the majority in
the 1971 cases undertook to distinguish Dombrowski signified a limi-
tation of its doctrine.
    Justice Black reviewed and reaffirmed the traditional rule of re-
luctance to interfere with state court proceedings except in extraor-
dinary circumstances. The holding in Dombrowski, as distin-
guished from some of its language, did not change the general rule,
because extraordinary circumstances had existed. Thus, Justice Black,
    1325  380 U.S. at 486, 487.
    1326  See Cameron v. Johnson, 381 U.S. 741 (1965); Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U.S.
611 (1968).
     1327 389 U.S. 241 (1967). The state criminal conviction had been reversed by a

state court on state law grounds and no new charge had been instituted.
     1328 It was clear that the statute could not be construed by a state court to ren-

der unnecessary a federal constitutional decision. 389 U.S. at 248–52.
     1329 389 U.S. at 254.
