United States territory (Guam) was found guilty of treason for acts done while the
enemy nation of which he was a citizen occupied such territory. Under English prec-
edents, an alien residing in British territory is open to conviction for high treason
on the theory that his allegiance to the Crown is not suspended by foreign occupa-
tion of the territory. DeJager v. Attorney General of Natal (1907), A.C., 96 L.T.R.
