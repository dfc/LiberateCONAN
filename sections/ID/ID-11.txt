specialized jurisdiction. These tribunals are like other Article III courts
in that they exercise “the judicial power of the United States,” and
only that power, that their judges must be appointed by the Presi-
dent and the Senate and must hold office during good behavior sub-
ject to removal by impeachment only, and that the compensation of
their judges cannot be diminished during their continuance in of-
fice. One example of such a court was the Commerce Court created
by the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910,42 which was given exclusive juris-
diction to enforce, inter alia, orders of the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission (except those involving money penalties and criminal pun-
ishment). This court actually functioned for less than three years,
being abolished in 1913.
     Another court of specialized jurisdiction, but created for a lim-
ited time only, was the Emergency Court of Appeals organized by
the Emergency Price Control Act of January 30, 1942.43 By the terms
of the statute, this court consisted of three or more judges desig-
nated by the Chief Justice from the judges of the United States dis-
trict courts and circuit courts of appeal. The Court was vested with
jurisdiction and the powers of a district court to hear appeals filed
within thirty days against denials of protests by the Price Adminis-
trator. The Court had exclusive jurisdiction to set aside regula-
tions, orders, or price schedules, in whole or in part, or to remand
the proceeding, but the court was tightly constrained in its treat-
ment of regulations. There was interplay with the district courts,
which were charged with authority to enforce orders issued under
the Act, although only the Emergency Court had jurisdiction to de-
termine the validity of such orders.44
    Other specialized courts are the Court of Appeals for the Fed-
eral Circuit, which is in many respects like the geographic circuits.

     44 In Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U.S. 182 (1943), the limitations on the use of in-

junctions, except the prohibition against interlocutory decrees, was unanimously sus-
tained.
     A similar court was created to be used in the enforcement of the economic con-
trols imposed by President Nixon in 1971. Pub. L. 92–210, 85 Stat. 743, 211(b). Al-
though controls ended in 1974, see 12 U.S.C. § 1904 note, Congress continued the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals and gave it new jurisdiction. Emergency
Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, Pub. L. 93–159, 87 Stat. 633, 15 U.S.C. § 754,
incorporating judicial review provisions of the Economic Stabilization Act. The Court
was abolished, effective March 29, 1993, by Pub. L. 102–572, 106 Stat. 4506.
     Another similar specialized court was created by § 209 of the Regional Rail Re-
organization Act, Pub. L. 93–226, 87 Stat. 999, 45 U.S.C. § 719, to review the final
system plan under the Act. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases (Blanchette v.
Connecticut Gen. Ins. Corp.), 419 U.S. 102 (1974).
