tion to navigable waters which form some link in an interstate or
international waterway or some link in commerce,905 but these date
from the time when it was thought the commerce power furnished
the support for congressional legislation in this field.
    Admiralty and Federalism.—Extension of admiralty and mari-
time jurisdiction to navigable waters within a state does not, how-
ever, of its own force include general or political powers of govern-
ment. Thus, in the absence of legislation by Congress, the states
through their courts may punish offenses upon their navigable wa-
ters and upon the sea within one marine league of the shore.906
    Determination of the boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction is a
judicial function, and “no State law can enlarge it, nor can an act
of Congress or a rule of court make it broader than the judicial power
may determine to be its true limits.” 907 But, as with other jurisdic-
tions of the federal courts, admiralty jurisdiction can only be exer-
cised under acts of Congress vesting it in federal courts.908
    The boundaries of federal and state competence, both legisla-
tive and judicial, in this area remain imprecise, and federal judi-
cial determinations have notably failed to supply definiteness. Dur-
ing the last century, the Supreme Court generally permitted two
overlapping systems of law to coexist in an uneasy relationship. The
federal courts in admiralty applied the general maritime law,909 supple-
mented in some instances by state law which created and defined
certain causes of action.910 Because the Judiciary Act of 1789 saved
to suitors common-law remedies, persons suing in state courts or
in federal courts in diversity of citizenship actions could look to
common-law and statutory doctrines for relief in maritime-related
tion. Ex parte Boyer, 109 U.S. 629 (1884); The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.S. 17 (1903).
In United States v. Appalachian Power Co., 311 U.S. 377 (1940), it was made clear
that maritime jurisdiction extends to include waterways which by reasonable im-
provement can be made navigable. “It has long been settled that the admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction of the United States includes all navigable waters within the
country.” Southern S.S. Co. v. NLRB, 316 U.S. 31, 41 (1942).
     905 E.g., The Daniel Ball, 77 U.S. (10 Wall.) 557, 563 (1870); The Montello, 87

U.S. (20 Wall.) 430, 441–42 (1874).
     906 United States v. Bevans, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 336 (1818); Manchester v. Mas-

sachusetts, 139 U.S. 240 (1891).

     908 Janney v. Columbia Ins. Co., 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 411, 418 (1825); The Lot-

tawanna, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 576 (1875).
     909 E.g., New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants’ Bank of Boston, 47 U.S.

(6 How.) 344 (1848); The Steamboat New York v. Rea, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 223 (1856);
The China, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 53 (1868); Ex parte McNiel, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 236 (1872);
La Bourgogne, 210 U.S. 95 (1908).
     910 The General Smith, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 438 (1819); The Lottawanna, 88 U.S.

(21 Wall.) 558 (1875) (enforcing state laws giving suppliers and repairmen liens on
ships supplied and repaired). Another example concerns state-created wrongful death
actions. The Hamilton, 207 U.S. 398 (1907).
