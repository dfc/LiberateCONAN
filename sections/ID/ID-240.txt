tory judgment, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, and thus result in a clearly improper
interference with the state proceedings.” 1336
     When, however, there is no pending state prosecution, the Court
is clear that “Our Federalism” is not offended if a plaintiff in a fed-
eral court is able to demonstrate a genuine threat of enforcement
of a disputed criminal statute, whether the statute is attacked on
its face or as applied, and becomes entitled to a federal declaratory
judgment.1337 And, in fact, when no state prosecution is pending, a
federal plaintiff need not demonstrate the existence of the Younger
factors to justify the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunc-
tion against prosecution under a disputed state statute.1338
    Of much greater significance is the extension of Younger to civil
proceedings in state courts 1339 and to state administrative proceed-
ings of a judicial nature.1340 The Younger principle applies when-
ever the state, or its officers or agency, is seeking to promote impor-
tant state interests in civil or administrative proceedings. Indeed,
the presence of important state interests in state proceedings has
been held to raise the Younger bar to federal relief in proceedings
which are entirely between private parties.1341 Comity, the Court
said, requires abstention when states have “important” interests in
pending civil proceedings between private parties,1342 as long as liti-
gants are not precluded from asserting federal rights. Thus, the Court
explained, “proper respect for the ability of state courts to resolve
federal questions presented in state court litigation mandates that
the federal court stay its hand.” 1343

    1338 Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922 (1975) (preliminary injunction may issue

to preserve status quo while court considers whether to grant declaratory relief);
Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977) (when declaratory relief is given, perma-
nent injunction may be issued if necessary to protect constitutional rights). How-
ever, it may not be easy to discern when state proceedings will be deemed to have
been instituted prior to the federal proceeding. E.g., Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332
(1975); Huffman v. Pursue. Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975); see also Hawaii Housing Auth.

that its orders and judgments are not rendered nugatory’ ” was deemed sufficient.
