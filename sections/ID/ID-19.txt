     Constitutional Status of the Court of Claims and the Courts
of Customs and Patent Appeals.—Although the Supreme Court
long accepted the Court of Claims as an Article III court,85 it later
ruled that court to be an Article I court and its judges without con-
stitutional protection of tenure and salary.86 Then, in the 1950s, Con-
gress statutorily declared that the Court of Claims, the Customs
Court, and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were Article
III courts,87 a questionable act under the standards the Court had
used to determine whether courts were legislative or constitu-
tional.88 In Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,89 however, five of seven partici-
pating Justices united to find that indeed the Court of Claims and
the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, at least, were constitu-
tional courts and their judges eligible to participate in judicial busi-
ness in other constitutional courts. Three Justices would have over-
ruled Bakelite and Williams and would have held that the courts
in question were constitutional courts.90 Whether a court is an Ar-
ticle III tribunal depends largely upon whether legislation establish-
ing it is in harmony with the limitations of that Article, specifi-
cally, “whether . . . its business is the federal business there specified
and its judges and judgments are allowed the independence there
expressly or impliedly made requisite.” When a court is created “to
carry into effect [federal] powers . . . over subject matter . . . and

ing required, a non-Article III bankruptcy judge could oversee such a jury trial. Id.
at 64. That question remains unresolved, both as a matter, first, of whether there is
statutory authorization for bankruptcy judges to conduct jury trials, and, second, if
there is, whether they may constitutionally do so. E.g., In re Ben Cooper, Inc., 896
F.2d 1394 (2d Cir. 1990), cert. granted, 497 U.S. 1023, vacated and remanded for
consideration of a jurisdictional issue, 498 U.S. 964 (1990), reinstated, 924 F.2d 36
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 928 (1991); In re Grabill Corp., 967 F.2d 1152 (7th
Cir. 1991), pet. for reh. en banc den., 976 F.2d 1126 (7th Cir. 1992).

     88 In Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U.S. 438. 459 (1929), Justice Van Devanter

refused to give any weight to the fact that Congress had bestowed life tenure on the
judges of the Court of Customs Appeals because that line of thought “mistakenly
assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention
of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was cre-
ated and in the jurisdiction conferred.”
