     Injunctions Under the Emergency Price Control Act of
1942.—Lockerty v. Phillips 318 justifies the same conclusion. Here
the validity of the special appeals procedure of the Emergency Price
Control Act of 1942 was sustained. This act provided for a special
Emergency Court of Appeals, which, subject to review by the Su-
preme Court, was given exclusive jurisdiction to determine the va-
lidity of regulations, orders, and price schedules issued by the Of-
fice of Price Administration. The Emergency Court and the Emergency
Court alone was permitted to enjoin regulations or orders of OPA,
and even it could enjoin such orders only after finding that the or-
der was not in accordance with law or was arbitrary or capricious.
The Emergency Court was expressly denied power to issue tempo-
rary restraining orders or interlocutory decrees, and in addition the
effectiveness of any permanent injunction it might issue was to be
postponed for thirty days. If review was sought in the Supreme Court
by certiorari, effectiveness was to be postponed until final disposi-
tion. A unanimous Court, speaking through Chief Justice Stone, de-
clared that there “is nothing in the Constitution which requires Con-
gress to confer equity jurisdiction on any particular inferior federal
court.” All federal courts, other than the Supreme Court, it was as-
serted, derive their jurisdiction solely from the exercise of the au-
thority to ordain and establish inferior courts conferred on Con-
gress by Article III, § 1, of the Constitution. This power, which Congress
is left free to exercise or not, was held to include the power “ ‘of
investing them with jurisdiction either limited, concurrent, or exclu-
sive, and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact de-
grees and character which to Congress may seem proper for the pub-
lic good.’ ” 319 Although the Court avoided passing upon the
constitutionality of the prohibition against interlocutory decrees, the
language of the Court was otherwise broad enough to support it,
as was the language of Yakus v. United States,320 which sustained
a different phase of the special procedure for appeals under the Emer-
gency Price Control Act.321

Columbia the only avenue of relief for States seeking to remove the coverage of the
Act.

U.S. 275 (1978) (construing statute in way to avoid the constitutional issue raised
in Yakus). In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987), the Court held
that, when judicial review of a deportation order had been precluded, due process
required that the alien be allowed to make a collateral challenge to the use of that
proceeding as an element of a subsequent criminal proceeding.
