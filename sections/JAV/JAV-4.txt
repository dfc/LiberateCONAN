states and a $750 fee for the privilege of manufacturing beer,2 and
a Minnesota statute that prohibited a licensed manufacturer or whole-
saler from importing any brand of intoxicating liquor containing more
than 25 percent alcohol by volume and ready for sale without fur-
ther processing, unless such brand was registered in the United States
Patent Office.3 Also validated were retaliation laws prohibiting sale
of beer from states that discriminated against sale of beer from the
enacting state.4
    Conceding, in State Board of Equalization v. Young’s Market Co.,5
that, “[p]rior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have
been unconstitutional to have imposed any fee for [the privilege of
importation] . . . even if the State had exacted an equal fee for the
privilege of transporting domestic beer from its place of manufac-
ture to the [seller’s] place of business,” the Court proclaimed that
this Amendment “abrogated the right to import free, so far as con-
cerns intoxicating liquors.” Because the Amendment was viewed as
conferring on states an unconditioned authority to prohibit totally
the importation of intoxicating beverages, it followed that any dis-
criminatory restriction falling short of total exclusion was equally
valid, notwithstanding the absence of any connection between such
restriction and public health, safety, or morals. As to the conten-
tion that the unequal treatment of imported beer would contravene
the Equal Protection Clause, the Court succinctly observed that “[a]
classification recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be
deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth.” 6
    In Seagram & Sons v. Hostetter 7 the Court upheld a state stat-
ute regulating the price of intoxicating liquors, asserting that the
Twenty-first Amendment bestowed upon the states broad regula-
tory power over the liquor sales within their territories.8 The Court
also noted that states are not totally bound by traditional Com-
merce Clause limitations when they restrict the importation of in-
toxicants destined for use, distribution, or consumption within their

restated these conclusions. The contention that discriminatory regulation of im-
