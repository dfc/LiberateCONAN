bars. “Pursuant to its power to regulate the sale of liquor within
its boundaries, it has banned topless dancing in establishments granted
a license to serve liquor. The State’s power to ban the sale of alco-
holic beverages entirely includes the lesser power to ban the sale
of liquor on premises where topless dancing occurs.” 35 This recur-
rence to the greater-includes-the-lesser-power argument, relatively
rare in recent years,36 would if it were broadly applied give the states
in the area of regulation of alcoholic beverages a review-free discre-
tion of unknown scope.
     In 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island,37 the Court disavowed
LaRue and Bellanca, and reaffirmed that, “although the Twenty-
first Amendment limits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause
on a state’s regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicat-
ing beverages within its borders, ‘the Amendment does not license
the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the
Constitution,’ ” 38 and therefore does not afford a basis for state leg-
islation infringing freedom of expression protected by the First Amend-
ment. There is no reason, the Court asserted, for distinguishing be-
tween freedom of expression and the other constitutional guarantees
(e.g., those protected by the Establishment and Equal Protection
Clauses) held to be insulated from state impairment pursuant to
powers conferred by the Twenty-first Amendment. The Court has-
tened to add by way of dictum that states retain adequate police
powers to regulate “grossly sexual exhibitions in premises licensed
to serve alcoholic beverages.” “Entirely apart from the Twenty-first
Amendment, the State has ample power to prohibit the sale of alco-
holic beverages in inappropriate locations.” 39

Effect on Federal Regulation
    The Twenty-first Amendment does not oust all federal regula-
tory power affecting transportation or sale of alcoholic beverages.
    35  New York State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714, 717 (1981).
    36  For a rejection of the argument in another context, contemporaneously with
Bellanca, see Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 451
U.S. 648, 657–68 (1981). For use of the argument in the commercial speech context,
see Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328,
345–46 (1986); this use of the argument in Posadas was disavowed in 44 Liquormart,
Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996). See also Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,
467 U.S. 691 (1984), not addressing the commercial speech issue but holding state
regulation of liquor advertisements on cable TV to be preempted, in spite of the Twenty-
first Amendment, by federal policies promoting access to cable TV).
     37 517 U.S. 484 (1996) (statutory prohibition against advertisements that pro-

vide the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages
is not shielded from constitutional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment).
     38 517 U.S. at 516 (quoting Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 712

(1984)).
     39 517 U.S. at 515.
