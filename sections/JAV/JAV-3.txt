                  REPEAL OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT

       Effect of Repeal
           The operative effect of section 1, repealing the Eighteenth Amend-
       ment, is considered in the commentary dealing with that Amend-
       ment.

       Scope of Regulatory Power Conferred upon the States
           Discrimination Between Domestic and Imported Prod-
       ucts.—In a series of decisions rendered shortly after ratification of
       the Twenty-first Amendment, the Court established the proposition
       that states are competent to adopt legislation discriminating against
       imported intoxicating liquors in favor of those of domestic origin
       and that such discrimination offends neither the Commerce Clause
       of Article I nor the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of
       the Fourteenth Amendment. Modern cases, however, have recog-
       nized that “state regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimi-
       nation principle of the Commerce Clause.” 1
           Initially, the Court upheld a California statute that exacted a
       $500 annual license fee for the privilege of importing beer from other
          1   Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 487 (2005).
