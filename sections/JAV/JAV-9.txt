the sale or use of liquor is concerned.’ ” 28 The holding on this point
is “that the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment does not al-
ter the application of the equal protection standards that would oth-
erwise govern this case.” 29 Other decisions reach the same result
but without discussing the application of the Amendment.30 Simi-
larly, a state “may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first
Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment.” 31
     The Court departed from this line of reasoning in California v.
LaRue,32 in which it sustained the facial constitutionality of regula-
tions barring a lengthy list of actual or simulated sexual activities
and motion picture portrayals of these activities in establishments
licensed to sell liquor by the drink. In an action attacking the valid-
ity of the regulations as applied to ban nude dancing in bars, the
Court considered at some length the material adduced at the pub-
lic hearings which resulted in the rules demonstrating the anti-
social consequences of the activities in the bars. It conceded that
the regulations reached expression that would not be deemed le-
gally obscene under prevailing standards and reached expressive con-
duct that would not be prohibitable under prevailing standards,33
but the Court thought that the constitutional protection of conduct
that partakes “more of gross sexuality than of communication” was
outweighed by the state’s interest in maintaining order and de-
cency. Moreover, the Court continued, the second section of the Twenty-
first Amendment gave an “added presumption in favor of the valid-
ity” of the regulations as applied to prohibit questioned activities
in places serving liquor by the drink.34
     A much broader ruling resulted when the Court considered the
constitutionality of a state regulation banning topless dancing in
    28   429 U.S. at 206 (quoting P. BREST, PROCESSES   OF   CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONMAKING—
CASES AND MATERIALS 258 (1975).
    29 429 U.S. at 209–210.
     30 E.g., Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 178–97 (1972) (invalidating

a state liquor regulation as an equal protection denial in a racial context); Wiscon-
sin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971) (invalidating a state law authorizing the
posting of someone as an “excessive drinker” and thus barring him from buying li-
quor, as reconstrued in Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 707–09 (1976)).
     31 Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, 459 U.S. 116, 122 n.5 (1982).
     32 409 U.S. 109 (1972).
     33 Cf. Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981) (ban on live nude

dancing in Borough); Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922 (1975) (ban on nude dancing
in “any public place” applied to topless dancing in bars).
     34 409 U.S. at 114–19. In Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 932–33 (1975), the

Court described its holding in LaRue more broadly, saying that “we concluded that
the broad powers of the States to regulate the sale of liquor, conferred by the Twenty-
first Amendment, outweighed any First Amendment interest in nude dancing and
that a State could therefore ban such dancing as part of its liquor license control
program.”
