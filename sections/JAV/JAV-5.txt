borders.9 In such a situation the Twenty-first Amendment de-
mands wide latitude for regulation by the state.10 The Court added
that there was nothing in the Twenty-first Amendment or any other
part of the Constitution that required state laws regulating the li-
quor business to be motivated exclusively by a desire to promote
temperance.11
    More recent cases undercut the expansive interpretation of state
powers in Young’s Market and the other early cases. The first step
was to harmonize Twenty-first Amendment and Commerce Clause
principles where possible by asking “whether the interests impli-
cated by a state regulation are so closely related to the powers re-
served by the Twenty-first Amendment that the regulation may pre-
vail, notwithstanding that its requirements directly conflict with
express federal policies.” 12 Because “[t]he central purpose of the
[Amendment] was not to empower States to favor local liquor indus-
tries by erecting barriers to competition,” the “central tenet” of the
Commerce Clause will control to invalidate “mere economic protec-
tionism,” at least where the state cannot justify its tax or regula-
tion as “designed to promote temperance or to carry out any other
purpose of the . . . Amendment.” 13 But the Court eventually came
to view the Twenty-first Amendment as not creating an exception
to the commerce power. “[S]tate regulation of alcohol is limited by
the nondiscrimination principle of the Commerce Clause,” the Court
stated in 2005. Discrimination in favor of local products can be up-
held only if the state “advances a legitimate local purpose that can-
not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alterna-

mode of liquor regulation chosen by a state in such circumstances could ever consti-
tute so grave an interference with a company’s operations elsewhere as to make the
regulation invalid under the Commerce Clause. Id. at 42–43.
