from terminating the business of an airport dealer who, under sanc-
tion of federal customs laws, acquired “tax-free liquors for export”
from out-of-state sources for resale exclusively to airline passen-
gers, with delivery deferred until the latter arrive at foreign desti-
nations.24 Similarly, a state “affirmation law” prohibiting wholesal-
ers from charging lower prices on out-of-state sales than those already
approved for in-state sales is invalid as a direct regulation of inter-
state commerce. “The Commerce Clause operates with full force when-
ever one State attempts to regulate the transportation and sale of
alcoholic beverages destined for distribution and consumption in a
foreign country . . . or another State.” 25
     Effect of Section 2 upon Other Constitutional Provisions.—
Notwithstanding the 1936 assertion that “[a] classification recog-
nized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden
by the Fourteenth,” 26 the Court has now in a series of cases acknowl-
edged that § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment did not repeal provi-
sions of the Constitution adopted before ratification of the Twenty-
first, save for the severe cabining of Commerce Clause application
to the liquor traffic, but it has formulated no consistent rationale
for a determination of the effect of the later provision upon earlier
ones. In Craig v. Boren,27 the Court invalidated a state law that
prescribed different minimum drinking ages for men and women
as violating the Equal Protection Clause. To the state’s Twenty-
first Amendment argument, the Court replied that the Amendment
“primarily created an exception to the normal operation of the Com-
merce Clause” and that its “relevance . . . to other constitutional
provisions” is doubtful. “ ‘Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-
first Amendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights pro-
tected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment where

Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 206–07 (1976), this case and others like it are distin-
guished as involving the importation of intoxicants into a state, an area of in-
creased state regulatory power, and as involving purely economic regulation tradi-
tionally meriting only restrained review. Neither distinguishing element, of course,
addresses the precise language quoted. For consideration of equal protection analy-
sis in an analogous situation, the statutory exemption of state insurance regula-
tions from Commerce Clause purview, see Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State
