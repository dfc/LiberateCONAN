tives.” 14 This interpretation stemmed from the Court’s conclusion
that the Twenty-first Amendment restored to states the powers that
they had possessed prior to Prohibition “to maintain an effective
and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transpor-
tation, importation, and use” in a manner that did not discrimi-
nate against out-of-state goods.15
     Regulation of Transportation and “Through” Shipments.—
When passing upon the constitutionality of legislation regulating
the carriage of liquor interstate, a majority of the Justices seemed
disposed to bypass the Twenty-first Amendment and to resolve the
issue exclusively in terms of the Commerce Clause and state power.
This trend toward devaluation of the Twenty-first Amendment was
set in motion by Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves 16 in which a Kentucky stat-
ute that prohibited the transportation of intoxicating liquors by car-
riers other than licensed common carriers was enforced as to an
Indiana corporation, engaged in delivering liquor obtained from Ken-
tucky distillers to consignees in Illinois but licensed only as a con-
tract carrier under the Federal Motor Carriers Act. After acknowl-
edging that “the Twenty-first Amendment sanctions the right of a
State to legislate concerning intoxicating liquors brought from with-
out, unfettered by the Commerce Clause,” 17 the Court proceeded to
found its ruling largely upon decisions antedating the Amendment
that sustained similar state regulations as a legitimate exercise of
the police power not unduly burdening interstate commerce. In light
of the contemporaneous cases enumerated in the preceding topic con-
struing the Twenty-first Amendment as according a plenary power
to the states, such extended emphasis on the police power and the
Commerce Clause would seem to have been unnecessary. Thereaf-
ter, a total eclipse of the Twenty-first Amendment was recorded in
Duckworth v. Arkansas 18 and Carter v. Virginia,19 in which, with-

     14 Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 487, 489 (2005) (invalidating Michigan and

New York laws allowing in-state but not out-of-state wineries to make direct sales
to consumers). This is the same test the Court applies outside the context of alco-
holic beverages. See Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138 (1986) (once discrimination
against interstate commerce is established, “the burden falls on the State to demon-
strate both that the statute ‘serves a legitimate local purpose,’ and that this pur-
pose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means”) (quoting
Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)).
     15 460 U.S. at 484. According to Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court, these

pre-Prohibition state powers were framed by the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts, and
the Twenty-first Amendment evidenced a “clear intention of constitutionalizing the
Commerce Clause framework established under those statutes.” Id.
