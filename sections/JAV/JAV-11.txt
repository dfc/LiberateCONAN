Thus, the Court held, the Amendment does not bar a prosecution
under the Sherman Antitrust Act of producers, wholesalers, and re-
tailers charged with conspiring to fix and maintain retail prices of
alcoholic beverages in Colorado.40 In a concurring opinion, sup-
ported by Justice Roberts, Justice Frankfurter took the position that
if the State of Colorado had in fact “authorized the transactions here
complained of, the Sherman Law could not override such exercise
of state power. . . . [Because] the Sherman Law . . . can have no
greater potency than the Commerce Clause itself, it must equally
yield to state power drawn from the Twenty-first Amendment.” 41
     Following a review of the cases in this area, the Court has ob-
served “that there is no bright line between federal and state pow-
ers over liquor. The Twenty-first Amendment grants the States vir-
tually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale
of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system. Al-
though States retain substantial discretion to establish other li-
quor regulations, those controls may be subject to the federal com-
merce power in appropriate situations. The competing state and federal
interests can be reconciled only after careful scrutiny of those con-
cerns in a ‘concrete case.’ ” 42 Invalidating under the Sherman Act a
state fair trade scheme imposing a resale price maintenance policy
for wine, the Court balanced the federal interest in free enterprise
expressed through the antitrust laws against the asserted state in-
terests in promoting temperance and orderly marketing conditions.
Because the state courts had found that the policy under attack pro-
moted neither interest significantly, the Supreme Court experi-
enced no difficulty in concluding that the federal interest prevailed.
Whether more substantial state interests or means more suited to
promoting the state interests would survive attack under federal
legislation must await further litigation.
     Congress may condition receipt of federal highway funds on a
state’s agreeing to raise the minimum drinking age to 21, the Twenty-
first Amendment not constituting an “independent constitutional bar”
to this sort of spending power exercise even though Congress may
lack the power to achieve its purpose directly.43
