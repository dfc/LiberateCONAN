             POPULAR ELECTION OF SENATORS


                  SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT
    The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two
Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six
years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each
State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the
most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
    When vacancies happen in the representation of any State
in the Senate, the executive authority of each State shall issue
writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided That the legis-

temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by
election as the legislature may direct.
    This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the
election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid
as part of the Constitution.
