ers participating in primary elections to designate their preference
for one of several party candidates for a senatorial seat, and nomi-
nations unofficially effected thereby were transmitted to the legisla-
ture. Although their action rested upon no stronger foundation than
common understanding, the legislatures generally elected the win-
ning candidate of the majority, and, indeed, in two states, candi-
dates for legislative seats were required to promise to support, with-
out regard to party ties, the senatorial candidate polling the most
votes. As a result of such developments, at least 29 states by 1912,
one year before ratification, were nominating Senators on a popu-
lar basis, and, as a consequence, the constitutional discretion of the
legislatures had been reduced to little more than that retained by
presidential electors.1
     Very shortly after ratification it was established that, if a per-
son possessed the qualifications requisite for voting for a Senator,
his right to vote for the Senator was not derived merely from the
constitution and laws of the state that chose the Senator, but had
its foundation in the Constitution of the United States.2 Consistent
with this view, federal courts declared that, when local party au-
thorities, acting pursuant to regulations prescribed by a party’s state
executive committee, refused to permit an African-American, on ac-
count of his race, to vote in a primary to select candidates for the
office of U.S. Senator, they deprived him of a right secured to him
by the Constitution and laws, in violation of this Amendment.3 An
Illinois statute, by contrast, that required that a petition to form,
and to nominate candidates for, a new political party be signed by
at least 25,000 voters from at least 50 counties was held not to im-
pair any right under the Seventeenth Amendment, notwithstand-
ing that 52 percent of the state’s voters were residents of one county,
87 percent were residents of 49 counties, and only 13 percent re-
sided in the 53 least populous counties.4

an additional qualification to voting in violation of the Seventeenth Amendment and
