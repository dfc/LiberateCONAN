                           AUTHORIZATION
  PUBLIC LAW 91–589, 84 STAT. 1585, 2 U.S.C. § 168
JOINT RESOLUTION Authorizing the preparation and printing of a revised
   edition of the Constitution of the United States of America—Analysis and
   Interpretation, of decennial revised editions thereof, and of biennial cu-
   mulative supplements to such revised editions.
Whereas the Constitution of the United States of America—
     Analysis and Interpretation, published in 1964 as Senate Docu-
     ment Numbered 39, Eighty-eighth Congress, serves a very
     useful purpose by supplying essential information, not only
     to the Members of Congress but also to the public at large;
Whereas such document contains annotations of cases decided
     by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 22, 1964;
Whereas many cases bearing significantly upon the analysis and
     interpretation of the Constitution have been decided by the
     Supreme Court since June 22, 1964;
Whereas the Congress, in recognition of the usefulness of this
     type of document, has in the last half century since 1913,
     ordered the preparation and printing of revised editions of
     such a document on six occasions at intervals of from ten
     to fourteen years; and
Whereas the continuing usefulness and importance of such a docu-
     ment will be greatly enhanced by revision at shorter inter-
     vals on a regular schedule and thus made more readily avail-
     able to Members and Committees by means of pocket-part
     supplements: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
     States of America in Congress assembled, That the Librar-
     ian of Congress shall have prepared—
(1) a hardbound revised edition of the Constitution of the United
     States of America—Analysis and Interpretation, published
     as Senate Document Numbered 39, Eighty-eighth Congress
     (referred to hereinafter as the “Constitution Annotated”), which
     shall contain annotations of decisions of the Supreme Court
     of the United States through the end of the October 1971
     term of the Supreme Court, construing provisions of the Con-
     stitution;
(2) upon the completion of each of the October 1973, October
     1975, October 1977, and October 1979 terms of the Su-
