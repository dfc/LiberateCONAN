     The Convention Alternative.—Because it has never success-
fully been invoked, the convention method of amendment is sur-
rounded by a lengthy list of questions.21 When and how is a conven-
tion to be convened? Must the applications of the requisite number
of states be identical or ask for substantially the same amendment,
or merely deal with the same subject matter? Must the requisite
number of petitions be contemporaneous with each other, substan-
tially contemporaneous, or strung out over several years? Could a
convention be limited to consideration of the amendment or the sub-
ject matter which it is called to consider? These are only a few of
the obvious questions, and others lurk to be revealed on deeper con-
sideration.22 This method has been close to being used several times.
Only one state was lacking when the Senate finally permitted pas-
sage of an amendment providing for the direct election of sena-
tors.23 Two states were lacking in a petition drive for a constitu-
tional limitation on income tax rates.24 The drive for an amendment
to limit the Supreme Court’s legislative apportionment decisions came
within one state of the required number, and a proposal for a bal-
anced budget amendment has been but two states short of the req-
uisite number for some time.25 Arguments existed in each instance
against counting all the petitions, but the political realities no doubt
are that if there is an authentic national movement underlying a
petitioning by two-thirds of the states there will be a response by
Congress.
    Ratification.—In 1992, the nation apparently ratified a long-
quiescent 27th Amendment, to the surprise of just about everyone.
Whether the new Amendment has any effect in the area of its sub-

Hollingsworth v. Virginia was Rightly Decided, and Why INS v. Chadha was Wrongly
Reasoned, 83 TEX. L. REV. 1265 (2005), for extensive analysis of what Hollingsworth’s
delphic pronouncement could mean. Whatever the Court decided in Hollingsworth,
it has since treated the issue as settled. See Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U.S. 221,
229 (1920) (in Hollingsworth, “this court settled that the submission of a constitu-
tional amendment did not require the action of the President”); INS v. Chadha, 462
U.S. 919, 955 n.21 (1983) (in Hollingsworth, “the Court held Presidential approval
was unnecessary for a proposed constitutional amendment . . . ”).

a Federal Constitutional Convention, 85th Congress, 1st Sess. (Comm. Print; House
Judiciary Committee) (1957). A thorough and critical study of activity under the pe-
tition method can be found in R. CAPLAN, CONSTITUTIONAL BRINKMANSHIP: AMENDING THE
