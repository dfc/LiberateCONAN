within some reasonable time after the proposal.” 59 Three reasons
underlay the Court’s finding of this implication and they are sug-
gestive on the question of rescission.60
    Although addressing a different issue, the Court’s discussion of
the length of time an amendment may reasonably pend before los-
ing its viability is suggestive with respect to rescission. That is, first,
with proposal and ratification as successive steps in a single en-
deavor, second, with the necessity of amendment forming the basis
for adoption of the proposal, and, third, especially with the implica-
tion that an amendment’s adoption should be “sufficiently contem-
poraneous” in the requisite number of states “to reflect the will of
the people in all sections at relatively the same period,” it would
raise a large question were the ratification process to count one or
more states that were acting to withdraw their expression of judg-
ment that amendment was necessary at the same time other states
were acting affirmatively. The “decisive expression of the people’s
will” that is to bind all might well be found lacking in those or simi-
lar circumstances. But employment of this analysis would not nec-
essarily lead in specific circumstances to failures of ratification; the
particular facts surrounding the passage of rescission resolutions,
for example, might lead Congress to conclude that the requisite “con-
temporaneous” “expression of the people’s will” was not under-
mined by the action.
     And employment of this analysis would still seem, under these
precedents, to leave to Congress the crucial determination of the
success or failure of ratification. At the same time it was positing
this analysis in the context of passing on the question of Con-
gress’s power to fix a time limit, the Court in Dillon v. Gloss ob-
served that Article V left to Congress the authority “to deal with
subsidiary matters of detail as the public interest and changing con-
ditions may require.” 61 And, in Coleman v. Miller, Chief Justice Hughes
went further in respect to these “matters of detail” being “within
the congressional province” in the resolution of which the decision
by Congress “would not be subject to review by the courts.” 62

power for itself to pass on the congressional decision, saying “[o]f the power of Con-
gress, keeping within reasonable limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification
we entertain no doubt” and noting later than no question existed that the seven-
year period was reasonable. Id.
