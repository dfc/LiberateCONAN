several states was conclusive upon the courts,73 it had treated these
questions as justiciable, although it had uniformly rejected them
on the merits. In that year, however, the whole subject was thrown
into confusion by the inconclusive decision in Coleman v. Miller.74
This case came up on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of
Kansas to review the denial of a writ of mandamus to compel the
Secretary of the Kansas Senate to erase an endorsement on a reso-
lution ratifying the proposed child labor amendment to the Consti-
tution to the effect that it had been adopted by the Kansas Senate.
The attempted ratification was assailed on three grounds: (1) that
the amendment had been previously rejected by the state legisla-
ture; (2) that it was no longer open to ratification because an unrea-
sonable period of time, thirteen years, had elapsed since its submis-
sion to the states, and (3) that the lieutenant governor had no right
to cast the deciding vote in the Kansas Senate in favor of ratifica-
tion.
    Four opinions were written in the Supreme Court, no one of
which commanded the support of more than four members of the
Court. The majority ruled that the plaintiffs, members of the Kan-
sas State Senate, had a sufficient interest in the controversy to give
the federal courts jurisdiction to review the case. Without agree-
ment on the grounds for their decision, a different majority af-
firmed the judgment of the Kansas court denying the relief sought.
Four members who concurred in the result had voted to dismiss
the writ on the ground that the amending process “is ‘political’ in
its entirety, from submission until an amendment becomes part of
the Constitution, and is not subject to judicial guidance, control or
interference at any point.” 75 In an opinion reported as “the opinion
of the Court,” but in which it appears that only two Justices joined
Chief Justice Hughes who wrote it, it was declared that the writ of
mandamus was properly denied, because the question whether a
reasonable time had elapsed since submission of the proposal was
a nonjusticiable political question, the kinds of considerations enter-
    73  Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130 (1922).
    74  307 U.S. 433 (1939). Cf. Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U.S. 126 (1922), in which
the Court held that a private citizen could not sue in the federal courts to secure an
indirect determination of the validity of a constitutional amendment about to be ad-
opted.
     75 Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 456, 459 (1939) (Justices Black, Roberts, Frank-

furter, and Douglas concurring). Because the four believed that the parties lacked
standing to bring the action, id. at 456, 460 (Justice Frankfurter dissenting on this
point, joined by the other three Justices), the further discussion of the applicability
of the political question doctrine is, strictly speaking, dicta. Justice Stevens, then a
circuit judge, also felt free to disregard the opinion because a majority of the Court
in Coleman “refused to accept that position.” Dyer v. Blair, 390 F. Supp. 1291, 1299–
1300 (N.D.Ill. 1975) (three-judge court). See also Idaho v. Freeman, 529 F. Supp.
1107, 1125–26 (D. Idaho, 1981), vacated and remanded to dismiss, 459 U.S. 809 (1982).
