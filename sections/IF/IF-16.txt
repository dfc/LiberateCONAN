     Thus, it may be that, if the Dillon v. Gloss construction is found
persuasive, Congress would have constitutional standards to guide
its decision on the validity of rescission. At the same time, if these
precedents reviewed above are adhered to and strictly applied, it
appears that the congressional determination to permit or to disal-
low rescission would not be subject to judicial review.
     Adoption of the alternative view, that Congress has no role but
that the appropriate executive official has the sole responsibility, would
entail different consequences. That official, now the Archivist, ap-
pears to have no discretion but to certify once he receives state no-
tification.63 The official could, of course, request a Department of
Justice legal opinion on some issue, such as the validity of rescis-
sions. That is the course advocated by the executive branch, natu-
rally, but it is one a little difficult to square with the ministerial
responsibility of the Archivist.64 In any event, there would seem to
be no support for a political question preclusion of judicial review
under these circumstances. Whether the Archivist certifies on the
mere receipt of a ratification resolution or does so only after ascer-
taining the resolution’s validity, it would appear that it is action
subject to judicial review.65
     Congress has complete freedom of choice between the two meth-
ods of ratification recognized by Article V: by the legislatures of the
states or by conventions in the states. In United States v. Sprague,66
counsel advanced the contention that the Tenth Amendment recog-
nized a distinction between powers reserved to the states and pow-
ers reserved to the people, and that state legislatures were compe-
tent to delegate only the former to the National Government;
rence thought the Court “treated the amending process of the Constitution in some
respects as subject to judicial review, in others as subject to the final authority of
Congress” and urged that the Dillon v. Gloss “reasonable time” construction be dis-
approved. Id. at 456, 458.

REC. 3250 (Message from President Truman accompanying Reorg. Plan No. 20 of
1950); 16 Ops. of the Office of Legal Coun. 102, 117 (1992) (prelim. pr.).
     64 16 Ops. of the Office of Legal Coun. at 116–118. Thus, OLC says that the

statute “clearly requires that, before performing this ministerial function, the Archi-
vist must determine whether he has received ‘official notice’ that an amendment has
been adopted ‘according to the provisions of the Constitution.’ This is the question
of law that the Archivist may properly submit to the Attorney General for resolu-
tion.” Id. at 118. But if his duty is “ministerial,” it seems, the Archivist may only
notice the fact of receipt of a state resolution; if he may, in consultation with the
Attorney General, determine whether the resolution is valid, that is considerably
more than a “ministerial” function.
     65 No doubt under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706, al-

though there may well be questions about one possible exception—the “committed
to agency discretion” provision. Id. at § 701(a)(2).
