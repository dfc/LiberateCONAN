delegation of the latter required action of the people through con-
ventions in the several states. The Eighteenth Amendment being
of the latter character, the ratification by state legislatures, so the
argument ran, was invalid. The Supreme Court rejected the argu-
ment. It found the language of Article V too clear to admit of read-
ing any exception into it by implication.
    The term “legislatures” as used in Article V means delibera-
tive, representative bodies of the type which in 1789 exercised the
legislative power in the several states. It does not comprehend the
popular referendum, which has subsequently become a part of the
legislative process in many of the states. A state may not validly
condition ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment on its
approval by such a referendum.67 In the words of the Court: “[T]he
function of a state legislature in ratifying a proposed amendment
to the Federal Constitution, like the function of Congress in propos-
ing the amendment, is a federal function derived from the Federal
Constitution; and it transcends any limitations sought to be im-
posed by the people of a State.” 68
    Authentication and Proclamation.—Formerly, official notice
from a state legislature, duly authenticated, that it had ratified a
proposed amendment went to the Secretary of State, upon whom it
was binding, “being certified by his proclamation, [was] conclusive
upon the courts” as against any objection which might be subse-
quently raised as to the regularity of the legislative procedure by
which ratification was brought about.69 This function of the Secre-
tary was first transferred to a functionary called the Administrator
of General Services,70 and then to the Archivist of the United States.71
In Dillon v. Gloss,72 the Supreme Court held that the Eighteenth
Amendment became operative on the date of ratification by the thirty-
sixth state, rather than on the later date of the proclamation is-
sued by the Secretary of State, and doubtless the same rule holds
as to a similar proclamation by the Archivist.

Judicial Review Under Article V
   Prior to 1939, the Supreme Court had taken cognizance of a
number of diverse objections to the validity of specific amend-
ments. Apart from holding that official notice of ratification by the
