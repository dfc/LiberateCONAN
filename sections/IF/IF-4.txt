basis that the amending process could not be used to work such a
major change in the internal affairs of the states, but the protest
was in vain.4 Many years later the validity of both the Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Amendments was challenged because of their con-
tent. The arguments against the former took a wide range. Coun-
sel urged that the power of amendment is limited to the correction
of errors in the framing of the Constitution and that it does not
comprehend the adoption of additional or supplementary provi-
sions. They contended further that ordinary legislation cannot be
embodied in a constitutional amendment and that Congress cannot
constitutionally propose any amendment that involves the exercise
or relinquishment of the sovereign powers of a state.5 The Nine-
teenth Amendment was attacked on the narrower ground that a state
that had not ratified the amendment would be deprived of its equal
suffrage in the Senate because its representatives in that body would
be persons not of its choosing, i.e., persons chosen by voters whom
the state itself had not authorized to vote for Senators.6 Brushing
aside these arguments as unworthy of serious attention, the Su-
preme Court held both amendments valid.

Proposing a Constitutional Amendment
    Thirty-three proposed amendments to the Constitution have been
submitted to the states pursuant to this Article, all of them upon
the vote of the requisite majorities in Congress and none by the
alternative convention method.7 In the Convention, much contro-
versy surrounded the issue of the process by which the document
then being drawn should be amended. At first, it was voted that
“provision ought to be made for the amendment [of the Constitu-
tion] whensoever it shall seem necessary” without the agency of Con-
gress being at all involved.8 Acting upon this instruction, the Com-
mittee on Detail submitted a section providing that upon the
application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states Congress
was to call a convention for purpose of amending the Constitution.9
Adopted,10 the section was soon reconsidered on the motion of Fram-
ers of quite different points of view. Some worried that the provi-
sion would allow two-thirds of the states to subvert the others,11
