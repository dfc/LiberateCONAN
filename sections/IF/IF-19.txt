ing into deciding being fit for Congress to evaluate, and the ques-
tion of the effect of a previous rejection upon a ratification was simi-
larly nonjusticiable, because the 1868 Fourteenth Amendment
precedent of congressional determination “has been accepted.” 76 But
with respect to the contention that the lieutenant governor should
not have been permitted to cast the deciding vote in favor of ratifi-
cation, the Court found itself evenly divided, thus accepting the judg-
ment of the Kansas Supreme Court that the state officer had acted
validly.77 However, the unexplained decision by Chief Justice Hughes
and his two concurring Justices that the issue of the lieutenant gov-
ernor’s vote was justiciable indicates at the least that their posi-
tion was in disagreement with the view of the other four Justices
in the majority that all questions surrounding constitutional amend-
ments are nonjusticiable.78
    However, Coleman does stand as authority for the proposition
that at least some decisions with respect to the proposal and ratifi-
cation of constitutional amendments are exclusively within the pur-
view of Congress, either because they are textually committed to
Congress or because the courts lack adequate criteria of determina-
tion to pass on them.79 But to what extent the political question

by Justices Stone and Reed).
     77 Justices Black, Roberts, Frankfurter, and Douglas thought this issue was

nonjusticiable too. 307 U.S. at 456. Although all nine Justices joined the rest of the
decision, see id. at 470, 474 (Justice Butler, joined by Justice McReynolds, dissent-
ing), one Justice did not participate in deciding the issue of the lieutenant gover-
nor’s participation; apparently, Justice McReynolds was the absent Member. Note,
28 Geo. L. J. 199, 200 n.7 (1940). Thus, Chief Justice Hughes and Justices Stone,
Reed, and Butler would have been the four finding the issue justiciable.
     78 The strongest argument to the effect that constitutional amendment ques-

tions are justiciable is Rees, Throwing Away the Key: The Unconstitutionality of the
Equal Rights Amendment Extension, 58 TEX. L. REV. 875, 886–901 (1980), and his
student note, Comment, Rescinding Ratification of Proposed Constitutional Amend-
ments: A Question for the Court, 37 LA. L. REV. 896 (1977). Two perspicacious schol-
ars of the Constitution have come to opposite conclusions on the issue. Compare Del-
linger, The Legitimacy of Constitutional Change: Rethinking the Amendment Process,
97 HARV. L. REV. 386, 414–416 (1983) (there is judicial review), with Tribe, A Consti-
tution We Are Amending: In Defense of a Restrained Judicial Role, 97 HARV. L. REV.
433, 435–436 (1983). Much of the scholarly argument, up to that time, is collected
in the ERA-time-extension hearings. Supra. The only recent judicial precedents di-
rectly on point found justiciability on at least some questions. Dyer v. Blair, 390 F.
Supp. 1291 (N.D.Ill., 1975) (three-judge court); Idaho v. Freeman, 529 F. Supp. 1107
(D. Idaho, 1981), vacated and remanded to dismiss, 459 U.S. 809 (1982).
     79 In Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 214 (1962), the Court, in explaining the politi-

cal question doctrine and categorizing cases, observed that Coleman “held that the
questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained
open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratifica-
tion, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision
that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.” Both characteristics were features that
the Court in Baker, 369 U.S. at 217, identified as elements of political questions,
