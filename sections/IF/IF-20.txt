doctrine encompasses the amendment process and what the stan-
dards may be to resolve that particular issue remain elusive.




e.g., “a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordi-
nate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable stan-
dards or resolving it.” Later formulations have adhered to this way of expressing
the matter. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969); O’Brien v. Brown, 409 U.S. 1
(1972); Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1 (1973). However, it could be argued that, what-
ever the Court may say, what it did, particularly in Powell but also in Baker, largely
drains the political question doctrine of its force. See Uhler v. AFL–CIO, 468 U.S.
1310 (1984) (Justice Rehnquist on Circuit) (doubting Coleman’s vitality in amend-
ment context). But see Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996, 1002 (1979) (opinion of
Justices Rehnquist, Stewart, Stevens, and Chief Justice Burger) (relying heavily upon
Coleman to find an issue of treaty termination nonjusticiable). Compare id. at 1001
(Justice Powell concurring) (viewing Coleman as limited to its context).
