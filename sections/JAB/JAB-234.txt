defendants, and a majority of Justices agreed on that point.1227 In
Philadelphia Newspapers, however, the Court expressly reserved the
issue of “what standards would apply if the plaintiff sues a nonmedia
defendant.” 1228
    Other issues besides who is covered by the Times privilege are
of considerable importance. The use of the expression “actual mal-
ice” has been confusing in many respects, because it is in fact a
concept distinct from the common law meaning of malice or the mean-
ings common understanding might give to it.1229 Constitutional “ac-
tual malice” means that the defamation was published with knowl-
edge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was
false.1230 Reckless disregard is not simply negligent behavior, but
publication with serious doubts as to the truth of what is ut-
tered.1231 A defamation plaintiff under the Times or Gertz standard
has the burden of proving by “clear and convincing” evidence, not
merely by the preponderance of evidence standard ordinarily borne
in civil cases, that the defendant acted with knowledge of falsity or
with reckless disregard.1232 Moreover, the Court has held, a Gertz
plaintiff has the burden of proving the actual falsity of the defama-
tory publication.1233 A plaintiff suing the press 1234 for defamation
under the Times or Gertz standards is not limited to attempting to
prove his case without resort to discovery of the defendant’s edito-

pressing his view that such a distinction is untenable. Id. at 780.

Corp. v. Hanks, 389 U.S. 81 (1967). A finding of “highly unreasonable conduct consti-
tuting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordi-
narily adhered to by responsible publishers” is alone insufficient to establish actual
malice. Harte-Hanks Communications v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657 (1989) (none-
theless upholding the lower court’s finding of actual malice based on the “entire re-
cord”).

pers Corp. v. Hanks, 389 U.S. 81, 83 (1967). See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 285–86 (1964) (“convincing clarity”). A corollary is that the issue on
motion for summary judgment in a New York Times case is whether the evidence is
such that a reasonable jury might find that actual malice has been shown with con-
vincing clarity. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242 (1986).
    1233 Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767 (1986) (leaving open the

issue of what “quantity” or standard of proof must be met).
    1234 Because the defendants in these cases have typically been media defen-

dants (but see Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64 (1964); Henry v. Collins, 380 U.S.
356 (1965)), and because of the language in the Court’s opinions, some have argued
