    In Miller v. California,1306 the Court prescribed standards by
which unprotected pornographic materials were to be identified. Be-
cause of the inherent dangers in undertaking to regulate any form
of expression, laws to regulate pornography must be carefully lim-
ited; their scope is to be confined to materials that “depict or de-
scribe patently offensive ‘hard core’ sexual conduct specifically de-
fined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.” 1307 The
law “must also be limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal
to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have
serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” 1308 The stan-
dard that a work must be “utterly without redeeming social value”
before it may be suppressed was disavowed and discarded. In deter-
mining whether material appeals to a prurient interest or is pa-
tently offensive, the trier of fact, whether a judge or a jury, is not
bound by a hypothetical national standard but may apply the local
community standard where the trier of fact sits.1309 Prurient inter-
est and patent offensiveness, the Court indicated, “are essentially
questions of fact.” 1310 By contrast, the third or “value” prong of the

allegedly ‘obscene’ contents.” Id. at 113. Justices Stewart and Marshall joined this
opinion; Justice Douglas dissented separately, adhering to the view that the First
Amendment absolutely protected all expression. Id. at 70.

     1307 Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 27 (1973). The Court stands ready to read

into federal statutes the standards it has formulated. United States v. 12 200–Ft.
Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123, 130 n.7 (1973) (Court is prepared to construe statutes
proscribing materials that are “obscene,” “lewd,” “lascivious,” “filthy,” “indecent,” and
“immoral” as limited to the types of “hard core” pornography reachable under the
Miller standards). For other cases applying Miller standards to federal statutes, see
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 110–16 (1974) (use of the mails); United States
v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139 (1973) (transportation of pornography in interstate com-
merce). The Court’s insistence on specificity in state statutes, either as written by
the legislature or as authoritatively construed by the state court, appears to have
been significantly weakened, in fact if not in enunciation, in Ward v. Illinois, 431
U.S. 767 (1977).
     1308 Miller v. California, 413 U.S. at 24.
     1309 It is the unprotected nature of obscenity that allows this inquiry; offensive-

ness to local community standards is, of course, a principle completely at odds with
mainstream First Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.
397 (1989); R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992).
     1310 413 U.S. at 30–34. “A juror is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the views

of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for mak-
ing the required determination, just as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of
the propensities of a ‘reasonable’ person in other areas of the law.” Hamling v. United
States, 418 U.S. 87, 104 (1974). The holding does not compel any particular circum-
scribed area to be used as a “community.” In federal cases, it will probably be the
judicial district from which the jurors are drawn, id. at 105–106. Indeed, the jurors
may be instructed to apply “community standards” without any definition being given
of the “community.” Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974). In a federal pros-
ecution for use of the mails to transmit pornography, the fact that the legislature of
the state within which the transaction takes place has abolished pornography regu-
