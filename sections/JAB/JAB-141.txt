lates constitutional limitations.” 723 Similarly, in Whitehill v. Elkins,724
an oath was voided because the Court thought it might include within
its proscription innocent membership in an organization that advo-
cated illegal overthrow of government.
    More recent cases do not illuminate whether membership changes
in the Court presage a change in view with regard to the loyalty-
oath question. In Connell v. Higginbotham 725 an oath provision read-
ing “that I do not believe in the overthrow of the Government of
the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence”
was invalidated because the statute provided for summary dis-
missal of an employee refusing to take the oath, with no opportu-
nity to explain that refusal. Cole v. Richardson 726 upheld a clause
in an oath “that I will oppose the overthrow of the government of
the United States of America or of this Commonwealth by force,
violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method” upon the con-
struction that this clause was mere “repetition, whether for empha-
sis or cadence,” of the first part of the oath, which was a valid “up-
hold and defend” positive oath.
    Legislative Investigations and the First Amendment.—
The power of inquiry by congressional and state legislative commit-
tees in order to develop information as a basis for legislation 727 is
subject to some uncertain limitation when the power as exercised
results in deterrence or penalization of protected beliefs, associa-
tions, and conduct. Although the Court initially indicated that it
would scrutinize closely such inquiries in order to curb First Amend-
ment infringement,728 later cases balanced the interests of the leg-
islative bodies in inquiring about both protected and unprotected
associations and conduct against what were perceived to be limited
restraints upon the speech and association rights of witnesses, and
upheld wide-ranging committee investigations.729 Later, the Court
placed the balance somewhat differently and required that the in-
     723 385 U.S. at 608. The statement here makes specific intent or active member-

ship alternatives in addition to knowledge, whereas Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S.
11, 19 (1966), requires both in addition to knowledge.
     724 389 U.S. 54 (1967). Justices Harlan, Stewart, and White dissented. Id. at

     725 403 U.S. 207 (1971).
     726 405 U.S. 676, 683–84 (1972).
     727 See subtopics under “Investigations in Aid of Legislation,” supra.
     728 See United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953); Watkins v. United States,

354 U.S. 178, 197–98 (1957); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 249–51 (1957).
Concurring in the last case, Justices Frankfurter and Harlan would have ruled that
the inquiry there was precluded by the First Amendment. Id. at 255.

365 U.S. 431 (1961). Chief Justice Warren and Justices Black, Douglas, and Bren-
nan dissented in each case.
