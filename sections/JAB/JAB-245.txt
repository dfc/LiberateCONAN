    Manual Enterprises v. Day 1291 upset a Post Office ban upon the
mailing of certain magazines addressed to homosexual audiences,
but resulted in no majority opinion of the Court. Nor did a major-
ity opinion emerge in Jacobellis v. Ohio, which reversed a convic-
tion for exhibiting a motion picture.1292 Chief Justice Warren’s con-
currence in Roth 1293 was adopted by a majority in Ginzburg v. United
States,1294 in which Justice Brennan for the Court held that in “close”
cases borderline materials could be determined to be obscene if the

materials not meeting constitutional standards for denomination as pornography, to
protect the sensibilities of some. It is up to offended individuals to turn away. Erznoznik
v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 208–12 (1975). But see Pinkus v. United States,
436 U.S. 293, 300 (1978) (jury in determining community standards must include
both “ ‘sensitive’ and ‘insensitive’ persons” in the community, but may not “focus[ ]
upon the most susceptible or sensitive members when judging the obscenity of ma-
terials . . . ”).
     1290 The First Amendment requires that procedures for suppressing distribution

of obscene materials provide for expedited consideration, for placing the burden of
proof on government, and for hastening judicial review. Additionally, Fourth Amend-
ment search and seizure law has been suffused with First Amendment principles,
so that the law governing searches for and seizures of allegedly obscene materials is
more stringent than in most other areas. Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717
(1961); A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, 378 U.S. 205 (1964); Heller v. New York, 413
U.S. 483 (1973); Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U.S. 496 (1973); Lo-Ji Sales v. New York,
442 U.S. 319 (1979); see also Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649 (1980). Scienter—
that is, knowledge of the nature of the materials—is a prerequisite to conviction,
Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147 (1959), but the prosecution need only prove the
defendant knew the contents of the material, not that he knew they were legally
obscene. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 119–24 (1974). See also Vance v.
Universal Amusement Co., 445 U.S. 308 (1980) (public nuisance injunction of show-
ing future films on basis of past exhibition of obscene films constitutes impermis-
sible prior restraint); McKinney v. Alabama, 424 U.S. 669 (1976) (criminal defen-
dants may not be bound by a finding of obscenity of materials in prior civil proceeding
to which they were not parties). None of these strictures applies, however, to forfei-
tures imposed as part of a criminal penalty. Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S.
544 (1993) (upholding RICO forfeiture of the entire adult entertainment book and
film business of an individual convicted of obscenity and racketeering offenses). Jus-
tice Kennedy, dissenting in Alexander, objected to the “forfeiture of expressive mate-
rial that had not been adjudged to be obscene.” Id. at 578.
     1291 370 U.S. 478 (1962).
     1292 378 U.S. 184 (1964). Without opinion, citing Jacobellis, the Court reversed

a judgment that Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer was obscene. Grove Press v. Gerstein,
378 U.S. 577 (1964). Jacobellis is best known for Justice Stewart’s concurrence, con-
tending that criminal prohibitions should be limited to “hard-core pornography.” The
category “may be indefinable,” he added, but “I know it when I see it, and the mo-
tion picture involved in this case is not that.” Id. at 197. The difficulty with this
visceral test is that other members of the Court did not always “see it” the same
way; two years later, for example, Justice Stewart was on opposite sides in two ob-
scenity decisions decided on the same day. A Book Named “John Cleland’s Memoirs
of a Woman of Pleasure” v. Attorney Genera, 383 U.S. 413 (1966) (concurring on
basis that book was not obscene); Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 518 (1966)
(dissenting from finding that material was obscene).
     1293 Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 494 (1957).
     1294 383 U.S. 463 (1966). Pandering remains relevant in pornography cases. Splawn

v. California, 431 U.S. 595 (1977); Pinkus v. United States, 436 U.S. 293, 303–04
(1978).
