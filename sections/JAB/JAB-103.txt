dubious intrusions.” 516 The “preferred-position” language was sharply
attacked by Justice Frankfurter in Kovacs v. Cooper,517 and it dropped
from the opinions, although its philosophy did not.
     Justice Black expressed his position in many cases but his
Konigsberg dissent contains one of the lengthiest and clearest expo-
sitions of it.518 That a particular governmental regulation abridged
speech or deterred it was to him “sufficient to render the action of
the State unconstitutional” because he did not subscribe “to the doc-
trine that permits constitutionally protected rights to be ‘balanced’
away whenever a majority of this Court thinks that a State might
have an interest sufficient to justify abridgment of those freedoms
. . . I believe that the First Amendment’s unequivocal command that
there shall be no abridgment of the rights of free speech and assem-
bly shows that the men who drafted our Bill of Rights did all the
‘balancing’ that was to be done in this field.” 519 As he wrote else-
where: “First Amendment rights are beyond abridgment either by
legislation that directly restrains their exercise or by suppression
or impairment through harassment, humiliation, or exposure by gov-
ernment.” 520 But the “First and Fourteenth Amendments . . . take
away from government, state and federal, all power to restrict free-
dom of speech, press, and assembly where people have a right to be
for such purposes. This does not mean, however, that these amend-
ments also grant a constitutional right to engage in the conduct of
picketing or patrolling, whether on publicly owned streets or on pri-
vately owned property.” 521 Thus, in his last years on the Court, Jus-
tice Black, while maintaining an “absolutist” position, increasingly
drew a line between “speech” and “conduct which involved commu-
nication.” 522
