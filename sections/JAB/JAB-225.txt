the only intent requirement for a true threat is that the defendant
intentionally or knowingly communicate the threat.” 1181
     Judge Alex Kozinski, in one of three dissenting opinions, agreed
with the majority’s definition of a true threat, but believed that the
majority had failed to apply it, because the speech in this case had
not been “communicated as a serious expression of intent to inflict
bodily harm. . . .” 1182 “The difference between a true threat and pro-
tected expression,” Judge Kozinski wrote, “is this: A true threat warns
of violence or other harm that the speaker controls. . . . Yet the opin-
ion points to no evidence that defendants who prepared the posters
would have been understood by a reasonable listener as saying that
they will cause the harm. . . . Given this lack of evidence, the post-
ers can be viewed, at most, as a call to arms for other abortion pro-
testers to harm plaintiffs. However, the Supreme Court made it clear
that under Brandenburg, encouragement or even advocacy of vio-
lence is protected by the First Amendment. . . .” 1183 Moreover, the
Court held in Claiborne that “[t]he mere fact the statements could
be understood ‘as intending to create a fear of violence’ was insuffi-
cient to make them ‘true threats’ under Watts.” 1184
    Group Libel, Hate Speech.—In Beauharnais v. Illinois,1185 re-
lying on dicta in past cases,1186 the Court upheld a state group li-
bel law that made it unlawful to defame a race or class of people.
The defendant had been convicted under this statute after he had
distributed a leaflet, part of which was in the form of a petition to
his city government, taking a hard-line white-supremacy position,
and calling for action to keep African Americans out of white neigh-
borhoods. Justice Frankfurter for the Court sustained the statute
along the following reasoning. Libel of an individual, he estab-
lished, was a common-law crime and was now made criminal by
statute in every state in the Union. These laws raise no constitu-
tional difficulty because libel is within that class of speech that is
not protected by the First Amendment. If an utterance directed at
an individual may be the object of criminal sanctions, then no good
reason appears to deny a state the power to punish the same utter-
ances when they are directed at a defined group, “unless we can
say that this is a willful and purposeless restriction unrelated to
the peace and well-being of the State.” 1187 The Justice then re-
    1181 290 F.3d at 1075.
    1182 290 F.3d at 1089 (quoting majority opinion at 1077 and adding emphasis).
