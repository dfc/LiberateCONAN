In Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,1348 the Court struck down
two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA),
one of which would have prohibited use of an “interactive computer
service” to display indecent material “in a manner available to a
person under 18 years of age.” 1349 This prohibition would, in effect,
have banned indecent material from all Internet sites except those
accessible by only by adults. Although intended “to deny minors ac-
cess to potentially harmful speech . . . , [the CDA’s] burden on adult
speech,” the Court wrote, “is unacceptable if less restrictive alterna-
tives would be at least as effective . . . . [T]he Government may
not ‘reduc[e] the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit for
children.’ ” 1350
     In Reno, the Court distinguished FCC v. Pacifica Founda-
tion,1351 in which it had upheld the FCC’s restrictions on indecent
radio and television broadcasts, because (1) “[t]he CDA’s broad cat-
egorical prohibitions are not limited to particular times and are not
dependent on any evaluation by an agency familiar with the unique
characteristics of the Internet,” (2) the CDA imposes criminal pen-
alties, and the Court has never decided whether indecent broad-
casts “would justify a criminal prosecution,” and (3) radio and tele-
vision, unlike the Internet, have, “as a matter of history . . . ‘received
the most limited First Amendment protection,’ . . . in large part be-
cause warnings could not adequately protect the listener from un-
expected program content. . . . [On the Internet], the risk of encoun-
tering indecent material by accident is remote because a series of
affirmative steps is required to access specific material.” 1352
    After the Supreme Court struck down the CDA, Congress en-
acted the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), which banned “ma-
terial that is harmful to minors” on Web sites that have the objec-

striction on speech.” The Court also would “not discount the possibility that a graphic
image could have a negative impact on a young child” (id. at 826), thereby suggest-
ing again that it may take age into account when applying strict scrutiny.
     1348 521 U.S. 844 (1997).
     1349 The other provision the Court struck down would have prohibited indecent

communications, by telephone, fax, or e-mail, to minors.
     1350 521 U.S. at 874–75. The Court did not address whether, if less restrictive

alternatives would not be as effective, the government would then be permitted to
reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children. Courts of appeals, how-
ever, have written that “[t]he State may not regulate at all if it turns out that even
the least restrictive means of regulation is still unreasonable when its limitations
on freedom of speech are balanced against the benefits gained from those limita-
tions.” ACLU v. Reno, 217 F.3d 162, 179 (3d Cir. 2000), vacated and remanded sub
nom., Ashcroft v. ACLU, 535 U.S. 564 (2002); Carlin Communications, Inc. v. FCC,
837 F.2d 546, 555 (2d Cir. 1988).
     1351 438 U.S. 726 (1978).
     1352 521 U.S. at 867.
