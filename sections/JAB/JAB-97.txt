bers and to commit them to a course whereby they will strike when
the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action by the govern-
ment is required.” 483 Therefore, what does the phrase “clear and
present danger” import for judgment? “Chief Judge Learned Hand,
writing for the majority below, interpreted the phrase as follows:
‘In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the “evil,”
discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech
as is necessary to avoid the danger.’ 183 F.2d at 212. We adopt this
statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as
succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It
takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and
relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.” 484
The “gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability” was found
to justify the convictions.485
    Balancing.—Clear and present danger as a test, it seems clear,
was a pallid restriction on governmental power after Dennis, and it
virtually disappeared from the Court’s language over the next twenty
years.486 Its replacement for part of this period was the much dis-
puted “balancing” test, which made its appearance the year before
Dennis in American Communications Ass’n v. Douds.487 There the
Court sustained a law barring from access to the NLRB any labor
union if any of its officers failed to file annually an oath disclaim-

    483  341 U.S. at 508, 509.
    484  341 U.S. at 510. Justice Frankfurter, concurring, adopted a balancing test,
id. at 517, discussed in the next topic. Justice Jackson appeared to proceed on a
conspiracy approach rather than one depending on advocacy. Id. at 561. Justices Black
and Douglas dissented, reasserting clear and present danger as the standard. Id. at
579, 581. Note the recurrence to the Learned Hand formulation in Nebraska Press
Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 562 (1976), although the Court appeared in fact to
apply balancing.
     485 In Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957), the Court substantially lim-

ited both the Smith Act and the Dennis case by interpreting the Act to require advo-
cacy of unlawful action, to require the urging of doing something now or in the fu-
ture, rather than merely advocacy of forcible overthrow as an abstract doctrine, and
by finding the evidence lacking to prove the former. Of Dennis, Justice Harlan wrote:
“The essence of the Dennis holding was that indoctrination of a group in prepara-
tion for future violent action, as well as exhortation to immediate action, by advo-
cacy found to be directed to ‘action for the accomplishment’ of forcible overthrow, to
violence as ‘a rule or principle of action,’ and employing ‘language of incitement,’ id.
at 511–12, is not constitutionally protected when the group is of sufficient size and
cohesiveness, is sufficiently oriented towards action, and other circumstances are such
as reasonably to justify apprehension that action will occur.” Id. at 321.

First Amendment, 79 HARV. L. REV. 1, 8 (1965). See Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S.
157, 185–207 (1961) (Justice Harlan concurring).
     487 339 U.S. 382 (1950). See also Osman v. Douds, 339 U.S. 846 (1950). Balanc-

ing language was used by Justice Black in his opinion for the Court in Martin v.
City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 143 (1943), but it seems not to have influenced the
decision. Similarly, in Schneider v. Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 161–62 (1939), Justice
Roberts used balancing language that he apparently did not apply.
