“that a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to
speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so.” 1527 The
ordinance violated the right to anonymity, burdened the freedom of
speech of those who hold “religious or patriotic views” that prevent
them from applying for a license, and effectively banned “a signifi-
cant amount of spontaneous speech” that might be engaged in on a
holiday or weekend when it was not possible to obtain a permit.1528
    The Problem of “Symbolic Speech”.—Very little expression
is “mere” speech. If it is oral, it may be noisy enough to be disturb-
ing,1529 and, if it is written, it may be litter; 1530 in either case, it
may amount to conduct that is prohibitable in specific circum-
stances.1531 Moving beyond these simple examples, one may see as
well that conduct may have a communicative content, intended to
express a point of view. Expressive conduct may consist in flying a
particular flag as a symbol 1532 or in refusing to salute a flag as a
symbol.1533 Sit-ins and stand-ins may effectively express a protest
about certain things.1534
    Justice Jackson wrote: “There is no doubt that, in connection
with the pledge, the flag salute is a form of utterance. Symbolism
is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas. The use of
an emblem or flag to symbolize some system, idea, institution, or
personality is a short cut from mind to mind.” 1535 When conduct or
action has a communicative content to it, governmental regulation
or prohibition implicates the First Amendment, but this does not
mean that such conduct or action is necessarily immune from gov-
ernmental process. Thus, although the Court has had few opportu-
nities to formulate First Amendment standards in this area, in up-
    1527  536 U.S. at 165–66.
    1528  536 U.S. at 167.
     1529 E.g., Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558 (1948); Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77

(1949).
     1530 E.g., Schneider v. Town of Irvington, 308 U.S. 147 (1939).
     1531 Cf. Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).
     1532 Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931).

     1534 In Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131 (1966), the Court held protected a peace-

ful, silent stand-in in a segregated public library. Speaking of speech and assembly,
Justice Fortas said for the Court: “As this Court has repeatedly stated, these rights
are not confined to verbal expression. They embrace appropriate types of action which
certainly include the right in a peaceable and orderly manner to protest by silent
and reproachful presence, in a place where the protestant has every right to be, the
unconstitutional segregation of public facilities.” Id. at 141–42. See also Garner v.
Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 185, 201 (1961) (Justice Harlan concurring). On a different
footing is expressive conduct in a place where such conduct is prohibited for reasons
other than suppressing speech. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U.S. 288 (1984) (upholding Park Service restriction on overnight sleeping as
applied to demonstrators wishing to call attention to the plight of the homeless).
