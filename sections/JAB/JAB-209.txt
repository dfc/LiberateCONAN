casters to afford persons an opportunity to reply if they were at-
tacked on the air on the basis of their “honesty, character, integrity
or like personal qualities,” or if they were legally qualified candi-
dates and a broadcast editorial endorsed their opponent or opposed
them.1089 In Red Lion, Justice White explained that “differences in
the characteristics of [various] media justify differences in First Amend-
ment standards applied to them.” 1090 Thus, although everyone has
a right to speak, write, or publish as he will, subject to very few
limitations, there is no comparable right of everyone to broadcast.
The frequencies are limited and some few must be given the privi-
lege over others. The particular licensee, however, has no First Amend-
ment right to hold that license and his exclusive privilege may be
qualified. Qualification by censorship of content is impermissible,
but the First Amendment does not prevent a governmental insis-
tence that a licensee “conduct himself as a proxy or fiduciary with
obligations to present those views and voices which are representa-
tive of his community and which would otherwise, by necessity, be
barred from the airwaves.” 1091 Furthermore, said Justice White, “[b]e-
cause of the scarcity of radio frequencies, the government is permit-
ted to put restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views
should be expressed on this unique medium. But the people as a
whole retain their interest in free speech by radio and their collec-
tive right to have the medium function consistently with the ends
and purposes of the First Amendment. It is the right of the view-
ers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is para-
mount.” 1092 The broadcasters had argued that, if they were re-
quired to provide equal time at their expense to persons attacked
and to points of view different from those expressed on the air, ex-
pression would be curbed through self-censorship, for fear of contro-
versy and economic loss. Justice White thought this possibility “at
best speculative,” but if it should materialize “the Commission is
not powerless to insist that they give adequate and fair attention
to public issues.” 1093
