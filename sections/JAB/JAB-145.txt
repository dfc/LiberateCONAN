Particular Governmental Regulations That Restrict
 Expression
    Government adopts and enforces many measures that are de-
signed to further a valid interest but that may restrict freedom of
expression. As an employer, government is interested in attaining
and maintaining full production from its employees in a harmoni-
ous environment. As enforcer of the democratic method of carrying
out the selection of public officials, it is interested in outlawing “cor-
rupt practices” and promoting a fair and smoothly functioning elec-
toral process. As regulator of economic affairs, its interests are ex-
tensive. As educator, it desires to impart knowledge and training to
the young with as little distraction as possible. All these interests
may be achieved with some restriction upon expression, but, if the
regulation goes too far, then it will violate the First Amendment.746
    Government as Employer: Political and Other Outside Ac-
tivities.—Abolition of the “spoils system” in federal employment
brought with it restrictions on political activities by federal employ-
ees. In 1876, federal employees were prohibited from requesting from,
giving to, or receiving from any other federal employee money for
political purposes, and the Civil Service Act of 1883 more broadly
forbade civil service employees to use their official authority or in-
fluence to coerce political action of any person or to interfere with
elections.747 By the Hatch Act, federal employees, and many state
employees as well, are forbidden to “take any active part in politi-
cal management or in political campaigns.” 748 As applied through
the regulations and rulings of the Office of Personnel Management,
     746 Highly relevant in this and subsequent sections dealing with governmental

incidental restraints upon expression is the distinction the Court has drawn be-
tween content-based and content-neutral regulations—a distinction between regula-
tions that serve legitimate governmental interests and those that are imposed be-
cause of disapproval of the content of particular expression. Compare Police Dep’t of
Chicago v. Mosle, 408 U.S. 92 (1972); Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S.
205 (1975); and Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970), with Greer v. Spock,
424 U.S. 828 (1976); Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Car-
riers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973); and United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968). Content-
based regulations are subject to strict scrutiny, but content-neutral regulations are
subject to lesser scrutiny. See “Modern Tests and Standards: Vagueness, Overbreadth,

     747 19 Stat. 143, § 6, 18 U.S.C. §§ 602–03, sustained in Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S.

371 (1882); 22 Stat. 403, as amended, 5 U.S.C. § 7323.
     748 53 Stat. 1147 § 9(a), (1939), as amended, 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a)(2). By 54 Stat.

767 (1940), as amended, 5 U.S.C. §§ 1501–08, the restrictions on political activity
were extended to state and local governmental employees working in programs fi-
nanced in whole or in part with federal funds. This provision was sustained against
federalism challenges in Oklahoma v. Civil Service Comm’n, 330 U.S. 127 (1947).
All the states have adopted laws patterned on the Hatch Act. See Broadrick v. Okla-
homa, 413 U.S. 601, 604 (1973).
