Speech Plus—The Constitutional Law of Leafleting,
 Picketing, and Demonstrating
     Communication of political, economic, social, and other views is
not accomplished solely by face-to-face speech, broadcast speech, or
writing in newspapers, periodicals, and pamphlets. There is also “ex-
pressive conduct,” which includes picketing and marching, distribu-
tion of leaflets and pamphlets, addresses to publicly assembled au-
diences, door-to-door solicitation, and sit-ins. There is also a class
of conduct, now only vaguely defined, that has been denominated
“symbolic conduct,” which includes such actions as flag desecration
and draft-card burnings. Because all these ways of expressing one-
self involve conduct rather than mere speech, they are all much more
subject to regulation and restriction than is simple speech. Some of
them may be forbidden altogether. But, to the degree that these
actions are intended to communicate a point of view, the First Amend-
ment is relevant and protects some of them to a great extent. Sort-
ing out the conflicting lines of principle and doctrine is the point of
this section.
     The Public Forum.—In 1895, while on the highest court of Mas-
sachusetts, future Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes rejected a conten-
tion that public property was by right open to the public as a place
where the right of speech could be recognized,1382 and on review
the United States Supreme Court endorsed Holmes’ view.1383 Years
later, beginning with Hague v. CIO,1384 the Court reconsidered the
issue. Justice Roberts wrote in Hague: “Wherever the title of streets
and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for
the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for
purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and
discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places
has from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities,
rights, and liberties of citizens.” Although this opinion was not it-
self joined by a majority of the Justices, the Court subsequently en-
dorsed the view in several opinions.1385

    1382 Commonwealth v. Davis, 162 Mass. 510, 511 (1895). “For the Legislature

absolutely or conditionally to forbid public speaking in a highway or public park is
no more an infringement of rights of a member of the public than for the owner of a
private house to forbid it in the house.”
    1383 Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U.S. 43, 48 (1897).
    1384 307 U.S. 496 (1939). Only Justice Black joined the Roberts opinion, but only

Justices McReynolds and Butler dissented from the result.
    1385 E.g., Schneider v. Town of Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 163 (1939); Kunz v. New

York, 340 U.S. 290, 293 (1951).
