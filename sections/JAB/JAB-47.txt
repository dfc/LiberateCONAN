ernment has drawn” 213 in order that it be held to violate the Estab-
lishment Clause. The classification here was not religiously based
“on its face,” and served “a number of valid purposes having noth-
ing to do with a design to foster or favor any sect, religion, or clus-
ter of religions.” 214 These purposes, related to the difficulty in sepa-
rating sincere conscientious objectors to particular wars from others
with fraudulent claims, included the maintenance of a fair and effi-
cient selective service system and protection of the integrity of demo-
cratic decision-making.215
    Regulation of Religious Solicitation.—Although the solicita-
tion cases have generally been decided under the free exercise or
free speech clauses,216 in one instance the Court, intertwining es-
tablishment and free exercise principles, voided a provision in a state
charitable solicitations law that required only those religious orga-
nizations that received less than half their total contributions from
members or affiliated organizations to comply with the registration
and reporting sections of the law.217 Applying strict scrutiny equal
protection principles, the Court held that, by distinguishing be-
tween older, well-established churches that had strong member-
ship financial support and newer bodies lacking a contributing con-
stituency or that may favor public solicitation over general reliance
on financial support from the members, the statute granted denomi-
national preference forbidden by the Establishment Clause.218
    Religion in Governmental Observances.—The practice of open-
ing legislative sessions with prayers by paid chaplains was upheld
in Marsh v. Chambers,219 a case involving prayers in the Nebraska
legislature. The Court relied almost entirely on historical practice.
Congress had paid a chaplain and opened sessions with prayers for
almost 200 years; the fact that Congress had continued the prac-
tice after considering constitutional objections in the Court’s view
strengthened rather than weakened the historical argument. Simi-
larly, the practice was well rooted in Nebraska and in most other

    214   401 U.S. at 452.
      215 401 U.S. at 452–60.

      217 Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982). Two Justices dissented on the mer-

its, id. at 258 (Justices White and Rehnquist), while two other Justices dissented on
a standing issue. Id. at 264 (Chief Justice Burger and Justice O’Connor).
      218 456 U.S. at 246–51. Compare Heffron v. ISKCON, 452 U.S. 640, 652–53 (1981),

and id. at 659 n.3 (Justice Brennan, concurring in part and dissenting in part) (deal-
ing with a facially neutral solicitation rule distinguishing between religious groups
that have a religious tenet requiring peripatetic solicitation and those who do not).
      219 463 U.S. 783 (1983). Marsh was a 6–3 decision, with Chief Justice Burger’s

opinion for the Court being joined by Justices White, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist,
and O’Connor, and with Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens dissenting.
