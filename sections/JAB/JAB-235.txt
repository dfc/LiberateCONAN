rial processes in the establishment of “actual malice.” 1235 The state
of mind of the defendant may be inquired into and the thoughts,
opinions, and conclusions with respect to the material gathered and
its review and handling are proper subjects of discovery. As with
other areas of protection or qualified protection under the First Amend-
ment (as well as some other constitutional provisions), appellate courts,
and ultimately the Supreme Court, must independently review the
findings below to ascertain that constitutional standards were met.1236
    There had been some indications that statements of opinion, un-
like assertions of fact, are absolutely protected,1237 but the Court
held in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.1238 that there is no consti-
tutional distinction between fact and opinion, hence no “wholesale
defamation exemption” for any statement that can be labeled “opin-
ion.” 1239 The issue instead is whether, regardless of the context in
which a statement is uttered, it is sufficiently factual to be suscep-
tible of being proved true or false. Thus, if statements of opinion
may “reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an in-
dividual,” 1240 then the truthfulness of the factual assertions may
be tested in a defamation action. There are sufficient protections
for free public discourse already available in defamation law, the
Court concluded, without creating “an artificial dichotomy between
‘opinion’ and fact.” 1241
    Substantial meaning is also the key to determining whether in-
exact quotations are defamatory. Journalistic conventions allow some
alterations to correct grammar and syntax, but the Court in Mas-

that only media defendants are protected under the press clause and individuals
and others are not protected by the speech clause in defamation actions. See discus-
sion, supra, under “Freedom of Expression: Is There a Difference Between Speech
and Press?”

     1236 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284–86 (1964). See, e.g., NAACP

tions v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688 (1989) (“the reviewing court must consider
the factual record in full”); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, 466
U.S. 485 (1984) (the “clearly erroneous” standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
52(a) must be subordinated to this constitutional principle).
     1237 See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974) (“under the

First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea”); Greenbelt Cooperative
Publishing Ass’n v. Bresler, 398 U.S. 6 (1970) (holding protected the accurate report-
ing of a public meeting in which a particular position was characterized as “black-
mail”); Letter Carriers v. Austin, 418 U.S. 264 (1974) (holding protected a union news-
paper’s use of epithet “scab”).

     1239 497 U.S. at 18.
     1240 497 U.S. at 20. In Milkovich the Court held to be actionable assertions and

implications in a newspaper sports column that a high school wrestling coach had
committed perjury in testifying about a fight involving his team.
