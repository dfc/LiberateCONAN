pliance with the injunction.” 1491 The Court also upheld a “provision,
specifying that once sidewalk counselors who had entered the buf-
fer zones were required to ‘cease and desist’ their counseling, they
had to retreat 15 feet from the people they had been counseling
and had to remain outside the boundaries of the buffer zones.” 1492
     In Hill v. Colorado,1493 the Court upheld a Colorado statute that
made it unlawful, within 100 feet of the entrance to any health care
facility, to “knowingly approach” within eight feet of another per-
son, without that person’s consent, “for the purpose of passing a
leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral pro-
test, education, or counseling with such other person.” 1494 This de-
cision is notable because it upheld a statute, and not, as in Madsen
and Schenck, merely an injunction directed to particular parties.
The Court found the statute to be a content-neutral time, place, and
manner regulation of speech that “reflects an acceptable balance be-
tween the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding speakers
and the interests of unwilling listeners . . . .” 1495 The restrictions
were content-neutral because they regulated only the places where
some speech may occur, and because they applied equally to all dem-
onstrators, regardless of viewpoint. Although the restrictions did not
apply to all speech, the “kind of cursory examination” that might
be required to distinguish casual conversation from protest, educa-
tion, or counseling is not “problematic.” 1496 The law was narrowly
tailored to achieve the state’s interests. The eight-foot restriction
did not significantly impair the ability to convey messages by signs,
and ordinarily allowed speakers to come within a normal conversa-
tional distance of their targets. Because the statute allowed the speaker
to remain in one place, persons who wished to hand out leaflets
could position themselves beside entrances near the path of oncom-
ing pedestrians, and consequently were not deprived of the oppor-
tunity to get the attention of persons entering a clinic.
     Different types of issues were presented by Hurley v. Irish-
American Gay Group,1497 in which the Court held that a state’s pub-
lic accommodations law could not be applied to compel private orga-
nizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade to accept in the parade a unit
that would proclaim a message that the organizers did not wish to
promote. Each participating unit affects the message conveyed by
the parade organizers, the Court observed, and application of the
