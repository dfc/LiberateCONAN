gious use of the tests was sustained even though the Court recog-
nized the incidental benefit to the schools.104
     The “child benefit” theory, under which it is permissible for gov-
ernment to render ideologically neutral assistance and services to
pupils in sectarian schools without being deemed to be aiding the
religious mission of the schools, has not proved easy to apply. Sev-
eral different forms of assistance to students were at issue in Wol-
man v. Walter.105 The Court approved the following: standardized
tests and scoring services used in the public schools, with private
school personnel not involved in the test drafting and scoring; speech,
hearing, and psychological diagnostic services provided in the pri-
vate schools by public employees; and therapeutic, guidance, and
remedial services for students provided off the premises of the pri-
vate schools. In all these, the Court thought the program contained
adequate built-in protections against religious use. But, though the
Court adhered to its ruling permitting the states to lend secular
textbooks used in the public schools to pupils attending religious
schools,106 it declined to extend the precedent to permit the states
to lend to pupils or their parents instructional materials and equip-
ment, such as projectors, tape recorders, maps, globes and science
kits, even though the materials and equipment were identical to

Justices Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens dissented. Id. at 662, 671. The
dissenters thought that the authorization of direct reimbursement grants was distin-
guishable from previously approved plans that had merely relieved the private schools
of the costs of preparing and grading state-prepared tests. See Wolman v. Walter,
433 U.S. 229, 238–41 (1977).
     105 433 U.S. 229 (1977). The Court deemed the situation in which these services

were performed and the nature of the services to occasion little danger of aiding
religious functions and thus requiring little supervision that would give rise to en-
tanglement. All the services fell “within that class of general welfare services for
children that may be provided by the States regardless of the incidental benefit that
accrues to church-related schools.” Id. at 243, quoting Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S.
349, 371 n.21 (1975). Justice Brennan would have voided all the programs because,
considered as a whole, the amount of assistance was so large as to constitute assis-
tance to the religious mission of the schools. 433 U.S. at 255. Justice Marshall would
have approved only the diagnostic services, id. at 256, while Justice Stevens would
generally approve closely administered public health services. Id. at 264.
     106 Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 359–72 (1975); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S.

229, 236–38 (1977). Allen was explained as resting on “the unique presumption” that
“the educational content of textbooks is something that can be ascertained in ad-
vance and cannot be diverted to sectarian uses.” There was “a tension” between Ny-
quist, Meek, and Wolman, on the one hand, and Allen on the other; although Allen
was to be followed “as a matter of stare decisis,” the “presumption of neutrality”
embodied in Allen would not be extended to other similar assistance. Id. at 251 n.18.
A later Court majority revived the Allen presumption, however, applying it to up-
hold tax deductions for tuition and other school expenses in Mueller v. Allen, 463
U.S. 388 (1983). Justice Rehnquist wrote the Court’s opinion, joined by Justices White,
Powell, and O’Connor, and by Chief Justice Burger.
