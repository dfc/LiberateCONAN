     Child Pornography.—In New York v. Ferber,1328 the Court rec-
ognized another category of expression that is outside the coverage
of the First Amendment: the visual depiction of children in films or
still photographs in a variety of sexual activities or exposures of
the genitals. The reason that such depictions may be prohibited was
the governmental interest in protecting the physical and psychologi-
cal well-being of children, whose participation in the production of
these materials would subject them to exploitation and harm. The
state may go beyond a mere prohibition of the use of children, be-
cause it is not possible to protect children adequately without pro-
hibiting the exhibition and dissemination of the materials and ad-
vertising about them. Thus, “the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly
outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process
of case-by-case adjudication is required.” 1329 But, because expres-
sion is involved, the government must carefully define what con-
duct is to be prohibited and may reach only “works that visually
depict sexual conduct by children below a specified age.” 1330
    The reach of the state may even extend to private possession of
child pornography in the home. In Osborne v. Ohio 1331 the Court
upheld a state law criminalizing the possession or viewing of child
pornography as applied to someone who possessed such materials
in his home. Distinguishing Stanley v. Georgia, the Court ruled that
Ohio’s interest in preventing exploitation of children far exceeded
what it characterized as Georgia’s “paternalistic interest” in protect-
ing the minds of adult viewers of pornography.1332 Because of the
greater importance of the state interest involved, the Court saw less
need to require states to demonstrate a strong necessity for regulat-
ing private possession as well as commercial distribution and sale.
    In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Court held unconstitu-
tional the federal Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) to the
extent that it prohibited pictures that were not produced with ac-

    1327 495 U.S. at 109–10.
    1328 458 U.S. 747 (1982). Decision of the Court was unanimous, although there
were several limiting concurrences. Compare, e.g., 775 (Justice Brennan, arguing for
exemption of “material with serious literary, scientific, or educational value”), with
774 (Justice O’Connor, arguing that such material need not be excepted). The Court
did not pass on the question, inasmuch as the materials before it were well within
the prohibitable category. Id. at 766–74.
    1329 458 U.S. at 763–64.
    1330 458 U.S. at 764 (emphasis original). Child pornography need not meet Miller

obscenity standards to be unprotected by the First Amendment. Id. at 764–65.
    1331 495 U.S. 103 (1990).
    1332 495 U.S. at 108.
