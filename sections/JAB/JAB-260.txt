eral applicability directed at conduct rather than expression.1371 All
but one of the Justices agreed that nude dancing is entitled to some
First Amendment protection,1372 but the result of Barnes was a bare
minimum of protection. Numerous questions remain unanswered.
In addition to the uncertainty over applicability of Barnes to regu-
lation of the content of films or other shows in “adult” theaters,1373
there is also the issue of its applicability to nudity in operas or the-
atrical productions not normally associated with commercial exploi-
tation of sex.1374 But broad implications for First Amendment doc-
trine are probably unwarranted.1375 The Indiana statute was not

     1371 501 U.S. at 572 (Justice Scalia). The Justice thus favored application of the

same approach applied to free exercise of religion in Employment Division v. Smith,
494 U.S. 872 (1990).
     1372 Earlier cases had established as much. See California v. LaRue, 409 U.S.

109, 118 (1972); Southeastern Promotions v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557–58 (1975);
Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 932 (1975); Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 66 (1981); New York State Liquor Auth. v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714, 716,
718 (1981). Presumably, then, the distinction between barroom erotic dancing, en-
titled to minimum protection, and social “ballroom” dancing, not expressive and hence
not entitled to First Amendment protection (see City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S.
19, 24 (1989)), still hangs by a few threads. Justice Souter, concurring in Barnes,
501 U.S. 560, 587 (1991), recognized the validity of the distinction between ball-
room and erotic dancing, a validity that had been questioned by a dissent in the
lower court. Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081, 1128–29 (7th Cir.
1990) (Easterbrook, J.).
     1373 Although Justice Souter relied on what were essentially zoning cases (Young

v. American Mini Theatres and Renton v. Playtime Theatres) to justify regulation of
expression itself, he nonetheless pointed out that a pornographic movie featuring
one of the respondent dancers was playing nearby without interference by the au-
thorities. This suggests that, at least with respect to direct regulation of the degree
of permissible nudity, he might draw a distinction between “live” and film perfor-
mances even while acknowledging the harmful “secondary” effects associated with
both.
     1374 The Court has not ruled directly on such issues. See Southeastern Promo-

tions v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546 (1975) (invalidating the denial of use of a public audi-
torium for a production of the musical “Hair,” in the absence of procedural safe-
guards that must accompany a system of prior restraint). Presumably the Barnes
plurality’s public-morality rationale would apply equally to the “adult” stage and to
the operatic theater, while Justice Souter’s secondary effects rationale would not.
But the plurality ducked this issue, reinterpreting the lower court record to deny
that Indiana had distinguished between “adult” and theatrical productions. 501 U.S.
at 564 n.1 (Chief Justice Rehnquist); id. at 574 n.2 (Justice Scalia). On the other
hand, the fact that the state authorities disclaimed any intent to apply the statute
to theatrical productions demonstrated to dissenting Justice White (who was joined
by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens) that the statute was not a general
prohibition on public nudity, but instead was targeted at “the communicative aspect
of the erotic dance.” Id. at 591.
     1375 The Court had only recently affirmed that music is entitled to First Amend-

ment protection independently of the message conveyed by any lyrics (Ward v. Rock
Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989)), so it seems implausible that the Court was
signaling a narrowing of protection to only ideas and opinions. Rather, the Court
seems willing to give government the benefit of the doubt when it comes to legiti-
mate objectives in regulating expressive conduct that is sexually explicit. For an ex-
