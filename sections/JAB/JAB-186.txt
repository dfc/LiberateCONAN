ness of a regulation at issue.” 968 “First, is there a valid, rational
connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate govern-
mental interest put forward to justify it? Second, are there alterna-
tive means of exercising the right that remain open to prison in-
mates? Third, what impact will accommodation of the asserted
constitutional right . . . have on guards and other inmates, and on
the allocation of prison resources generally? And, fourth, are ready
alternatives for furthering the governmental interest available?” 969
Two years after Turner v. Safley, in Thornburgh v. Abbott, the Court
restricted Procunier v. Martinez to the regulation of outgoing corre-
spondence, finding that the needs of prison security justify a more
deferential standard for prison regulations restricting incoming ma-
terial, whether those incoming materials are correspondence from
other prisoners, correspondence from nonprisoners, or outside pub-
lications.970
    In Beard v. Banks, a plurality of the Supreme Court upheld “a
Pennsylvania prison policy that ‘denies newspapers, magazines, and
photographs’ to a group of specially dangerous and recalcitrant in-
mates.” 971 These inmates were housed in Pennsylvania’s Long Term
Segregation Unit and one of the prison’s penological rationales for
its policy, which the plurality found to satisfy the four Turner fac-
tors, was to motivate better behavior on the part of the prisoners
by providing them with an incentive to move back to the regular
prison population.972 Applying the four Turner factors to this ratio-
nale, the plurality found that (1) there was a logical connection be-
tween depriving inmates of newspapers and magazines and provid-
ing an incentive to improve behavior; (2) the Policy provided no
alternatives to the deprivation of newspapers and magazines, but
this was “not ‘conclusive’ of the reasonableness of the Policy”; (3)
the impact of accommodating the asserted constitutional right would
be negative; and (4) no alternative would “fully accommodate the
prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological inter-
ests.” 973 The plurality believed that its “real task in this case is
not balancing these factors, but rather determining whether the Sec-

deny prisoners publications on the basis of their content, but the grounds on which
the regulations do so is content-neutral (e.g., to protect prison security), then the
regulations will be deemed neutral. Id. at 415–16.
