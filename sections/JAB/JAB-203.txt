restraints may be inapplicable.1060 Further, disseminators of com-
mercial speech are not protected by the overbreadth doctrine.1061
On the other hand, there are circumstances in which the nature of
the restriction placed on commercial speech may alter the First Amend-
ment analysis, and even result in the application of a heightened
level of scrutiny.
    For instance, in Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc.,1062 the Court struck
down state restrictions on pharmacies and “data-miners” selling or
leasing information on the prescribing behavior of doctors for mar-
keting purposes and related restrictions limiting the use of that in-
formation by pharmaceutical companies.1063 These prohibitions, how-
ever, were subject to a number of exceptions, including provisions
allowing such prescriber-identifying information to be used for health
care research. Because the restrictions only applied to the use of
this information for marketing and because they principally ap-
plied to pharmaceutical manufacturers of non-generic drugs, the Court
found that these restrictions were content-based and speaker-
based limits and thus subject to heightened scrutiny.1064
    Different degrees of protection may also be discerned among dif-
ferent categories of commercial speech. The first prong of the Cen-
tral Hudson test means that false, deceptive, or misleading adver-
tisements need not be permitted; government may require that a
commercial message appear in such a form, or include such addi-
tional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to

Court refused to accept a times, places, and manner defense of an ordinance prohib-
iting “For Sale” signs on residential lawns. First, ample alternative channels of com-
munication were not available, and second, the ban was seen rather as a content
limitation.

     1063 “Detailers,” marketing specialists employed by pharmaceutical manufactur-

ers, used the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.
     1064 Although the state put forward a variety of proposed governmental inter-

ests to justify the regulations, the Court found these interests (expectation of physi-
cian privacy, discouraging harassment of physicians, and protecting the integrity of
the doctor-physician relationship) were ill-served by the content-based restrictions.
564 U.S. ___, No. 10–779, slip op. at 17–21. The Court also rejected the argument
that the regulations were an appropriate way to reduce health care costs, noting
that “[t]he State seeks to achieve its policy objectives through the indirect means of
restraining certain speech by certain speakers—that is, by diminishing detailers’ abil-
ity to influence prescription decisions. Those who seek to censor or burden free ex-
pression often assert that disfavored speech has adverse effects. But the ‘fear that
people would make bad decisions if given truthful information’ cannot justify content-
based burdens on speech.” Id. at 21–22.
