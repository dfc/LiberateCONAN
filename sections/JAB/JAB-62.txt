goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious
observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means
which do not impose such a burden.” 298
     Within two years the Court in Sherbert v. Verner 299 reversed
this line of analysis to require a religious exemption from a secu-
lar, regulatory piece of economic legislation. Sherbert was disquali-
fied from receiving unemployment compensation because, as a Sev-
enth Day Adventist, she would not accept Saturday work; according
to state officials, this meant she was not complying with the statu-
tory requirement to stand ready to accept suitable employment. If
this denial of benefits is to be upheld, the Court said, “it must be
either because her disqualification as a beneficiary represents no
infringement by the State of her constitutional rights of free exer-
cise, or because any incidental burden on the free exercise of appel-
lant’s religions may be justified by a ‘compelling state interest in
the regulation of a subject within the State’s constitutional power
to regulate . . . .’ ” 300 First, the disqualification was held to impose
a burden on the free exercise of Sherbert’s religion; it was an indi-
rect burden and it did not impose a criminal sanction on a reli-
gious practice, but the disqualification derived solely from her prac-
tice of her religion and constituted a compulsion upon her to forgo
that practice.301 Second, there was no compelling interest demon-
strated by the state. The only interest asserted was the prevention
of the possibility of fraudulent claims, but that was merely a bare
assertion. Even if there was a showing of demonstrable danger, “it
would plainly be incumbent upon the appellees to demonstrate that
no alternative forms of regulation would combat such abuses with-
out infringing First Amendment rights.” 302

     298 366 U.S. at 607 (plurality opinion). The concurrence balanced the economic

disadvantage suffered by the Sabbatarians against the important interest of the state
in securing its day of rest regulation. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. at 512–22.
Three Justices dissented. Id. at 561 (Justice Douglas); Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S.
at 610 (Justice Brennan), 616 (Justice Stewart).
     299 374 U.S. 398 (1963).
     300 374 U.S. at 403, quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963).
     301 374 U.S. at 403–06.
     302 374 U.S. at 407. Braunfeld was distinguished because of “a countervailing

factor which finds no equivalent in the instant case—a strong state interest in pro-
viding one uniform day of rest for all workers.” That secular objective could be achieved,
the Court found, only by declaring Sunday to be that day of rest. Requiring exemp-
tions for Sabbatarians, while theoretically possible, appeared to present an adminis-
trative problem of such magnitude, or to afford the exempted class so great a com-
petitive advantage, that such a requirement would have rendered the entire statutory
scheme unworkable. Id. at 408–09. Other Justices thought that Sherbert overruled
Braunfeld. Id. at 413, 417 (Justice Stewart concurring), 418 (Justice Harlan and White
dissenting).
