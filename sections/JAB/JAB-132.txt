bidden to put down force and violence, it is not forbidden to punish
its teaching or advocacy, and the end being punishable, there is no
doubt of the power to punish conspiracy for the purpose.” 677 Jus-
tices Black and Douglas dissented separately, the former viewing
the Smith Act as an invalid prior restraint and calling for reversal
of the convictions for lack of a clear and present danger, the latter
applying the Holmes-Brandeis formula of clear and present danger
to conclude that “[t]o believe that petitioners and their following
are placed in such critical positions as to endanger the Nation is to
believe the incredible.” 678
     In Yates v. United States,679 the convictions of several second-
string Communist Party leaders were set aside, a number ordered
acquitted, and others remanded for retrial. The decision was based
upon construction of the statute and appraisal of the evidence rather
than on First Amendment claims, although each prong of the rul-
ing seems to have been informed with First Amendment consider-
ations. Thus, Justice Harlan for the Court wrote that the trial judge
had given faulty instructions to the jury in advising that all advo-
cacy and teaching of forcible overthrow was punishable, whether it
was language of incitement or not, so long as it was done with an
intent to accomplish that purpose. But the statute, the Justice con-
tinued, prohibited “advocacy of action,” not merely “advocacy in the
realm of ideas.” “The essential distinction is that those to whom
the advocacy is addressed must be urged to do something, now or
in the future, rather than merely to believe in something.” 680 Sec-
ond, the Court found the evidence insufficient to establish that the
Communist Party had engaged in the required advocacy of action,
requiring the Government to prove such advocacy in each instance
rather than presenting evidence generally about the Party. Addition-
ally, the Court found the evidence insufficient to link five of the de-
fendants to advocacy of action, but sufficient with regard to the other
nine.681

by which certain advocacy could be punished was noticeably stiffened in Brandenburg
v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969).
