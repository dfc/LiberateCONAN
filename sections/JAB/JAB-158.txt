     While it is unclear whether this holding would extend beyond
the college level to students in high school or below who are more
“impressionable” and perhaps less able to appreciate that equal ac-
cess does not compromise a school’s neutrality toward religion,810
Congress has done so by statute.811 On the other hand, a public
university that imposed an “accept-all-comers” policy on student groups
as a condition of receiving the financial and other benefits of offi-
cial school recognition did not impair a student religious group’s right
to expressive association, because the school’s policy was reason-
able and viewpoint neutral.812
     When faced with another conflict between a school system’s ob-
ligation to inculcate community values in students and the free-
speech rights of those students, the Court splintered badly, remand-
ing for full trial a case challenging the authority of a school board
to remove certain books from high school and junior high school
libraries.813 In dispute were the school board’s reasons for remov-
ing the books—whether, as the board alleged, because of vulgarity
and other content-neutral reasons, or whether also because of politi-
cal disagreement with contents. The plurality conceded that school
boards must be permitted “to establish and apply their curriculum
in such a way as to transmit community values,” and that “there is
a legitimate and substantial community interest in promoting re-
spect for authority and traditional values be they social, moral, or
political.” At the same time, the plurality thought that students re-
tained substantial free-speech protections and that among these was
the right to receive information and ideas. Carefully limiting its dis-
cussion to the removal of books from a school library, and exclud-
ing the question of the acquisition of books as well as questions of
school curricula, the plurality held a school board constitutionally

Stat. 1302, 20 U.S.C. §§ 4071–74, Congress applied the same “limited open [public]
forum” principles to public high schools, and the Court upheld the Act against First
Amendment challenge. Westside Community Bd. of Educ. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226

The Court did not address the more difficult question raised by the school’s written
policy, which forbade discrimination, among other things, based on religion or sexual
orientation, because the parties stipulated that in practice student groups were re-
quired to accept all students who complied with neutral membership requirements
(e.g., payment of dues). Id. at 11–12. Thus, the Court did not address whether the
application of the narrower written anti-discrimination policies constituted view-
point discrimination against a student group that required its members to adhere
to its religious tenets, including the belief that sexual activity should only occur in
the context of marriage between a man and a woman. Id. at 21–23 (Alito, J., dissent-
ing).
