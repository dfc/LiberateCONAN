gion. This holding was based on the fact that 75 percent of the quali-
fying schools were church-related or religiously affiliated educa-
tional institutions, and that the assistance was available without
regard to the degree of religious activity of the schools. The materi-
als and equipment loaned were religiously neutral, but the substan-
tial assistance necessarily constituted aid to the sectarian school en-
terprise as a whole and thus had a primary effect of advancing
religion.94 Second, the provision of auxiliary services—remedial and
accelerated instruction, guidance counseling and testing, speech and
hearing services—by public employees on nonpublic school prem-
ises was invalidated because the Court found that, even though the
teachers under this program—unlike those under one of the pro-
grams struck down in Lemon v. Kurtzman—were public employees
rather than employees of the religious schools, the continuing sur-
veillance necessary to ensure that the teachers remained reli-
giously neutral gave rise to a constitutionally intolerable degree of
entanglement between church and state.95
     In two 1985 cases, the Court again struck down programs of
public subsidy of instructional services provided on the premises of
sectarian schools, and relied on the effects test as well as the en-
tanglement test. In Grand Rapids School District v. Ball,96 the Court
invalidated two programs conducted in leased private school class-
rooms, one taught during the regular school day by public school
teachers,97 and the other taught after regular school hours by part-
time “public” teachers otherwise employed as full-time teachers by
the sectarian school.98 Both programs, the Court held, had the ef-
fect of promoting religion in three distinct ways. The teachers might
be influenced by the “pervasively sectarian nature” of the environ-
ment and might “subtly or overtly indoctrinate the students in par-
ticular religious tenets at public expense”; use of the parochial school
classrooms “threatens to convey a message of state support for reli-
gion” through “the symbolic union of government and religion in

The Court in Committee for Public Educ. & Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U.S.
646, 661–62 (1980), held that Meek did not forbid all aid that benefited religiously
pervasive schools to some extent, so long as it was conferred in such a way as to
prevent any appreciable risk of being used to transmit or teach religious views. See
also Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. at 262 (Justice Powell concurring in part and dis-
senting in part).
