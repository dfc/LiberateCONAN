only on “who gets to do the publishing.” 1270 In both respects, the
tort action was analogous to patent and copyright laws in that both
provide an economic incentive to persons to make the investment
required to produce a performance of interest to the public.1271
     Publication of Legally Confidential Information.—
Although a state may have valid interests in assuring the confiden-
tiality of certain information, it may not enforce this confidentiality
by criminally prosecuting nonparticipant third parties, including the
press, who disclose or publish the information.1272 The case that made
this point arose in the context of the investigation of a state judge
by an official disciplinary body; both by state constitutional provi-
sion and by statute, the body’s proceedings were required to be con-
fidential and the statute made the divulging of information about
the proceeding a misdemeanor. For publishing an accurate report
about an investigation of a sitting judge, the newspaper was in-
dicted and convicted of violating the statute, which the state courts
construed to apply to nonparticipants. Although the Court recog-
nized the importance of confidentiality to the effectiveness of such
a proceeding, it held that the publication here “lies near the core of
the First Amendment” because the free discussion of public affairs,
including the operation of the judicial system, is primary and the
state’s interests were simply insufficient to justify the encroach-
ment on freedom of speech and of the press.1273 The scope of the
privilege thus conferred by this decision on the press and on indi-
viduals is, however, somewhat unclear, because the Court ap-
peared to reserve consideration of broader questions than those pre-
sented by the facts of the case.1274 It does appear, however, that

     1271 433 U.S. at 576–78. This discussion is the closest the Court has come in

considering how copyright laws in particular are to be reconciled with the First Amend-
ment. The Court emphasizes that copyright laws encourage the production of work
for the public’s benefit.
     1272 Landmark Communications v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978). The decision

by Chief Justice Burger was unanimous, Justices Brennan and Powell not partici-
pating, but Justice Stewart would have limited the holding to freedom of the press
to publish. Id. at 848. See also Smith v. Daily Mail Pub. Co., 443 U.S. 97 (1979).
     1273 435 U.S. at 838–42. The Court disapproved of the state court’s use of the

clear-and-present-danger test: “Mr. Justice Holmes’ test was never intended ‘to ex-
press a technical legal doctrine or to convey a formula for adjudicating cases.’ ” Id.
at 842, quoting from Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 353 (1946) (Frankfurter,
J. concurring).
     1274 Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), in the context of a

civil proceeding, had held that the First Amendment did not permit the imposition
of liability on the press for truthful publication of information released to the public
in official court records, id. at 496, but had expressly reserved the question “whether
the publication of truthful information withheld by law from the public domain is
similarly privileged,” id. at 497 n.27, and Landmark on its face appears to answer
