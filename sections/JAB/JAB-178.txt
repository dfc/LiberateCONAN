    Government as Regulator of Labor Relations.—Numerous
problems may arise in this area,926 but the issue here considered is
the balance to be drawn between the free speech rights of an em-
ployer and the statutory rights of his employees to engage or not
engage in concerted activities free of employer coercion, which may
well include threats or promises or other oral or written communi-
cations. The Court has upheld prohibitions against employer inter-
ference with union activity through speech so long as the speech is
coercive,927 and that holding has been reduced to statutory form.928
Nonetheless, there is a First Amendment tension in this area, with
its myriad variations of speech forms that may be denominated “pre-
dictions,” especially because determination whether particular ut-
terances have an impermissible impact on workers is vested with
an agency with no particular expertise in the protection of freedom
of expression.929
    Government as Investigator: Reporter’s Privilege.—News or-
ganizations have claimed that the First Amendment compels a rec-
ognition by government of an exception to the ancient rule that ev-
ery citizen owes to his government a duty to give what testimony
he is capable of giving.930 The argument for a limited exemption to
permit reporters to conceal their sources and to keep confidential
certain information they obtain and choose at least for the moment
not to publish was rejected in Branzburg v. Hayes 931 by a closely
divided Court. “Fair and effective law enforcement aimed at provid-
ing security for the person and property of the individual is a fun-
damental function of government, and the grand jury plays an im-
portant, constitutionally mandated role in this process. On the records
now before us, we perceive no basis for holding that the public in-
terest in law enforcement and in ensuring effective grand jury pro-

these obligations because if forced to respond to subpoenas and identify their sources
or disclose other confidences, their informants will refuse or be reluctant to furnish
newsworthy information in the future. This asserted burden on news gathering is
said to make compelled testimony from newsmen constitutionally suspect and to re-
quire a privileged position for them.” Id. at 682.
