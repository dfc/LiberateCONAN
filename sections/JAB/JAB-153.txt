even in the absence of any effort or intent to inform the public.783
In Rankin v. McPherson 784 the Court held protected an employee’s
comment, made to a co-worker upon hearing of an unsuccessful at-
tempt to assassinate the President, and in a context critical of the
President’s policies, “If they go for him again, I hope they get him.”
Indeed, the Court in McPherson emphasized the clerical employee’s
lack of contact with the public in concluding that the employer’s
interest in maintaining the efficient operation of the office (includ-
ing public confidence and good will) was insufficient to outweigh the
employee’s First Amendment rights.785
     In City of San Diego v. Roe,786 the Court held that a police de-
partment could fire a police officer who sold a video on the adults-
only section of eBay that showed him stripping off a police uniform
and masturbating. The Court found that the officer’s “expression does
not qualify as a matter of public concern . . . and Pickering balanc-
ing does not come into play.” 787 The Court also noted that the offi-
cer’s speech, unlike federal employees’ speech in United States v.
National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU),788 “was linked to his
official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employ-
er’s image,” and therefore “was detrimental to the mission and func-
tions of his employer.” 789 The Court, therefore, had “little difficulty
in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe
under either line of cases [i.e., Pickering or NTEU].” 790 This leaves
uncertain whether, had the officer’s expression not been linked to
his official status, the Court would have overruled his firing under
NTEU or would have upheld it under Pickering on the ground that
his expression was not a matter of public concern.
    In Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Court cut back on First Amendment
protection for government employees by holding that there is no pro-
tection—Pickering balancing is not to be applied—“when public em-
     783 This conclusion was implicit in Givhan, 439 U.S. 410 (1979), characterized

by the Court in Connick as involving “an employee speak[ing] out as a citizen on a
matter of general concern, not tied to a personal employment dispute, but . . . [speak-
ing] privately.” 461 U.S. at 148, n.8.
     784 483 U.S. 378 (1987). This was a 5–4 decision, with Justice Marshall’s opin-

ion of the Court being joined by Justices Brennan, Blackmun, Powell, and Stevens,
and with Justice Scalia’s dissent being joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by
Justices White and O’Connor. Justice Powell added a separate concurring opinion.
     785 “Where . . . an employee serves no confidential, policymaking, or public con-

tact role, the danger to the agency’s successful function from that employee’s pri-
vate speech is minimal.” 483 U.S. at 390–91.
