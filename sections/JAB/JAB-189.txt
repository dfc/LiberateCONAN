power, Congress may refuse to subsidize the exercise of First Amend-
ment rights by those recipients. The distinction between these two
closely related principles seemed, initially at least, to hinge on the
severity and pervasiveness of the restriction placed on the exercise
of rights to free speech. What has emerged more recently is the prin-
ciple that Congress may condition the receipt of federal funds on
acceptance of speech limitations on persons working for a project
receiving the federal funding—even if the project also receives non-
federal funds—provided that the speech limitations do not extend
to the use of non-federal funds outside of the federally funded proj-
ect.
     In Regan v. Taxation with Representation,984 the Court held that
Congress could constitutionally limit tax-exempt status under
§ 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to charitable organiza-
tions that do not engage in lobbying. “Congress has merely refused
to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys,” the Court con-
cluded.985 The effect of the ruling on the organization’s lobbying ac-
tivities was minimal, however, since it could continue to receive tax-
deductible contributions by creating a separate affiliate to conduct
the lobbying. In FCC v. League of Women Voters,986 by contrast, the
Court held that the First Amendment rights of public broadcasting
stations were abridged by a prohibition on all editorializing by any
recipient of public funds. There was no practical alternative means,
as there had been in Taxation with Representation, by which the
stations could continue to receive public funding and create an af-
filiate to engage in the prohibited speech. The Court rejected dis-
senting Justice Rehnquist’s argument that the subsidization prin-
ciple of Taxation with Representation should be controlling.987
     In Rust v. Sullivan, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist asserted
for the Court that restrictions on abortion counseling and referral
imposed on recipients of family planning funding under the Public
Health Service Act did not constitute discrimination on the basis of
viewpoint, but instead represented the government’s decision “to fund
one activity to the exclusion of the other.” 988 In addition, the Court
noted, the “regulations do not force the Title X grantee to give up

(1959) (exclusion of lobbying expenses from income tax deduction for ordinary and
necessary business expenses is not a regulation aimed at the suppression of danger-
ous ideas, and does not violate the First Amendment).

     988 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991). Dissenting Justice Blackmun contended that Taxa-

tion With Representation was easily distinguishable because its restriction was on
all lobbying activity regardless of content or viewpoint. Id. at 208–09.
