     First, in Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza,1435 the
Court held constitutionally protected the picketing of a store lo-
cated in a shopping center by a union objecting to the store’s em-
ployment of nonunion labor. Finding that the shopping center was
the functional equivalent of the business district involved in Marsh,
the Court announced there was “no reason why access to a busi-
ness district in a company town for the purpose of exercising First
Amendment rights should be constitutionally required, while ac-
cess for the same purpose to property functioning as a business dis-
trict should be limited simply because the property surrounding the
‘business district’ is not under the same ownership.” 1436 “[T]he State,”
said Justice Marshall, “may not delegate the power, through the use
of its trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public
wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises
in a manner and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to
which the property is actually put.” 1437 The Court observed that it
would have been hazardous to attempt to distribute literature at
the entrances to the center and it reserved for future decision “whether
respondents’ property rights could, consistently with the First Amend-
ment, justify a bar on picketing which was not thus directly re-
lated in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center prop-
erty was being put.” 1438
     Four years later, the Court answered the reserved question in
the negative.1439 Several members of an antiwar group had at-
tempted to distribute leaflets on the mall of a large shopping cen-
ter, calling on the public to attend a protest meeting. Center guards
invoked a trespass law against them, and the Court held that they
could rightfully be excluded. The center had not dedicated its prop-
erty to a public use, the Court said; rather, it had invited the pub-
lic in specifically to carry on business with those stores located in
the center. Plaintiffs’ leafleting, not directed to any store or to the
customers qua customers of any of the stores, was unrelated to any
activity in the center. Unlike the situation in Logan Valley Plaza,
there were reasonable alternatives by which plaintiffs could reach
those who used the center. Thus, in the absence of a relationship
between the purpose of the expressive activity and the business of
