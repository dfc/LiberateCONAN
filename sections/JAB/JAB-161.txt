    Governmental regulation of school and college administration
can also implicate the First Amendment. But the Court dismissed
as too attenuated a claim to a First Amendment-based academic
freedom privilege to withhold peer review materials from EEOC sub-
poena in an investigation of a charge of sex discrimination in a fac-
ulty tenure decision.827
    Government as Regulator of the Electoral Process: Elec-
tions and Referendums.—Government has increasingly regu-
lated the electoral system by which candidates are nominated and
elected, requiring disclosure of contributions and certain expendi-
tures, limiting contributions and expenditures, and imposing other
regulations.828 These regulations can restrict freedom of expression
and association, which include the rights to join together for politi-
cal purposes, to promote candidates and issues, and to participate
in the political process.829 The Court is divided with respect to the
constitutionality of many of these federal and state restrictions, but
it has been consistent in not permitting the government to bar or
penalize political speech directly. Thus, it held that the Minnesota
Supreme Court could not prohibit candidates for judicial election
from announcing their views on disputed legal and political is-
sues.830 And, when Kentucky attempted to void an election on the
ground that the winner’s campaign promise to serve at a lower sal-
ary than that affixed to the office violated a law prohibiting candi-
dates from offering material benefits to voters in consideration for
their votes, the Court ruled unanimously that the state’s action vio-
lated the First Amendment.831

    828  The basic federal legislation regulating campaign finances is spread over sev-
eral titles of the United States Code. The relevant, principal modern laws are the
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86 Stat. 3, as amended by the Federal Elec-
tion Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 1263, the Federal Election Cam-
paign Act Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1339, and the Bipartisan Campaign Re-
form Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 81, found at 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq., and sections of Titles
18 and 26. The Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, 43 Stat. 1074, was upheld in
Burroughs v. United States, 290 U.S. 534 (1934), but there was no First Amend-
ment challenge. All states, of course, extensively regulate elections.

424 U.S. 1, 14, 19 (1976); First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765,
776–78 (1978); Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U.S. 45, 52–54 (1982).

214 (1966) (setting aside a conviction and voiding a statute that punished election-
eering or solicitation of votes for or against any proposition on the day of the elec-
tion, applied to publication of a newspaper editorial on election day supporting an
issue on the ballot); Vanasco v. Schwartz, 401 F. Supp. 87 (E.D.N.Y. 1975) (three-
judge court), aff’d, 423 U.S. 1041 (1976) (statute barring malicious, scurrilous, and
false and misleading campaign literature is unconstitutionally overbroad).
