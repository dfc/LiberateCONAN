ing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.” 406 Gov-
ernment “thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for
the imposition of such a restraint.” 407 Under the English licensing
system, which expired in 1695, all printing presses and printers were
licensed and nothing could be published without prior approval of
the state or church authorities. The great struggle for liberty of the
press was for the right to publish without a license what for a long
time could be published only with a license.408
    The United States Supreme Court’s first encounter with a law
imposing a prior restraint came in Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Ol-
son,409 in which a five-to-four majority voided a law authorizing the
permanent enjoining of future violations by any newspaper or peri-
odical once found to have published or circulated an “obscene, lewd
and lascivious” or a “malicious, scandalous and defamatory” issue.
An injunction had been issued after the newspaper in question had
printed a series of articles tying local officials to gangsters. Al-
though the dissenters maintained that the injunction constituted
no prior restraint, because that doctrine applied to prohibitions of
publication without advance approval of an executive official,410 the
majority deemed it “the essence of censorship” that, in order to avoid
a contempt citation, the newspaper would have to clear future pub-
lications in advance with the judge.411 Liberty of the press to scru-
tinize closely the conduct of public affairs was essential, said Chief
Justice Hughes for the Court. “[T]he administration of government
has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and
corruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious propor-
tions, and the danger of its protection by unfaithful officials and of
the impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by
criminal alliances and official neglect, emphasizes the primary need
of a vigilant and courageous press, especially in great cities. The
fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant pur-
veyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immu-
nity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with official mis-
conduct. Subsequent punishment for such abuses as may exist is
the appropriate remedy, consistent with constitutional privi-
lege.” 412 The Court did not explore the kinds of restrictions to which
