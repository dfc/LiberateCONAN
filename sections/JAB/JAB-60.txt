to vendors of religious books and pamphlets,284 but eleven months
later it vacated the decision and struck down such fees.285 A city
ordinance making it unlawful for anyone distributing literature to
ring a doorbell or otherwise summon the dwellers of a residence to
the door to receive such literature was held to violate the First Amend-
ment when applied to distributors of leaflets advertising a religious
meeting.286 A state child labor law, however, was held to be validly
applied to punish the guardian of a nine-year old child who permit-
ted her to engage in “preaching work” and the sale of religious pub-
lications after hours.287 The Court decided a number of cases involv-
ing meetings and rallies in public parks and other public places by
upholding licensing and permit requirements which were premised
on nondiscriminatory “times, places, and manners” terms and which
did not seek to regulate the content of the religious message to be
communicated.288 In 2002, the Court struck down on free speech
grounds a town ordinance requiring door-to-door solicitors, includ-
ing persons seeking to proselytize about their faith, to register with
the town and obtain a solicitation permit.289 The Court stated that
the requirement was “offensive . . . to the very notion of a free so-
ciety.”
    Free Exercise Exemption From General Governmental Re-
quirements.—As described above, the Court gradually abandoned
its strict belief-conduct distinction, and developed a balancing test
to determine when a uniform, nondiscriminatory requirement by gov-
ernment mandating action or nonaction by citizens must allow ex-
ceptions for citizens whose religious scruples forbid compliance. Then,


this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probabilities of
excesses and abuses, these liberties are in the long view, essential to enlightened
opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.” Id. at 310.

Swaggart Ministries v. California Bd. of Equalization, 493 U.S. 378, 389 (1990), as
applying “only where a flat license fee operates as a prior restraint”; upheld in Swag-
gart was application of a general sales and use tax to sales of religious publications.
