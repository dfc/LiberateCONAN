with Wyoming the sole holdout.935 As for federal courts, Federal Rule
of Evidence 501 provides that “the privilege of a witness . . . shall
be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be
interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of rea-
son and experience.” 936 The federal courts have not resolved whether
the common law provides a journalists’ privilege.937
     Nor does the status of an entity as a newspaper (or any other
form of news medium) protect it from issuance and execution on
probable cause of a search warrant for evidence or other material
properly sought in a criminal investigation.938 The press had ar-
gued that to permit searches of newsrooms would threaten the abil-
ity to gather, analyze, and disseminate news, because searches would
be disruptive, confidential sources would be deterred from coming
forward with information because of fear of exposure, reporters would
decline to put in writing their information, and internal editorial
deliberations would be exposed. The Court thought that First Amend-
ment interests were involved, but it seemed to doubt that the con-
sequences alleged would occur, and it observed that the built-in pro-
tections of the warrant clause would adequately protect those interests
and noted that magistrates could guard against abuses when war-




     935 The 33rd state statute enacted was the State of Washington’s, which took ef-

fect on July 22, 2007. See the website of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press for information on the state laws. The greatest difficulty these laws experience
is the possibility of a constitutional conflict with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
rights of criminal defendants. See Matter of Farber, 78 N.J. 259, 394 A.2d 330, cert.
denied sub nom. New York Times v. New Jersey, 439 U.S. 997 (1978). See also New
York Times v. Jascalevich, 439 U.S. 1301, 1304, 1331 (1978) (applications to Circuit
Justices for stay), and id. at 886 (vacating stay).
     936 Rule 501 also provides that, in civil actions and proceedings brought in fed-

eral court under state law, the availability of a privilege shall be determined in ac-
cordance with state law.

Cir. 2005) (Tatel, J., concurring) (citation omitted), rehearing en banc denied, 405
F.3d 17 (D.C. Cir. 2005 (Tatel, J., concurring), cert. denied, 545 U.S. 1150 (2005),
reissued with unredacted material, 438 F.3d 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia “is not of one mind on the existence of a common
law privilege”).
     938 Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 563–67 (1978). Justice Powell thought

it appropriate that “a magistrate asked to issue a warrant for the search of press
offices can and should take cognizance of the independent values protected by the
First Amendment” when he assesses the reasonableness of a warrant in light of all
the circumstances. Id. at 568 (concurring). Justices Stewart and Marshall would have
imposed special restrictions upon searches when the press was the object, id. at 570
(dissenting), and Justice Stevens dissented on Fourth Amendment grounds. Id. at
577.
