little question that similar standards will be applied in most cases.1571
For instance, as discussed earlier, where a public employee sues a
government employer under the First Amendment’s Speech Clause,
the employee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a mat-
ter of public concern.1572 In Borough of Duryea, Pennsylvania v.
Guarnieri,1573 the Court similarly held that a police chief who al-
leged retaliation for having filed a union grievance challenging his
termination was not protected by the right to petition, because his
complaints did not go to matters of public concern.1574




     1571 See, e.g., Borough of Duryea, Pennsylvania v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. ___, No.

09–1476, slip op. at 7 (2011) (“It is not necessary to say that the [Speech and Peti-
tion] Clauses are identical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to acknowl-
edge that the rights of speech and petition share substantial common ground”); But
see id. (“Courts should not presume there is always an essential equivalence in the
[Speech and Petition] Clauses or that Speech Clause precedents necessarily and in
every case resolve Petition Clause claims”).
     1572 Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983).
     1573 564 U.S. ___, No. 09–1476, slip op. (2011).
     1574 Justice Scalia, in dissent, disputed the majority’s suggestion that a petition

need be of “public concern” to be protected, noting that the Petition Clause had his-
torically been a route for seeking relief of private concerns. Slip op. at 5–7 (2011)
(Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Scalia also suggested that the Clause should be lim-
ited to petitions directed to an executive branch or legislature, and that grievances
submitted to an adjuciatory body are not so protected. Id. at 1–3.
