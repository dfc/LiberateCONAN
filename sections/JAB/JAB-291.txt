treatment of the flag that the actor knew would seriously offend
other persons. This emphasis on causing offense to others meant
that the law was not “unrelated to the suppression of free expres-
sion” and that consequently the deferential standard of United States
v. O’Brien was inapplicable. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court ruled
that the state’s prosecution of someone who burned a flag at a po-
litical protest was not justified under the state’s asserted interest
in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity.
The Court’s opinion left little doubt that the existing federal stat-
ute, 18 U.S.C. § 700, and the flag desecration laws of 47 other states
would suffer a similar fate in a similar case. Doubt remained, how-
ever, as to whether the Court would uphold a “content-neutral” stat-
ute protecting the physical integrity of the flag.
     Immediately following Johnson, Congress enacted a new flag pro-
tection statute providing punishment for anyone who “knowingly mu-
tilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or
ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States.” 1547 The
law was designed to be content-neutral and to protect the “physical
integrity” of the flag.1548 Nonetheless, in overturning convictions of
flag burners, the Court found that the law suffered from “the same
fundamental flaw” as the Texas law in Johnson. The government’s
underlying interest, characterized by the Court as resting upon “a
perceived need to preserve the flag’s status as a symbol of our Na-
tion and certain national ideals,” 1549 still related to the suppres-
sion of free expression. Support for this interpretation was found
in the fact that most of the prohibited acts are usually associated
with disrespectful treatment of the flag; this suggested to the Court
“a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag’s symbolic value.” 1550
As in Johnson, such a law could not withstand “most exacting scru-
tiny” analysis.
     The Court’s ruling in Eichman rekindled congressional efforts,
postponed with enactment of the Flag Protection Act, to amend the
Constitution to authorize flag desecration legislation at the federal
and state levels. In both the House and the Senate these measures
failed to receive the necessary two-thirds vote.1551
