down a city’s prohibition on distribution of “commercial handbills”
through freestanding newsracks located on city property. The city’s
aesthetic interest in reducing visual clutter was furthered by reduc-
ing the total number of newsracks, but the distinction between pro-
hibited “commercial” publications and permitted “newspapers” bore
“no relationship whatsoever” to this legitimate interest.1045 The city
could not, the Court ruled, single out commercial speech to bear
the full onus when “all newsracks, regardless of whether they con-
tain commercial or noncommercial publications, are equally at
fault.” 1046 By contrast, the Court upheld a federal law that prohib-
ited broadcast of lottery advertisements by a broadcaster in a state
that prohibits lotteries, while allowing broadcast of such ads by sta-
tions in states that sponsor lotteries. There was a “reasonable fit”
between the restriction and the asserted federal interest in support-
ing state anti-gambling policies without unduly interfering with poli-
cies of neighboring states that promote lotteries.1047 The prohibi-
tion “directly served” the congressional interest, and could be applied
to a broadcaster whose principal audience was in an adjoining lot-
tery state, and who sought to run ads for that state’s lottery.1048
    In 1999, the Court struck down a provision of the same statute
as applied to advertisements for private casino gambling that are
broadcast by radio and television stations located in a state where
such gambling is legal.1049 The Court emphasized the interrelated-
ness of the four parts of the Central Hudson test: “Each [part] raises
a relevant question that may not be dispositive to the First Amend-
ment inquiry, but the answer to which may inform a judgment con-
cerning the other three.” 1050 For example, although the govern-
ment has a substantial interest in reducing the social costs of gambling,
the fact that the Congress has simultaneously encouraged gam-
bling, because of its economic benefits, makes it more difficult for
the government to demonstrate that its restriction on commercial
speech materially advances its asserted interest and constitutes a
reasonable “fit.” 1051 In this case, “[t]he operation of [18 U.S.C.] § 1304
and its attendant regulatory regime is so pierced by exemptions and
inconsistencies that the Government cannot hope to exonerate it.” 1052

    1046  507 U.S. at 426. The Court also noted the “minute” effect of removing 62
“commercial” newsracks while 1,500 to 2,000 other newsracks remained in place.
