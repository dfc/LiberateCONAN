nam War 417 and, although the Court rejected the effort, at least
five and perhaps six Justices concurred on principle that, in some
circumstances, prior restraint of publication would be constitu-
tional.418 But no cohesive doctrine relating to the subject, its appli-
cations, and its exceptions has emerged.
    The Supreme Court has written that “[t]he special vice of a prior
restraint is that communication will be suppressed . . . before an
adequate determination that it is unprotected by the First Amend-
ment.” 419 The prohibition on prior restraint, thus, is essentially a
limitation on restraints until a final judicial determination that the
restricted speech is not protected by the First Amendment. It is a
limitation, for example, against temporary restraining orders and
preliminary injunctions pending final judgment, not against perma-
nent injunctions after a final judgment is made that the restricted
speech is not protected by the First Amendment.420
    The Supreme Court has also written “that traditional prior re-
straint doctrine may not apply to [commercial speech],” 421 and “[t]he
vast majority of [federal] circuits . . . do not apply the doctrine of
     417 New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971). The vote was

6-to-3, with Justices Black, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, and Marshall in the
majority and Chief Justice Burger and Justices Harlan and Blackmun in the minor-
ity. Each Justice issued an opinion.
     418 The three dissenters thought such restraint appropriate in this case. Id. at

748, 752, 759. Justice Stewart thought restraint would be proper if disclosure “will
surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our Nation or its people,”
id. at 730, while Justice White did not endorse any specific phrasing of a standard.
Id. at 730–33. Justice Brennan would preclude even interim restraint except upon
“governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and
immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling the safety of a
transport already at sea.” Id. at 712–13.
     The same issues were raised in United States v. Progressive, Inc., 467 F. Supp.
990 (W.D. Wis. 1979), in which the United States obtained an injunction prohibiting
publication of an article it claimed would reveal information about nuclear weap-
ons, thereby increasing the dangers of nuclear proliferation. The injunction was lifted
when the same information was published elsewhere and thus there was no appel-
late review of the order.

lationships, see Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507 (1980); Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. v.

(1980) (“the burden of supporting an injunction against a future exhibition [of alleg-
edly obscene motion pictures] is even heavier than the burden of justifying the im-
position of a criminal sanction for a past communication”).
