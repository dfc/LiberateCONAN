prevent deception.1065 But even truthful, non-misleading commer-
cial speech may be regulated, and the validity of such regulation is
tested by application of the remaining prongs of the Central Hud-
son test. The test itself does not make further distinctions based
on the content of the commercial message or the nature of the gov-
ernmental interest (that interest need only be “substantial”). Re-
cent decisions suggest, however, that further distinctions may ex-
ist. Measures aimed at preserving “a fair bargaining process” between
consumer and advertiser 1066 may be more likely to pass the test 1067
than are regulations designed to implement general health, safety,
or moral concerns.1068 As the governmental interest becomes fur-
ther removed from protecting a fair bargaining process, it may be-
come more difficult to establish the absence of less burdensome regu-
latory alternatives and the presence of a “reasonable fit” between
the commercial speech restriction and the governmental inter-
est.1069

     1065 Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 383–84 (1977); Ohralik v. Ohio

State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978). Requirements that advertisers disclose
more information than they otherwise choose to are upheld “as long as [they] are
reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers,” the
Court explaining that “[t]he right of a commercial speaker not to divulge accurate
information regarding his services is not . . . a fundamental right” requiring strict
scrutiny of the disclosure requirement. Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,
471 U.S. 626, 651 & n.14 (1985) (upholding requirement that attorney’s contingent
fees ad mention that unsuccessful plaintiffs might still be liable for court costs).
     1066 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501 (1996).
     1067 See, e.g., Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 465 (1978) (uphold-

ing ban on in-person solicitation by attorneys due in part to the “potential for over-
reaching” when a trained advocate “solicits an unsophisticated, injured, or dis-
tressed lay person”).
     1068 Compare United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418 (1993) (up-

holding federal law supporting state interest in protecting citizens from lottery infor-
mation) and Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 631 (1995) (upholding a
30-day ban on targeted, direct-mail solicitation of accident victims by attorneys, not
because of any presumed susceptibility to overreaching, but because the ban “fore-
stall[s] the outrage and irritation with the . . . legal profession that the [banned]
solicitation . . . has engendered”) with Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476
(1995) (striking down federal statute prohibiting display of alcohol content on beer
labels) and 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996) (striking down
state law prohibiting display of retail prices in ads for alcoholic beverages).
     1069 “[S]everal Members of the Court have expressed doubts about the Central

Hudson analysis and whether it should apply in particular cases.” Thompson v. West-
ern States Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 367 (2002). Justice Stevens has criticized
the Central Hudson test because it seemingly allows regulation of any speech pro-
pounded in a commercial context regardless of the content of that speech. “[A]ny
description of commercial speech that is intended to identify the category of speech
entitled to less First Amendment protection should relate to the reasons for permit-
ting broader regulation: namely, commercial speech’s potential to mislead.” Rubin v.
Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 494 (1995) (concurring opinion). The Justice re-
peated these views in 1996: “when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of
truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preserva-
tion of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous
