disabled from removing library books in order to deny access to ideas
with which it disagrees for political reasons.814 The four dissenters
rejected the contention that school children have a right to receive
information and ideas and thought that the proper role of educa-
tion was to inculcate the community’s values, a function into which
the federal courts could rarely intrude.815 The decision provides little
guidance to school officials and to the lower courts and may neces-
sitate a revisiting of the controversy by the Supreme Court.
     The Court distinguished Tinker in Hazelwood School District v.
Kuhlmeier,816 in which it relied on public forum analysis to hold
that editorial control and censorship of a student newspaper spon-
sored by a public high school need be only “reasonably related to
legitimate pedagogical concerns.” 817 “The question whether the First
Amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student speech—
the question that we addressed in Tinker—is different from the ques-
tion whether the First Amendment requires a school affirmatively
to promote particular student speech.” 818 The student newspaper
had been created by school officials as a part of the school curricu-
lum, and served “as a supervised learning experience for journal-
ism students.” 819 Because no public forum had been created, school
officials could maintain editorial control subject only to a reasonable-
ness standard. Thus, a principal’s decision to excise from the publi-
cation an article describing student pregnancy in a manner be-
lieved inappropriate for younger students, and another article on
divorce critical of a named parent, were upheld.
    The category of school-sponsored speech subject to Kuhlmeier
analysis appears to be far broader than the category of student ex-
pression still governed by Tinker. School-sponsored activities, the
Court indicated, can include “publications, theatrical productions,
and other expressive activities that students, parents, and mem-
bers of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprima-
tur of the school. These activities may fairly be characterized as
part of the school curriculum, whether or not they occur in a tradi-
tional classroom setting, so long as they are supervised by faculty
members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to
