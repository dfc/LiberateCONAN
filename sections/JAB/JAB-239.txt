    Emotional Distress Tort Actions.—In Hustler Magazine, Inc.
v. Falwell,1260 the Court applied the New York Times v. Sullivan
standard to recovery of damages by public officials and public fig-
ures for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The
case involved an advertisement “parody” portraying the plaintiff, de-
scribed by the Court as a “nationally known minister who has been
active as a commentator on politics and public affairs,” as stating
that he lost his virginity “during a drunken incestuous rendezvous
with his mother in an outhouse.” 1261 Affirming liability in this case,
the Court believed, would subject “political cartoonists and sati-
rists . . . to damage awards without any showing that their work
falsely defamed its subject.” 1262 A proffered “outrageousness” stan-
dard for distinguishing such parodies from more traditional politi-
cal cartoons was rejected; although not doubting that “the carica-
ture of respondent . . . is at best a distant cousin of [some] political
cartoons . . . and a rather poor relation at that,” the Court ex-
plained that “ ‘[o]utrageousness’ in the area of political and social
discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would al-
low a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors’ tastes or
views. . . .” 1263 Therefore, proof of intent to cause injury, “the gra-
vamen of the tort,” is insufficient “in the area of public debate about
public figures.” Additional proof that the publication contained a false
statement of fact made with actual malice was necessary, the Court
concluded, in order “to give adequate ‘breathing space’ to the free-
doms protected by the First Amendment.” 1264
    The Court next considered whether an intentional infliction of
emotional distress action could be brought by a father against pub-
lic protestors who picketed the military funeral of his son, where
the plaintiff was neither a public official nor a public figure. Based
on the reasoning of Hustler Magazine, one might presume that the

     1259 The Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989). The Court left open the ques-

tion “whether, in cases where information has been acquired unlawfully by a news-
paper or by a source, the government may ever punish not only the unlawful acqui-
sition, but the ensuing publication as well.” Id. at 535 n.8 (emphasis in original). In
Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001), the Court held that a content-neutral stat-
ute prohibiting the publication of illegally intercepted communications (in this case
a cell phone conversation) violates free speech where the person who publishes the
material did not participate in the interception, and the communication concerns a
public issue.
