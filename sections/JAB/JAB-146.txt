formerly the Civil Service Commission, the Act prevents employees
from running for public office, distributing campaign literature, play-
ing an active role at political meetings, circulating nomination peti-
tions, attending a political convention except as a spectator, publish-
ing a letter soliciting votes for a candidate, and all similar activity.749
The question is whether government, which may not prohibit citi-
zens in general from engaging in these activities, may nonetheless
so control the off-duty activities of its own employees.
     In United Public Workers v. Mitchell,750 the Court answered in
the affirmative. While the Court refused to consider the claims of
persons who had not yet engaged in forbidden political activities, it
ruled against a mechanical employee of the Mint who had done so.
The Court’s opinion, by Justice Reed, recognized that the restric-
tions of political activities imposed by the Act did in some measure
impair First Amendment and other constitutional rights,751 but it
based its decision upon the established principle that no right is
absolute. The standard by which the Court judged the validity of
the permissible impairment of First Amendment rights was a due
process standard of reasonableness.752 Thus, changes in the stan-
dards of judging incidental restrictions on expression suggested the
possibility of a reconsideration of Mitchell.753 In Civil Service Com-
mission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, however, a di-
vided Court, reaffirming Mitchell, sustained the Act’s limitations upon
political activity against a range of First Amendment challenges.754
The Court emphasized that the interest of the government in for-
bidding partisan political activities by its employees was so substan-
tial that it overrode the rights of those employees to engage in po-
litical activities and association; 755 therefore, a statute that barred

refused to consider overbreadth attacks on a state statute of much greater coverage
because the plaintiffs had engaged in conduct that the statute clearly could constitu-
tionally proscribe.
     755 The interests the Court recognized as served by the proscription on partisan

activities were (1) the interest in the efficient and fair operation of governmental
activities and the appearance of such operation, (2) the interest in fair elections,
and (3) the interest in protecting employees from improper political influences. 413
