Sabbatarians in common with Sunday worshippers reflects nothing
more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face of
religious differences, and does not represent that involvement of re-
ligious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Estab-
lishment Clause to forestall.” 257 Legislation granting religious ex-
emptions not held to have been required by the Free Exercise Clause
has been upheld against Establishment Clause challenge,258 al-
though it is also possible for legislation to go too far in promoting
free exercise.259 Government need not, however, offer the same ac-
commodations to secular entities that it extends to religious practi-
tioners in order to facilitate their religious exercise; “[r]eligious ac-
commodations . . . need not ‘come packaged with benefits to secular
entities.’ ” 260
     “Play in the joints” can work both ways, the Court ruled in up-
holding a state’s exclusion of theology students from a college schol-
     257 Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 409 (1963). Accord, Thomas v. Review Bd.,

450 U.S. 707, 719–20 (1981). Dissenting in Thomas, Justice Rehnquist argued that
Sherbert and Thomas created unacceptable tensions between the Establishment and
Free Exercise Clauses, and that requiring the states to accommodate persons like
Sherbert and Thomas because of their religious beliefs ran the risk of “establishing”
religion under the Court’s existing tests. He argued further, however, that less ex-
pansive interpretations of both clauses would eliminate this artificial tension. Thus,
Justice Rehnquist would have interpreted the Free Exercise Clause as not requiring
government to grant exemptions from general requirements that may burden reli-
gious exercise but that do not prohibit religious practices outright, and would have
interpreted the Establishment Clause as not preventing government from volun-
tarily granting religious exemptions. 450 U.S. at 720–27. By 1990 these views had
apparently gained ascendancy, Justice Scalia’s opinion for the Court in the “peyote”
case suggesting that accommodation should be left to the political process, i.e., that
states could constitutionally provide exceptions in their drug laws for sacramental
peyote use, even though such exceptions are not constitutionally required. Employ-
ment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 890 (1990).

institutionalized person unless the burden furthers a “compelling governmental in-
