ever, the Court upheld a ban on residential picketing in Frisby v.
Shultz,1464 finding that the city ordinance was narrowly tailored to
serve the “significant” governmental interest in protecting residen-
tial privacy. As interpreted, the ordinance banned only picketing that
targeted a single residence, and it is unclear whether the Court would
uphold a broader restriction on residential picketing.1465
     In 1982, the Justices confronted a case, that, like Hughes v. Su-
perior Court,1466 involved a state court injunction on picketing, al-
though this one also involved a damage award. NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co.1467 may join in terms of importance such cases as
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan 1468 in requiring the states to ob-
serve enhanced constitutional standards before they may impose li-
ability upon persons for engaging in expressive conduct that impli-
cates the First Amendment. The case arose in the context of a protest
against racial conditions by black citizens of Claiborne County, Mis-
sissippi. Listing demands that included desegregation of public fa-
cilities, hiring of black policemen, hiring of more black employees
by local stores, and ending of verbal abuse by police, a group of
several hundred blacks unanimously voted to boycott the area’s white
merchants. The boycott was carried out through speeches and non-
violent picketing and solicitation of others to cease doing business
with the merchants. Individuals were designated to watch stores
and identify blacks patronizing the stores; their names were then
announced at meetings and published. Persuasion of others in-
cluded social pressures and threats of social ostracism. Acts of vio-
lence did occur from time to time, directed in the main at blacks
who did not observe the boycott.
    The state Supreme Court imposed joint and several liability upon
leaders and participants in the boycott, and upon the NAACP, for
all of the merchants’ lost earnings during a seven-year period on
the basis of the common law tort of malicious interference with the
merchants’ business, holding that the existence of acts of physical
force and violence and the use of force, violence, and threats to achieve
the ends of the boycott deprived it of any First Amendment protec-
tion.
   Reversing, the Court observed that the goals of the boycotters
were legal and that most of their means were constitutionally pro-

    1465 An earlier case involving residential picketing had been resolved on equal
protection rather than First Amendment grounds, the ordinance at issue making an
exception for labor picketing. Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980).
    1466 339 U.S. 460 (1950).
    1467 458 U.S. 886 (1982).
    1468 376 U.S. 254 (1964).
