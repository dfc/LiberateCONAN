spect to specific matters still in judicial suspense, quite an-
other. . . . A publication intended to teach the judge a lesson, or to
vent spleen, or to discredit him, or to influence him in his future
conduct, would not justify exercise of the contempt power. . . . It
must refer to a matter under consideration and constitute in effect
a threat to its impartial disposition. It must be calculated to create
an atmospheric pressure incompatible with rational, impartial ad-
judication. But to interfere with justice it need not succeed. As with
other offenses, the state should be able to proscribe attempts that
fail because of the danger that attempts may succeed.” 473
     A unanimous Court next struck down the contempt conviction
arising out of newspaper criticism of judicial action already taken,
although one case was pending after a second indictment. Specifi-
cally alluding to clear and present danger, while seeming to regard
it as stringent a test as Justice Black had in the prior case, Justice
Reed wrote that the danger sought to be averted, a “threat to the
impartial and orderly administration of justice,” “has not the clear-
ness and immediacy necessary to close the door of permissible pub-
lic comment.” 474 Divided again, the Court a year later set aside con-
tempt convictions based on publication, while a motion for a new
trial was pending, of inaccurate and unfair accounts and an edito-
rial concerning the trial of a civil case. “The vehemence of the lan-
guage used is not alone the measure of the power to punish for con-
tempt. The fires which it kindles must constitute an imminent, and
not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The dan-
ger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately im-
peril.” 475
    In Wood v. Georgia,476 the Court again divided, applying clear
and present danger to upset the contempt conviction of a sheriff
who had been cited for criticizing the recommendation of a county
court that a grand jury look into African-American bloc voting, vote
buying, and other alleged election irregularities. No showing had
been made, said Chief Justice Warren, of “a substantive evil actu-

    474  Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 336, 350 (1946). To Justice Frank-
furter, the decisive consideration was whether the judge or jury is, or presently will
be, pondering a decision that comment seeks to affect. Id. at 369.
     475 Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 376 (1947). Dissenting with Chief Justice Vinson,

Justice Frankfurter said: “We cannot say that the Texas Court could not properly
find that these newspapers asked of the judge, and instigated powerful sections of
the community to ask of the judge, that which no one has any business to ask of a
judge, except the parties and their counsel in open court, namely, that he should
decide one way rather than another.” Id. at 390. Justice Jackson also dissented. Id.
at 394. See also Landmark Communications v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 844 (1978);
