the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is
directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely
to incite or produce such action.” 381 This development and its myriad
applications are elaborated in the following sections.
    The First Amendment by its terms applies only to laws enacted
by Congress, and not to the actions of private persons.382 This leads
to a “state action” (or “governmental action”) limitation similar to
that applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment.383 The limitation has
seldom been litigated in the First Amendment context, but there is
no obvious reason why analysis should differ markedly from Four-
teenth Amendment state action analysis. Both contexts require “cau-
tious analysis of the quality and degree of Government relation-
ship to the particular acts in question.” 384 In holding that the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) is a governmental entity
for purposes of the First Amendment, the Court declared that “[t]he
Constitution constrains governmental action ‘by whatever instru-
ments or in whatever modes that action may be taken’ . . . [a]nd
under whatever congressional label.” 385 The relationship of the gov-
ernment to broadcast licensees affords other opportunities to ex-
plore the breadth of “governmental action.” 386

    382  Through interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the prohibition ex-
tends to the states as well. See discussion on incorporation under Fourteenth Amend-
ment, infra. Of course, the First Amendment also applies to the non-legislative branches
of government—to every “government agency—local, state, or federal.” Herbert v.
Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 168 n.16 (1979).

Justice Burger).

Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346–47 (1880)). The Court refused to be bound by
the statement in Amtrak’s authorizing statute that the corporation is “not . . . an
agency or establishment of the United States Government.” This assertion can be
effective only “for purposes of matters that are within Congress’s control,” the Court
explained. “[I]t is not for Congress to make the final determination of Amtrak’s sta-
tus as a Government entity for purposes of determining the constitutional rights of
citizens affected by its actions.” 513 U.S. at 392.
     386 In CBS v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 412 U.S. 94 (1973), the Court held that

a broadcast licensee could refuse to carry a paid editorial advertisement. Chief Jus-
tice Burger, joined only by Justices Stewart and Rehnquist in that portion of his
opinion, reasoned that a licensee’s refusal to accept such an ad did not constitute
“governmental action” for purposes of the First Amendment. “The First Amendment
does not reach acts of private parties in every instance where the Congress or the
[Federal Communications] Commission has merely permitted or failed to prohibit
such acts.” Id. at 119.
