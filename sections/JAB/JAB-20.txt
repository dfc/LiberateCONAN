filiated colleges, hospitals, and social services providers; and as a
consequence it has found direct aid programs to such entities to be
permissible.79
     In its most recent decisions the Court has modified both the pri-
mary effect and excessive entanglement prongs of the Lemon test
as they apply to aid programs directly benefiting sectarian elemen-
tary and secondary schools; and in so doing it has overturned sev-
eral prior decisions imposing tight constraints on aid to perva-
sively sectarian institutions. In Agostini v. Felton 80 the Court, in a
5–4 decision, abandoned the presumptions that public school teach-
ers giving instruction on the premises of sectarian elementary and
secondary schools will be so affected by the religiosity of the envi-
ronment that they will inculcate religion and that, consequently, an
excessively entangling monitoring of their services is constitution-
ally necessary. In Mitchell v. Helms,81 in turn, the Court aban-
doned the presumptions that such schools are so pervasively sectar-
ian that their secular educational functions cannot be differentiated
from their religious educational functions and that direct aid to their
educational functions, consequently, violates the Establishment Clause.
In reaching these conclusions and upholding the aid programs in
question, the Court overturned its prior decision in Aguilar v. Felton 82
and parts of its decisions in Meek v. Pittenger,83 Wolman v. Wal-
ter,84 and Grand Rapids School District v. Ball.85
    Thus, the Court’s jurisprudence concerning public aid to sectar-
ian organizations has evolved, particularly as it concerns public aid
to sectarian elementary and secondary schools. That evolution has
given some uncertainty to the rules that apply to any given form of
aid; and in both Agostini v. Felton 86 and Mitchell v. Helms 87 the
Court left open the possibility of a further evolution in its think-
ing. Nonetheless, the cases give substantial guidance.
