    Similarly, California could not prohibit official governing bodies
of political parties from endorsing or opposing candidates in pri-
mary elections.832 Minnesota, however, could prohibit a candidate
from appearing on the ballot as the candidate of more than one
party.833 The Court wrote that election “[r]egulations imposing se-
vere burdens on plaintiffs’ [associational] rights must be narrowly
tailored and advance a compelling state interest. Lesser burdens,
however, trigger less exacting review, and a State’s important regu-
latory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable nondis-
criminatory restrictions.” 834 Minnesota’s ban on “fusion” candi-
dates was not severe, as a party that could not place another party’s
candidate on the ballot was free to communicate its preference for
that candidate by other means, and the ban served “valid state in-
terests in ballot integrity and political stability.” 835
     In the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended in
1974, Congress imposed new and stringent regulation of and limi-
tations on contributions to and expenditures by political cam-
paigns, as well as disclosure of most contributions and expendi-
tures, setting the stage for the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo.836
Acting in basic unanimity, the Court sustained the contribution and
disclosure sections of the statute (although several Justices felt that
the sustained provisions trenched on protected expression), but voided
the limitations on expenditures.837 Although “contribution and ex-
penditure limitations both implicate fundamental First Amend-
ment interests,” the Court found, “expenditure ceilings impose sig-
nificantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political
expression and association than do . . . limitations on financial con-
tributions.” 838
    As to contribution limitations, the Court in Buckley recognized
that political contributions “serve[ ] to affiliate a person with a can-
didate” and “enable[ ] like-minded persons to pool their resources
in furtherance of common political goals.” Contribution ceilings, there-
fore, “limit one important means of associating with a candidate or
