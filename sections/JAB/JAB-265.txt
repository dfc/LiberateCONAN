must serve a significant governmental interest,1402 and must leave
open ample alternative channels for communication of the informa-
tion.1403 The Court has written that a time, place, or manner regu-
lation “must be narrowly tailored to serve the government’s legiti-
mate, content-neutral interests but that it need not be the least
restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so. Rather, the require-
ment of narrow tailoring is satisfied . . . [s]o long as the means cho-
sen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the gov-
ernment’s interest . . . .” 1404 A content-neutral time, place, and manner
regulation of the use of a public forum must also “contain adequate
standards to guide the official’s decision and render it subject to ef-
fective judicial review.” 1405 Unlike a content-based licensing scheme,
however, it need not “adhere to the procedural requirements set forth
in Freedman.” 1406 These requirements include that the “burden of
proving that the film [or other speech] is unprotected expression
must rest on the censor,” and that the censor must, “within a speci-
fied brief period, either issue a license or go to court to restrain
showing the film. Any restraint imposed in advance of a final judi-
cial determination on the merits must similarly be limited to pres-
ervation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible
with sound judicial resolution.” 1407
    A corollary to the rule forbidding regulation based on content
is the principle—a merging of free expression and equal protection
standards—that government may not discriminate between differ-
ent kinds of messages in affording access.1408 In order to ensure against

that constituted fighting words that insult on the basis of some factors, such as race,
but not on the basis of other factors). These principles apply only to the traditional
public forum and to the governmentally created “limited public forum.” Government
may, without creating a limited public forum, place “reasonable” restrictions on ac-
