poses to which the employee objects”; 653 an advance reduction of
dues corrects the problem only if accompanied by sufficient informa-
tion by which employees may gauge the propriety of the union’s fee.654
Therefore, the union procedure must also “provide for a reasonably
prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker.” 655
    In Davenport v. Washington Education Ass’n,656 the Court noted
that, although Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson had “set forth vari-
ous procedural requirements that public-sector unions collecting agency
fees must observe in order to ensure that an objecting nonmember
can prevent the use of his fees for impermissible purposes,” 657 it
“never suggested that the First Amendment is implicated when-
ever governments place limitations on a union’s entitlement to agency
fees above and beyond what Abood and Hudson require. To the con-
trary, we have described Hudson as ‘outlin[ing] a minimum set of
procedures by which a [public-sector] union in an agency-shop rela-
tionship could meet its requirements under Abood.’ ” 658 Thus, the
Court held in Davenport that the State of Washington could pro-
hibit “expenditure of a nonmember’s agency fees for election-
related purposes unless the nonmember affirmatively consents.” 659
The Court added that “Washington could have gone much further,
restricting public-sector agency fees to the portion of union dues de-
voted to collective bargaining. Indeed, it is uncontested that it would
be constitutional for Washington to eliminate agency fees en-
tirely.” 660
    And then, in Knox v. Service Employees International Union,661
the Court suggested constitutional limits on a public union assess-
ing political fees in an agency shop other than through a voluntary
opt in system. The union in Knox had proposed and implemented a
special fee to fund political advocacy before providing formal notice
with an opportunity for non-union employees to opt out. Five Jus-
tices characterized agency shop arrangements in the public sector
as constitutionally problematic in the first place, and, then, charged
that requiring non-union members to affirmatively opt out of con-
tributing to political activities was “a remarkable boon for unions.”
