based restraints on expression.1135 Moreover, the Court has empha-
sized numerous times the role of the First Amendment in facilitat-
ing, indeed in making possible, political dialogue and the operation
of democratic institutions.1136 Although this emphasis may be read
as premised on a hierarchical theory of the worthiness of political
speech over other forms of speech, it is more likely merely a celebra-
tion of the importance of political speech, and not a suggestion that
other kinds of speech enjoy less protection under the First Amend-
ment.1137
    If a category of speech is protected under the First Amend-
ment, then it cannot be restricted on the basis of its level of “outra-
geousness.” In Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,1138 the Court re-
fused to recognize a distinction between permissible political satire
and “outrageous” parodies that are “doubtless gross and repugnant
in the eyes of most.” 1139 “If it were possible by laying down a prin-
cipled standard to separate the one from the other,” the Court sug-
gested, “public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm.
But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite
sure that the pejorative description ‘outrageous’ does not supply
one.” 1140 Falwell can also be read as consistent with the hierarchi-
cal theory of interpretation; the offensive advertisement parody was
protected as within “the world of debate about public affairs,” and
was not “governed by any exception to . . . general First Amend-
ment principles.” 1141
   Even if a category of speech is unprotected by the First Amend-
ment, regulation on the basis of its content may be impermissible.

he lost his virginity “during a drunken incestuous rendevous with his mother in an
