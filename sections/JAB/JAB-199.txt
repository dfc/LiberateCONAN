is the First Amendment concern and if an advertisement does not
accurately inform the public about lawful activity, it can be sup-
pressed.1037
    Second, if the speech is protected, the interest of the govern-
ment in regulating and limiting it must be assessed. The state must
assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on com-
mercial speech.1038
    Third, the restriction cannot be sustained if it provides only in-
effective or remote support for the asserted purpose.1039 Instead, the
regulation must “directly advance” the governmental interest. The




     1037 Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 563, 564 (1980).

Within this category fall the cases involving the possibility of deception through such
devices as use of trade names, Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1 (1979), and solicita-
tion of business by lawyers, Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447 (1978), as
well as the proposal of an unlawful transaction, Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Commission
on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376 (1973).
     1038 Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 564, 568–69 (1980).

The Court deemed the state’s interests to be clear and substantial. The pattern here
is similar to much due process and equal protection litigation as well as expression
and religion cases in which the Court accepts the proffered interests as legitimate
and worthy. See also San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic
Comm., 483 U.S. 522 (1987) (governmental interest in protecting USOC’s exclusive
use of word “Olympic” is substantial); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476
(1995) (government’s interest in curbing strength wars among brewers is substan-
tial, but interest in facilitating state regulation of alcohol is not substantial). Con-
trast United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418 (1993), finding a substan-
tial federal interest in facilitating state restrictions on lotteries. “Unlike the situation
in Edge Broadcasting,” the Coors Court explained, “the policies of some states do
not prevent neighboring states from pursuing their own alcohol-related policies within
their respective borders.” 514 U.S. at 486. However, in Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prod-
ucts Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), the Court deemed insubstantial a governmental in-
terest in protecting postal patrons from offensive but not obscene materials. For def-
erential treatment of the governmental interest, see Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328 (1986) (Puerto Rico’s “substantial” inter-
est in discouraging casino gambling by residents justifies ban on ads aimed at resi-
dents even though residents may legally engage in casino gambling, and even though
ads aimed at tourists are permitted).
     1039 447 U.S. at 569. The ban here was found to directly advance one of the

proffered interests. Contrast this holding with Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433
U.S. 350 (1977); Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Coun-
cil, 425 U.S. 748 (1976); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983);
Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995) (prohibition on display of alcohol
content on beer labels does not directly and materially advance government’s inter-
est in curbing strength wars among brewers, given the inconsistencies and “overall
irrationality” of the regulatory scheme); and Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761 (1993)
(Florida’s ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants does not di-
rectly advance its legitimate interests in protecting consumers from fraud, protect-
ing consumer privacy, and maintaining professional independence from clients), where
the restraints were deemed indirect or ineffectual.
