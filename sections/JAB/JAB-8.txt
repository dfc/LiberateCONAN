and neutral law of general applicability.’ ” On the Establishment Clause
the Court has not wholly repudiated its previous holdings, but re-
cent decisions have evidenced a greater sympathy for the view that
the clause bars “preferential” governmental promotion of some reli-
gions but allows governmental promotion of all religion in gen-
eral.14 Nonetheless, the Court remains sharply split on how to in-
terpret both clauses.
    Court Tests Applied to Legislation Affecting Religion.—
Before considering in detail the development of the two religion clauses
by the Supreme Court, one should notice briefly the tests the Court
has articulated to adjudicate the religion cases. At the same time it
should be emphasized that the Court has noted that the language
of earlier cases “may have [contained] too sweeping utterances on
aspects of these clauses that seemed clear in relation to the particu-
lar cases but have limited meaning as general principles.” 15 While
later cases have relied on a series of well-defined, if difficult-to-
apply, tests, the Court has cautioned that “the purpose [of the reli-
gion clauses] was to state an objective, not to write a statute.” 16
     In 1802, President Jefferson wrote a letter to a group of Bap-
tists in Danbury, Connecticut, in which he declared that it was the
purpose of the First Amendment to build “a wall of separation be-
tween Church and State.” 17 In Reynolds v. United States,18 Chief
Justice Waite for the Court characterized the phrase as “almost an
authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amend-
ment.” In its first encounters with religion-based challenges to state
programs, the Court looked to Jefferson’s metaphor for substantial
guidance.19 But a metaphor may obscure as well as illuminate, and
the Court soon began to emphasize neutrality and voluntarism as

     14 See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997); Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793

(2000); and Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002). The fullest critique of
the Court’s broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause was given by then-
Justice Rehnquist in dissent in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 91 (1985).

lum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 211, 212 (1948); cf. Zorach v. Clauson, 343
U.S. 306, 317 (1952) (Justice Black dissenting). In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 614 (1971), Chief Justice Burger remarked that “the line of separation, far from
being a ‘wall,’ is a blurred, indistinct and variable barrier depending on all the cir-
cumstances of a particular relationship.” In his opinion for the Court, the Chief Jus-
tice repeated similar observations in Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984)
(the metaphor is not “wholly accurate”; the Constitution does not “require complete
separation of church and state [but] affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely
tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any”).
