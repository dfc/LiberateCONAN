tion on speech “in the last analysis is little, if any, different from
the standard applied to time, place, or manner restrictions,” 536 and
that “the validity of time, place, or manner restrictions is deter-
mined under standards very similar to those applicable in the com-
mercial speech context.” 537
    In addition, the Supreme Court generally requires—even when
applying less than strict scrutiny—that, “[w]hen the government de-
fends a regulation on speech as a means to redress past harms or
prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply ‘posit the
existence of the disease sought to be cured.’ . . . It must demon-
strate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and
that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct
and material way.” 538 The Court has held, however, that to sustain
a denial of a statute denying minors access to sexually explicit ma-
terial “requires only that we be able to say that it was not irratio-
nal for the legislature to find that exposure to material condemned
by the statute is harmful to minors.” 539

    536  Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298 (1984).
    537  United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 430 (1993).
     538 Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994) (federal “must-

carry” provisions, which require cable television systems to devote a portion of their
channels to the transmission of local broadcast television stations, upheld as a content-
neutral, incidental restriction on speech, not subject to strict scrutiny). The Court
has applied the same principle in weighing the constitutionality of two other types
of speech restrictions to which it does not apply strict scrutiny: restrictions on com-
mercial speech, Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770–771 (1993) (“a governmental
body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that
the harms it recites are real”), and restrictions on campaign contributions, Nixon v.
Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 392 (2000) (“We have never ac-
cepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden”).
     539 Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 641 (1968) (upholding a ban on sale to

minors of “girlie” magazines, and noting that, although “studies all agree that a causal
link [between ‘minors’ reading and seeing ‘sexual material’ and an impairment in
their ‘ethical and moral development’] has not been demonstrated, they are equally
agreed that a causal link has not been disproved either,” id. at 641–42). In a case
involving a federal statute that restricted “signal bleed” of sexually explicit program-
ming on cable television, a federal district court wrote, “We recognize that the Su-
preme Court’s jurisprudence does not require empirical evidence. Only some mini-
mal amount of evidence is required when sexually explicit programming and children
are involved.” Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. v. U.S., 30 F. Supp. 2d 702, 716
(D. Del. 1998), aff’d, 529 U.S. 803 (2000). In a case upholding a statute that, to
shield minors from “indecent” material, limited the hours that such material may
be broadcast on radio and television, a federal court of appeals wrote, “Congress
does not need the testimony of psychiatrists and social scientists in order to take
note of the coarsening of impressionable minds that can result from a persistent
exposure to sexually explicit material. . . .” Action for Children’s Television v. FCC,
58 F.3d 654, 662 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (en banc), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1043 (1996). A
dissenting opinion complained, “[t]here is not one iota of evidence in the record . . .
to support the claim that exposure to indecency is harmful—indeed, the nature of
the alleged ‘harm’ is never explained.” Id. at 671 (Edwards, C.J., dissenting).
