requisite degree of certainty to justify restraint.” 428 Justice Bren-
nan’s concurring opinion flatly took the position that such restrain-
ing orders were never permissible. Commentary and reporting on
the criminal justice system is at the core of First Amendment val-
ues, he would have held, and secrecy can do so much harm “that
there can be no prohibition on the publication by the press of any
information pertaining to pending judicial proceedings or the opera-
tion of the criminal justice system, no matter how shabby the means
by which the information is obtained.” 429 The only circumstance in
which prior restraint of protected speech might be permissible is
when publication would cause “virtually certain, direct, and imme-
diate” national harm, Justice Brennan continued, but “the harm to
a fair trial that might otherwise eventuate from publications which
are suppressed . . . must inherently remain speculative.” 430 Al-
though the result in the case does not foreclose the possibility of
future “gag orders,” it does lessen the number to be expected and
shifts the focus to other alternatives for protecting trial rights.431
On a different level, however, are orders that restrain the press as
a party to litigation in the dissemination of information obtained
through pretrial discovery. In Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,432 the
Court determined that such orders protecting parties from abuses
of discovery require “no heightened First Amendment scrutiny.” 433
    Obscenity and Prior Restraint.—Only in the obscenity area
has there emerged a substantial consideration of the doctrine of prior
restraint, and the doctrine’s use there may be based upon the fact

     428 427 U.S. at 569–70. The Court distinguished between reporting on judicial

proceedings held in public and reporting of information gained from other sources,
but found that a heavy burden must be met to secure a prior restraint on either. Id.
at 570. See also Oklahoma Pub. Co. v. District Court, 430 U.S. 308 (1977) (setting
aside injunction restraining news media from publishing name of juvenile involved
in pending proceeding when name has been learned at open detention hearing that
could have been closed but was not); Smith v. Daily Mail Pub. Co., 443 U.S. 97 (1979).
     429 427 U.S. at 572, 588. Justices Stewart and Marshall joined this opinion and

Justice Stevens noted his general agreement except that he reserved decision in par-
ticularly egregious situations, even though stating that he might well agree with
Justice Brennan there also. Id. at 617. Justice White, while joining the opinion of
the Court, noted that he had grave doubts that “gag orders” could ever be justified
but he would refrain from so declaring in the Court’s first case on the issue. Id. at
570.
     430 427 U.S. at 599.
     431 One such alternative is the banning of communication with the press on trial

issues by prosecution and defense attorneys, police officials, and court officers. This,
of course, also raises First Amendment issues. See, e.g., Chicago Council of Lawyers
v. Bauer, 522 F.2d 242 (7th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 427 U.S. 912 (1976).
     432 467 U.S. 20 (1984).
     433 467 U.S. at 36. The decision was unanimous, all other Justices joining Jus-

tice Powell’s opinion for the Court, but Justices Brennan and Marshall noting addi-
tionally that under the facts of the case important interests in privacy and religious
freedom were being protected. Id. at 37, 38.
