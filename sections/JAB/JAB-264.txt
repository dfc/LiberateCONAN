not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or con-
trolled by the government.” 1395 “The crucial question is whether the
manner of expression is basically compatible with the normal activ-
ity of a particular place at a particular time.” 1396 Thus, by the na-
ture of the use to which the property is put or by tradition, some
sites are simply not as open for expression as streets and parks
are.1397 But if government does open non-traditional forums for ex-
pressive activities, it may not discriminate on the basis of content
or viewpoint in according access.1398 The Court, however, remains
divided with respect to the reach of the public forum doctrine.1399
    Speech in public forums is subject to time, place, and manner
regulations that take into account such matters as control of traffic
in the streets, the scheduling of two meetings or demonstrations at
the same time and place, the preventing of blockages of building
entrances, and the like.1400 Such regulations are closely scrutinized
in order to protect free expression, and, to be valid, must be justi-
fied without reference to the content or subject matter of speech,1401
