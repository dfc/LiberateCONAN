Miller test is not subject to a community standards test; instead,
the appropriate standard is “whether a reasonable person would find
[literary, artistic, political, or scientific] value in the material, taken
as a whole.” 1311
     The Court in Miller reiterated that it was not permitting an
unlimited degree of suppression of materials. Only “hard core” ma-
terials were to be deemed without the protection of the First Amend-
ment, and the Court’s idea of the content of “hard core” pornogra-
phy was revealed in its examples: “(a) Patently offensive
representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or
perverted, actual or simulated. (b) Patently offensive representa-
tions or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd
exhibition of the genitals.” 1312 Subsequently, the Court held that a
publication was not obscene if it “provoked only normal, healthy sexual
desires.” To be obscene it must appeal to “a shameful or morbid in-
terest in nudity, sex, or excretion.” 1313 The Court has also indi-
cated that obscenity is not be limited to pictures; books containing
only descriptive language may be suppressed.1314
     First Amendment values, the Court stressed in Miller, “are ad-
equately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to con-
duct an independent review of constitutional claims when neces-
sary.” 1315 But the Court had conferred on juries as triers of fact
the determination, based upon their understanding of community
standards, whether material was “patently offensive.” Did not this
virtually immunize these questions from appellate review? In Jen-
kins v. Georgia,1316 the Court, while adhering to the Miller stan-
dards, stated that “juries [do not] have unbridled discretion in de-
termining what is ‘patently offensive.’ ” Miller was intended to make
clear that only “hard-core” materials could be suppressed and this
concept and the Court’s descriptive itemization of some types of
lation except for dealings with children does not preclude permitting the jurors in
the federal case to make their own definitions of what is offensive to contemporary
community standards; they may be told of the legislature’s decision but they are not
bound by it. Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291 (1977).
     1311 Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 500–01 (1987).
     1312 Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973). Quoting Miller’s language in

Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 114 (1974), the Court reiterated that it was
only “hard-core” material that was unprotected. “While the particular descriptions
there contained were not intended to be exhaustive, they clearly indicate that there
is a limit beyond which neither legislative draftsmen nor juries may go in conclud-
ing that particular material is ‘patently offensive’ within the meaning of the obscen-
ity test set forth in the Miller cases.” Referring to this language in Ward v. Illinois,
431 U.S. 767 (1977), the Court upheld a state court’s power to construe its statute
to reach sadomasochistic materials not within the confines of the Miller language.
