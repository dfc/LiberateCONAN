inconsistent.252 It has long been held that the Free Exercise Clause
does not necessarily prevent the government from requiring the do-
ing of some act or forbidding the doing of some act merely because
religious beliefs underlie the conduct in question.253 What has changed
over the years is the Court’s willingness to hold that some reli-
giously motivated conduct is protected from generally applicable pro-
hibitions.
     The relationship between the Free Exercise and Establishment
Clauses varies with the expansiveness of interpretation of the two
clauses. In a general sense both clauses proscribe governmental in-
volvement with and interference in religious matters, but there is
possible tension between a requirement of governmental neutrality
derived from the Establishment Clause and a Free-Exercise-
derived requirement that government accommodate some religious
practices.254 So far, the Court has harmonized interpretation by de-
nying that free-exercise-mandated accommodations create establish-
ment violations, and also by upholding some legislative accommoda-
tions not mandated by free exercise requirements. “This Court has
long recognized that government may (and sometimes must) accom-
modate religious practices and that it may do so without violating
the Establishment Clause.” 255 “There is room for play in the joints
productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious ex-
ercise to exist without [governmental] sponsorship and without in-
terference.” 256

to Sabbatarians who refused Saturday work, for example, the Court
denied that it was “fostering an ‘establishment’ of the Seventh-Day
Adventist religion, for the extension of unemployment benefits to

practices as well as beliefs are protected by the Free Exercise Clause. For contrast-
ing academic views of the origins and purposes of the Free Exercise Clause, com-

gion, 103 HARV. L. REV. 1410 (1990) (concluding that constitutionally compelled exemptions
from generally applicable laws are consistent with the Clause’s origins in religious
pluralism) with Marshall, The Case Against the Constitutionally Compelled Free Ex-
ercise Exemption, 40 CASE W. RES. L. REV. 357 (1989–90) (arguing that such exemp-
tions establish an invalid preference for religious beliefs over non-religious beliefs).

Clauses, both of which are cast in absolute terms, and either of which, if expanded
