covert forms of discrimination against expression and between dif-
ferent kinds of content, the Court has insisted that licensing sys-
tems be constructed as free as possible of the opportunity for arbi-
trary administration.1409 The Court has also applied its general
strictures against prior restraints in the contexts of permit sys-
tems and judicial restraint of expression.1410
    It appears that government may not deny access to the public
forum for demonstrators on the ground that the past meetings of


cess to nonpublic areas. See, e.g., Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n,
460 U.S. 37, 48 (1983) (use of school mail system); and Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, 473 U.S. 788 (1985) (charitable solicitation of fed-
eral employees at workplace). See also Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S.
298 (1974) (city may sell commercial advertising space on the walls of its rapid tran-
sit cars but refuse to sell political advertising space); Capitol Square Review Bd. v.
Pinette, 515 U.S. 753 (1995) (denial of permission to Ku Klux Klan, allegedly in
order to avoid Establishment Clause violation, to place a cross in plaza on grounds
of state capitol); Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995) (Univer-
sity’s subsidy for printing costs of student publications, available for student “news,
information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications,” could not be with-
held because of the religious content of a student publication); Lamb’s Chapel v. Cen-
ter Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993) (school district rule prohibiting after-
hours use of school property for showing of a film presenting a religious perspective
on child-rearing and family values, but allowing after-hours use for non-religious
social, civic, and recreational purposes).
     1409 E.g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 516 (1939); Schneider v. Town of Irvington,

308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 (1941); Poulos v.
New Hampshire, 345 U.S. 395 (1953); Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 321–25
(1958); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 555–58 (1965); Shuttlesworth v. City of Bir-
mingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150–53 (1969). Justice Stewart for the Court described these
and other cases as “holding that a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment
freedoms to the prior restraint of a license without narrow, objective, and definite
standards to guide the licensing authority is unconstitutional.” Id. at 150–51. A per-
son faced with an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it, engage in the de-
sired conduct, and challenge the constitutionality of the permit system upon a sub-
sequent prosecution for violating it. Id. at 151; Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584, 602
(1942) (Chief Justice Stone dissenting), adopted per curiam on rehearing, 319 U.S.
103 (1943). See also City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750
(1988) (upholding facial challenge to ordinance vesting in the mayor unbridled dis-
cretion to grant or deny annual permit for location of newsracks on public prop-
erty); Riley v. National Fed’n of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781 (1988) (invalidating as per-
mitting “delay without limit” licensing requirement for professional fundraisers); Forsyth
County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123 (1992). But see Walker v. City of Bir-
mingham, 388 U.S. 307 (1967) (same rule not applicable to injunctions).
     1410 In Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147 (1969), the Court re-

affirmed the holdings of the earlier cases, and, additionally, both Justice Stewart,
for the Court, id. at 155 n.4, and Justice Harlan concurring, id. at 162–64, asserted
that the principles of Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51 (1965), governing systems
of prior censorship of motion pictures, were relevant to permit systems for parades
and demonstrations. The Court also voided an injunction against a protest meeting
that was issued ex parte, without notice to the protestors and with, of course, no
opportunity for them to rebut the representations of the seekers of the injunction.
