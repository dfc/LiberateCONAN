deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected
speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in ef-
fect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government
to ‘produce a result which [it] could not command directly.’ Such
interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.” 769
     However, the fact that government does not have carte blanche
in dealing with the constitutional rights of its employees does not
mean that it has no power at all. “[I]t cannot be gainsaid,” the Court
said in Pickering v. Board of Education, “that the State has inter-
ests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that
differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regu-
lation of the speech of the citizenry in general.” 770 Pickering con-
cerned the dismissal of a high school teacher who had written a
critical letter to a local newspaper reflecting on the administration
of the school system. The letter also contained several factual er-
rors. “The problem in any case,” Justice Marshall wrote for the Court,
“is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a
citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the in-
terest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of
the public services it performs through its employees.” 771 The Court
laid down no general standard, but undertook a suggestive analy-
sis. Dismissal of a public employee for criticism of his superiors was
improper, the Court indicated, where the relationship of employee
to superior was not so close, such as day-to-day personal contact,
that problems of discipline or of harmony among coworkers, or prob-
lems of personal loyalty and confidence, would arise.772 The school
board had not shown that any harm had resulted from the false
     769 Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (citation omitted). In a com-

panion case, the Court noted that the privilege basis for the appeals court’s due pro-
cess holding in Bailey “has been thoroughly undermined in the ensuing years.” Board
of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 571 n.9 (1972). The test now in due process and
other such cases is whether government has conferred a property right in employ-
ment which it must respect, but the inquiry when it is alleged that an employee
has been penalized for the assertion of a constitutional right is that stated in the
text. A finding, however, that protected expression or conduct played a substantial
part in the decision to dismiss or punish does not conclude the case; the employer
may show by a preponderance of the evidence that the same decision would have
been reached in the absence of the protected expression or conduct. Mt. Healthy

Pickering was distinguished on the basis that the employee, an assistant district
attorney, worked in an environment where a close personal relationship involving
loyalty and harmony was important. “When close working relationships are essen-
tial to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer’s
judgment is appropriate.” Id. at 151–52.
