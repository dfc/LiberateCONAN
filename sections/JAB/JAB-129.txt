Amendment rights of non-union members, the majority more spe-
cifically held that the Constitution required that separate notices
be sent out for special political assessments that allowed non-
union employees to opt in rather than requiring them to opt out.662
Two concurring Justices, echoed by the dissenters, heavily criti-
cized the majority for reaching “significant constitutional issues not
contained in the questions presented, briefed, or argued.” Rather,
the concurrence more narrowly found that unions may not collect
special political assesments from non-union members who earlier
objected to nonchargeable (i.e., political) expenses, and could only
collect from nonobjecting nonmembers after giving notice and an
opportunity to opt out.663
    In Ysursa v. Pocatello Education Ass’n,664 the Court upheld an
Idaho statute that prohibited payroll deductions for union political
activities. Because the statute did not restrict political speech, but
merely declined to subsidize it by providing for payroll deductions,
the state did not abridge the union’s First Amendment right and
therefore could justify the ban merely by demonstrating a rational
basis for it. The Court found that it was “justified by the State’s
interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favor-
itism or entanglement with partisan politics.” 665
    The Court has held that a labor relations body may not pre-
vent a union member or employee represented exclusively by a union
from speaking out at a public meeting on an issue of public con-
cern, simply because the issue was a subject of collective bargain-
ing between the union and the employer.666

Maintenance of National Security and the First
 Amendment
    Preservation of the security of the Nation from its enemies, for-
eign and domestic, is the obligation of government and one of the
foremost reasons for government to exist. Pursuit of this goal may
lead government officials at times to trespass in areas protected by
     662 567 U.S. ___, No. 10–1121, slip op. at 17 (2012) (Alito, J., joined by Roberts,

C.J., and by Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ.).
     663 567 U.S. ___, No. 10–1121, slip op. (2012) (Sotomayor, J., joined by Ginsburg,

J., concurring).
     664 129 S. Ct. 1093 (2009).
     665 129 S. Ct. at 1098. The unions had argued that, even if the limitation was

valid as applied at the state level, it violated their First Amendment rights when
applied to local public employers. The Court held that a political subdivision, “cre-
ated by the state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges or immu-
nities under the federal constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of
its creator.” Id. at 1101, quoting Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, 289 U.S. 36, 40
(1933).
