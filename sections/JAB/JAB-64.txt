and practices.309 The governmental interest was not the general pro-
vision of education, as the state and the Amish agreed as to educa-
tion through the first eight grades and as the Amish provided their
children with additional education of a primarily vocational na-
ture. The state’s interest was really that of providing two addi-
tional years of public schooling. Nothing in the record, the Court
found, showed that this interest outweighed the great harm that it
would do to traditional Amish religious beliefs to impose the com-
pulsory ninth and tenth grade attendance.310
    But a subsequent decision involving the Amish reached a con-
trary conclusion. In United States v. Lee,311 the Court denied the
Amish exemption from compulsory participation in the Social Secu-
rity system. The objection was that payment of taxes by Amish em-
ployers and employees and the receipt of public financial assis-
tance were forbidden by their religious beliefs. Accepting that this
was true, the Court nonetheless held that the governmental inter-
est was compelling and therefore sufficient to justify the burdening
of religious beliefs.312 Compulsory payment of taxes was necessary
for the vitality of the system; either voluntary participation or a
pattern of exceptions would undermine its soundness and make the
program difficult to administer.
    “A compelling governmental interest” was also found to out-
weigh free exercise interests in Bob Jones University v. United
States,313 in which the Court upheld the I.R.S.’s denial of tax exemp-
tions to church-run colleges whose racially discriminatory admis-
sions policies derived from religious beliefs. The Federal Govern-
ment’s “fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial
discrimination in education”—found to be encompassed in common
law standards of “charity” underlying conferral of the tax exemp-
tion on “charitable” institutions—“substantially outweighs” the bur-
den on free exercise. Nor could the schools’ free exercise interests
be accommodated by less restrictive means.314
    In other cases, the Court found reasons not to apply compelling
interest analysis. Religiously motivated speech, like other speech,

free exercise imposed by disallowance of a tax deduction was “justified by the ‘broad
public interest in maintaining a sound tax system’ free of ‘myriad exceptions flow-
ing from a wide variety of religious beliefs’ ”).
