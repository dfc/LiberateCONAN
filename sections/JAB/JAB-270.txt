rum (shopping mall as well as airport) made restrictions on expres-

    In United States v. American Library Association, Inc., a four-
Justice plurality of the Supreme Court found that “Internet access
in public libraries is neither a ‘traditional’ nor a ‘designated’ public
forum.” 1427 The plurality therefore did not apply “strict scrutiny”
in upholding the Children’s Internet Protection Act, which, as the
plurality summarized it, provides that a public school or “library
may not receive federal assistance to provide Internet access un-
less it installs software to block images that constitute obscenity or
child pornography, and to prevent minors from obtaining access to
material that is harmful to them.” 1428 The plurality found that In-
ternet access in public libraries is not a “traditional” public forum
because “[w]e have ‘rejected the view that traditional public forum
status extends beyond its historical confines.’ ” 1429 And Internet ac-
cess at public libraries is not a “designated” public forum because
“[a] public library does not acquire Internet terminals in order to
create a public forum for Web publishers to express themselves, any
more than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for
the authors of books to speak. It provides Internet access, not to
‘encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,’ but for the
same reasons it offers other library resources: to facilitate re-
search, learning, and recreational pursuits by furnishing materials
of requisite and appropriate quality.” 1430
    Nevertheless, although Internet access in public libraries is not
a public forum, and particular Web sites, like particular newspa-
pers, would not constitute public forums, the Internet as a whole
might be viewed as a public forum, despite its lack of a historic
tradition. The Supreme Court has not explicitly held that the Inter-
net as a whole is a public forum, but, in Reno v. ACLU, which struck
down a prohibition in the Communications Decency Act of 1996 on
“indecent” material on the Internet, the Court noted that the Inter-
net “constitutes a vast platform from which to address and hear
from a worldwide audience of millions of readers, viewers, research-
