     Adjudication over the constitutional law of obscenity began in
Roth v. United States,1280 in which the Court in an opinion by Jus-
tice Brennan settled in the negative the “dispositive question” “whether
obscenity is utterance within the area of protected speech and
press.” 1281 The Court then undertook a brief historical survey to
demonstrate that “the unconditional phrasing of the First Amend-
ment was not intended to protect every utterance.” All or practi-
cally all the states that ratified the First Amendment had laws mak-
ing blasphemy or profanity or both crimes, and provided for
prosecutions of libels as well. It was this history that had caused
the Court in Beauharnais to conclude that “libelous utterances are
not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,” and this
history was deemed to demonstrate that “obscenity, too, was out-
side the protection intended for speech and press.” 1282 “The protec-
tion given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered in-
terchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes
desired by the people . . . . All ideas having even the slightest re-
deeming social importance—unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas,
even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion—have the
full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable because they en-
croach upon the limited area of more important interests. But im-
plicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of ob-
scenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.” 1283 It was
objected that obscenity legislation punishes because of incitation to
impure thoughts and without proof that obscene materials create a
clear and present danger of antisocial conduct. But because obscen-
ity was not protected at all, such tests as clear and present danger
were irrelevant.1284
    “However,” Justice Brennan continued, “sex and obscenity are
not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex
in a manner appealing to prurient interest. The portrayal of sex,

ion was Alberts v. California, involving, of course, a state obscenity law. The Court’s
first opinion in the obscenity field was Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957), con-
sidered infra. Earlier the Court had divided four-to-four and thus affirmed a state
court judgment that Edmund Wilson’s Memoirs of Hecate County was obscene. Doubleday

     1281 Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 481 (1957). Justice Brennan later changed

his mind on this score, arguing that, because the Court had failed to develop a work-
able standard for distinguishing the obscene from the non-obscene, regulation should
be confined to the protection of children and non-consenting adults. See Paris Adult
