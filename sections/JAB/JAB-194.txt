as violating the Boy Scouts’ “right of expressive association.” 1012 Re-
cruiters, unlike the scoutmaster, are “outsiders who come onto cam-
pus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students—not to be-
come members of the school’s expressive association.” 1013

Governmental Regulation of Communications Industries
    As in the previous section, the governmental regulations here
considered may have only the most indirect relation to freedom of
expression, or may clearly implicate that freedom even though the
purpose of the particular regulation is not to reach the content of
the message. First, however, the judicially formulated doctrine dis-
tinguishing commercial expression from other forms is briefly con-
sidered.
    Commercial Speech.—Starting in the 1970s, the Court’s treat-
ment of “commercial speech” underwent a transformation from to-
tal nonprotection under the First Amendment to qualified protec-
tion. The conclusion that a communication proposing a commercial
transaction is a different order of speech underserving of First Amend-
ment protection was arrived at almost casually in 1942 in Valen-
tine v. Chrestensen.1014 In Chrestensen, the Court upheld a city or-
dinance prohibiting distribution on the street of “commercial and
business advertising matter,” as applied to an exhibitor of a subma-
rine who distributed leaflets describing his submarine on one side
and on the other side protesting the city’s refusal of certain dock-
ing facilities. The doctrine was in any event limited to promotion of
commercial activities; the fact that expression was disseminated for
profit or through commercial channels did not expose it to any greater
regulation than if it were offered for free.1015 The doctrine lasted in
this form for more than twenty years.
    The Court later modified this position so that commercial speech
is protected “from unwarranted governmental regulation,” al-

(2000).
    1013  547 U.S. at 69.
    1014  316 U.S. 52 (1942). See also Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622 (1951).
The doctrine was one of the bases upon which the banning of all commercials for
cigarettes from radio and television was upheld. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitch-
ell, 333 F. Supp. 582 (D.D.C. 1971) (three-judge court), aff’d per curiam, 405 U.S.
1000 (1972).

political and social matters which newspapers carry for a fee, New York Times Co.

admission fee, United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 166 (1948); Jo-
seph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 501–02 (1952), were all during this pe-
riod held entitled to full First Amendment protection regardless of the commercial
element involved.
