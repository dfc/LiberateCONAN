Court struck the order down as violating the First Amendment.594
“[A]bstract discussion is not the only species of communication which
the Constitution protects; the First Amendment also protects vigor-
ous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, against governmental intru-
sion. . . . In the context of NAACP objectives, litigation is not a tech-
nique of resolving private differences; it is a means for achieving
the lawful objectives of equality of treatment by all government, fed-
eral, state and local, for the members of the Negro community in
this country. It is thus a form of political expression. . . .”
    “We need not, in order to find constitutional protection for the
kind of cooperative, organizational activity disclosed by this record,
whereby Negroes seek through lawful means to achieve legitimate
political ends, subsume such activity under a narrow, literal concep-
tion of freedom of speech, petition or assembly. For there is no lon-
ger any doubt that the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect
certain forms of orderly group activity.” 595 This decision was fol-
lowed in three cases in which the Court held that labor unions en-
joyed First Amendment protection in assisting their members in pur-
suing their legal remedies to recover for injuries and other actions.
In the first case, the union advised members to seek legal advice
before settling injury claims and recommended particular attor-
neys; 596 in the second the union retained attorneys on a salaried
basis to represent members; 597 in the third, the union recom-
mended certain attorneys whose fee would not exceed a specified
percentage of the recovery.598 Justice Black wrote: “[T]he First Amend-

    595  371 U.S. at 429–30. Button was applied in In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 (1978),
in which the Court found foreclosed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments the
discipline visited upon a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union
who had solicited someone to use the ACLU to bring suit to contest the sterilization
of Medicaid recipients. Both the NAACP and the ACLU were organizations that en-
gaged in extensive litigation as well as lobbying and educational activities, all of
which were means of political expression. “[T]he efficacy of litigation as a means of
advancing the cause of civil liberties often depends on the ability to make legal as-
sistance available to suitable litigants.” Id. at 431. “[C]ollective activity undertaken
to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protec-
tion of the First Amendment.” Id. at 426. However, ordinary law practice for commer-
cial ends is not given special protection. “A lawyer’s procurement of remunerative
employment is a subject only marginally affected with First Amendment concerns.”
