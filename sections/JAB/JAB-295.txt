the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment means, of course,
that the Cruikshank limitation is no longer applicable.1565
     The Hague Case.—Illustrative of this expansion is Hague v.
CIO,1566 in which the Court, though splintered with regard to rea-
soning and rationale, struck down an ordinance that vested an un-
controlled discretion in a city official to permit or deny any group
the opportunity to conduct a public assembly in a public place. Jus-
tice Roberts, in an opinion that Justice Black joined and with which
Chief Justice Hughes concurred, found protection against state abridg-
ment of the rights of assembly and petition in the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. “The privilege
of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for
communication of views on national questions may be regulated in
the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be ex-
ercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and
in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the
guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.” 1567 Justices Stone and
Reed invoked the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment for the result, thereby claiming the rights of assembly and
petition for aliens as well as citizens. “I think respondents’ right to
maintain it does not depend on their citizenship and cannot rightly
be made to turn on the existence or non-existence of a purpose to
disseminate information about the National Labor Relations Act. It
is enough that petitioners have prevented respondents from hold-
ing meetings and disseminating information whether for the orga-
nization of labor unions or for any other lawful purpose.” 1568 This
due process view of Justice Stone’s has carried the day over the
privileges and immunities approach.
    Later cases tend to merge the rights of assembly and petition
into the speech and press clauses, and, indeed, all four rights may
well be considered as elements of an inclusive right to freedom of
expression. While certain conduct may still be denominated as ei-
ther petition 1569 or assembly 1570 rather than speech, there seems

Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252 (1941); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945).
     1566 307 U.S. 496 (1939).
     1567 307 U.S. at 515. For another holding that the right to petition is not abso-

lute, see McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479 (1985) (the fact that defamatory state-
ments were made in the context of a petition to government does not provide abso-
lute immunity from libel).
     1568 307 U.S. at 525.

Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127 (1961); BE & K Construction Co. v. NLRB,
