vestigating agency show “a subordinating interest which is compel-

Court found would result from the inquiry.730 The issues in this field,
thus, remain unsettled.
    Interference With Vietnam War Effort.—Possibly the most cel-
ebrated governmental action in response to dissent to the Vietnam
War—the prosecution of Dr. Benjamin Spock and four others for con-
spiring to counsel, aid, and abet persons to evade the draft—failed
to reach the Supreme Court.731 Aside from a comparatively minor
case,732 the Court’s sole encounter with a Vietnam War protest al-
legedly involving protected “symbolic conduct” was United States v.
O’Brien.733 That case affirmed a conviction and upheld a congressio-
nal prohibition against destruction of draft registration certificates;
O’Brien had publicly burned his draft card. “We cannot accept the
view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled
‘speech’ whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby
to express an idea. However, even on the assumption that the al-
leged communicative element in O’Brien’s conduct is sufficient to
bring into play the First Amendment, it does not necessarily follow
that the destruction of a registration certificate is constitutionally
protected activity. This Court has held that when ‘speech’ and
‘nonspeech’ elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a
sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the
nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amend-
ment freedoms.” 734 Finding that the government’s interest in hav-
ing registrants retain their cards at all times was an important one
and that the prohibition of destruction of the cards worked no re-
striction of First Amendment freedoms broader than necessary to
serve the interest, the Court upheld the statute. Subsequently, the
Court upheld a “passive enforcement” policy singling out for pros-

     732 In Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970), the Court reversed a convic-

tion under 18 U.S.C. § 702 for wearing a military uniform without authority. The
defendant had worn the uniform in a skit in an on-the-street anti-war demonstra-
tion, and 10 U.S.C. § 772(f) authorized the wearing of a military uniform in a “the-
atrical production” so long as the performance did not “tend to discredit” the mili-
tary. This last clause the Court held an unconstitutional limitation of speech.
