In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,1142 the Court struck down a hate crimes
ordinance construed by the state courts to apply only to use of “fight-
ing words.” The difficulty, the Court found, was that the ordinance
made a further content discrimination, proscribing only those fight-
ing words that “arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others . . .
on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.” 1143 This amounted
to “special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on dis-
favored subjects.” 1144 The fact that government may proscribe ar-
eas of speech such as obscenity, defamation, or fighting words does
not mean that these areas “may be made the vehicles for content
discrimination unrelated to their distinctively proscribable content.
Thus, the government may proscribe libel; but it may not make the
further content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the
government.” 1145
     The constitutionality of content-based regulation of fully pro-
tected expression is determined by a compelling interest test de-
rived from equal protection analysis: government “must show that
its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling interest and is nar-
rowly drawn to achieve that end.” 1146 Narrow tailoring in the case
of fully protected speech requires that the government “choose[ ]
the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.” 1147
Application of this test ordinarily results in invalidation of the regu-
lation.1148 Objecting to the balancing approach inherent in this test
because it “might be read as a concession that States may censor
speech whenever they believe there is a compelling justification for
doing so,” Justice Kennedy argued instead for a rule of per se inva-
lidity.1149 But compelling interest analysis can still be useful, Jus-
tice Kennedy suggested, in determining whether a regulation is
content-based or content-neutral; in those cases in which the gov-
ernment tenders “a plausible justification unrelated to the suppres-
sion of expression,” application of the compelling interest test may
