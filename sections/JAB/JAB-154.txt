ployees make statements pursuant to their official duties,” even if
those statements are about matters of public concern.791 In this case,
a deputy district attorney had presented his supervisor with a memo
expressing his concern that an affidavit that the office had used to
obtain a search warrant contained serious misrepresentations. The
deputy district attorney claimed that he was subjected to retalia-
tory employment actions, and he sued. The Supreme Court held “that
when public employees make statements pursuant to their official
duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amend-
ment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their commu-
nications from employer discipline.” 792 The fact that the employee’s
speech occurred inside his office, and the fact that the speech con-
cerned the subject matter of his employment, were not sufficient to
foreclose First Amendment protection.793 Rather, the “controlling fac-
tor” was “that his expressions were made pursuant to his du-
ties.” 794 Therefore, another employee in the office, with different du-
ties, might have had a First Amendment right to utter the speech
in question, and the deputy district attorney himself might have
had a First Amendment right to communicate the information that
he had in a letter to the editor of a newspaper. In these two in-
stances, a court would apply Pickering balancing.
     The protections applicable to government employees have been
extended to independent government contractors, the Court announc-
ing that “the Pickering balancing test, adjusted to weigh the govern-
ment’s interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines
the extent of their protection.” 795
     In sum, although a public employer may not muzzle its employ-
ees or penalize them for their expressions and associations to the
    791  547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006).
    792  547 U.S. at 421. However, “[s]o long as employees are speaking as citizens
about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that
are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.” Id. at 419.
Such necessity, however, may be based on a “common-sense conclusion” rather than
on “empirical data.” Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass’n v. Brentwood Acad-
emy, 551 U.S. 291, 300 (2007) (citing Garcetti).
     793 The Court cited Givhan v. Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., 439 U.S. 410 (1979),

for these points. In Givhan, the Court had upheld the First Amendment right of a
public school teacher to complain to the school principal about “employment policies
and practices at [the] school which [she] conceived to be racially discriminatory in
purpose or effect.” Id. at 413. The difference between Givhan and Ceballos was ap-
parently that Givhan’s complaints were not made pursuant to her job duties, whereas
Ceballos’ were. Therefore, Givhan spoke as a citizen whereas Ceballos spoke as a
government employee. See Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 420–21.

cise of rights of political association or the expression of political allegiance”).
