declaration of the right of the free exercise of religion, and a prohi-
bition (as we have seen) of all religious tests. Thus, the whole power
over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state govern-
ments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and
the state constitutions; and the Catholic and the Protestant, the Cal-
vinist and the Arminian, the Jew and the Infidel, may sit down at
the common table of the national councils, without any inquisition
into their faith, or mode of worship.” 7
    “Probably,” Story also wrote, “at the time of the adoption of the
constitution and of the amendment to it, now under consideration,
the general, if not the universal, sentiment in America was, that
Christianity ought to receive encouragement from the state, so far
as was not incompatible with the private rights of conscience, and
the freedom of religious worship. An attempt to level all religions,
and to make it a matter of state policy to hold all in utter indiffer-
ence, would have created universal disapprobation, if not universal
indignation.” 8 The object, then, of the religion clauses in this view
was not to prevent general governmental encouragement of reli-
gion, of Christianity, but to prevent religious persecution and to pre-
vent a national establishment.9
    Not until the Supreme Court held the religion clauses appli-
cable to the states in the 1940s 10 did it have much opportunity to
interpret them. But it quickly gave them a broad construction. In
Everson v. Board of Education,11 the Court, without dissent on this
point, declared that the Establishment Clause forbids not only prac-
tices that “aid one religion” or “prefer one religion over another,”
but also those that “aid all religions.” With respect to the Free Ex-
ercise Clause, it asserted in Wisconsin v. Yoder 12 that “only those
interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can
overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.”
    More recent decisions, however, evidence a narrower interpreta-
tion of the religion clauses. Indeed, in Employment Division, Or-
egon Department of Human Resources v. Smith 13 the Court aban-
doned its earlier view and held that the Free Exercise Clause never
“relieve[s] an individual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid
