tive of earning a profit.1353 The Third Circuit upheld a preliminary
injunction against enforcement of the statute on the ground that,
“because the standard by which COPA gauges whether material is
‘harmful to minors’ is based on identifying ‘contemporary commu-
nity standards[,]’ the inability of Web publishers to restrict access
to their Web sites based on the geographic locale of the site visitor,
in and of itself, imposes an impermissible burden on constitution-
ally protected First Amendment speech.” 1354 This is because it re-
sults in communications available to a nationwide audience being
judged by the standards of the community most likely to be of-
fended. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding “that
COPA’s reliance on community standards to identify ‘material that
is harmful to minors’ does not by itself render the statute substan-
tially overbroad for purposes of the First Amendment.” 1355
     Upon remand, the Third Circuit again upheld the preliminary
injunction, and the Supreme Court affirmed and remanded the case
for trial. The Supreme Court found that the district court had not
abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction, be-
cause the government had failed to show that proposed alterna-
tives to COPA would not be as effective in accomplishing its goal.
The primary alternative to COPA, the Court noted, is blocking and
filtering software. Filters are less restrictive than COPA because “[t]hey
impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not uni-
versal restriction at the source.” 1356 Subsequently, the district court
found COPA to violate the First Amendment and issued a perma-
nent injunction against its enforcement; the Third Circuit affirmed,
and the Supreme Court denied certioriari.1357
     In United States v. American Library Association, Inc., a four-
Justice plurality of the Supreme Court upheld the Children’s Inter-
net Protection Act (CIPA), which, as the plurality summarized it,
provides that a public school or “library may not receive federal as-
sistance to provide Internet access unless it installs software to block
     1353 “Harmful to minors” statutes ban the distribution of material to minors that

is not necessarily obscene under the Miller test. In Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S.
629, 641 (1968), the Supreme Court, applying a rational basis standard, upheld New
York’s harmful-to-minors statute.

     1356 Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 667 (2004). Justice Breyer, dissenting, wrote

that blocking and filtering software is not a less restrictive alternative because “it is
part of the status quo” and “[i]t is always less restrictive to do nothing than to do
something.” Id. at 684. The majority opinion countered that Congress “may act to
encourage the use of filters,” and “[t]he need for parental cooperation does not auto-
matically disqualify a proposed less restrictive alternative.” Id. at 669.
