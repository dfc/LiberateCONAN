hardcore materials were “intended to fix substantive constitutional
limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of ma-
terial subject to such a determination.” The Court’s own viewing of
the motion picture in question convinced it that “[n]othing in the
movie falls within either of the two examples given in Miller of ma-
terial which may constitutionally be found to meet the ‘patently of-
fensive’ element of those standards, nor is there anything suffi-
ciently similar to such material to justify similar treatment.” 1317 But,
in a companion case, the Court found that a jury determination of
obscenity “was supported by the evidence and consistent with” the
standards.1318
    The decisions from the Paris Adult Theatre and Miller era were
rendered by narrow majorities,1319 but nonetheless have guided the
Court since. In addition, the Court’s willingness to allow some regu-
lation of non-obscene but sexually explicit or “indecent” expression
reduces the importance (outside the criminal area) of whether ma-
terial is classified as obscene.
    Even as to materials falling within the constitutional definition
of obscene, the Court has recognized a limited private, protected
interest in possession within the home,1320 unless those materials
constitute child pornography. Stanley v. Georgia was an appeal from
a state conviction for possession of obscene films discovered in ap-
pellant’s home by police officers armed with a search warrant for
other items which were not found. The Court reversed, holding that
the mere private possession of obscene materials in the home can-
not be made a criminal offense. The Constitution protects the right
to receive information and ideas, the Court said, regardless of their
social value, and “that right takes on an added dimension” in the
context of a prosecution for possession of something in one’s own
home. “For also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very

    1318 Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974). In Smith v. United States,
431 U.S. 291, 305–06 (1977), the Court explained that jury determinations in accor-
dance with their own understanding of the tolerance of the average person in their
community are not unreviewable. Judicial review would pass on (1) whether the jury
was properly instructed to consider the entire community and not simply the mem-
bers’ own subjective reaction or the reactions of a sensitive or of a callous minority,
(2) whether the conduct depicted fell within the examples specified in Miller, (3)
whether the work lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and
(4) whether the evidence was sufficient. The Court indicated that the value test of
Miller “was particularly amenable to judicial review.” The value test is not to be
measured by community standards, the Court later held in Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S.
497 (1987), but instead by a “reasonable person” standard. An erroneous instruction
on this score, however, may be “harmless error.” Id. at 503.
