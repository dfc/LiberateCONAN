     Suppression of Communist Propaganda in the Mails.—A
1962 statute authorizing the Post Office Department to retain all
mail from abroad that was determined to be “communist political
propaganda” and to forward it to an addressee only upon his re-
quest was held unconstitutional in Lamont v. Postmaster Gen-
eral.736 The Court held that to require anyone to request receipt of
mail determined to be undesirable by the government was certain
to deter and inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights to re-
ceive information.737 Distinguishing Lamont, the Court in 1987 up-
held statutory classification as “political propaganda” of communi-
cations or expressions by or on behalf of foreign governments, foreign
“principals,” or their agents, and reasonably adapted or intended to
influence United States foreign policy.738 “The physical detention of
materials, not their mere designation as ‘communist political propa-
ganda,’ was the offending element of the statutory scheme [in
Lamont].” 739
     Exclusion of Certain Aliens as a First Amendment Prob-
lem.—Although a nonresident alien might be able to present no claim,
based on the First Amendment or on any other constitutional pro-
vision, to overcome a governmental decision to exclude him from
the country, it was arguable that United States citizens who could
assert a First Amendment interest in hearing the alien and receiv-
ing information from him, such as the right recognized in Lamont,
could be able to contest such exclusion.740 But the Court declined
to reach the First Amendment issue and to place it in balance when
it found that a governmental refusal to waive a statutory exclu-

First Amendment rights to speak out against the draft was no greater than neces-
sary to further the government’s interests in “prosecutorial efficiency,” obtaining suf-
ficient proof prior to prosecution, and promoting general deterrence (or not appear-
ing to condone open defiance of the law). See also United States v. Albertini, 472
U.S. 675 (1985) (order banning a civilian from entering military base upheld as ap-
plied to attendance at base open house by individual previously convicted of destroy-
ing military property).

clauses.

eral cases, e.g., Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943); Thomas v. Collins,
