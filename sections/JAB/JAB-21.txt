    State aid to church-connected schools was first found to have
gone over the “verge” 88 in Lemon v. Kurtzman.89 The Court struck
down two state statutes, one of which authorized the “purchase” of
secular educational services from nonpublic elementary and second-
ary schools, a form of reimbursement for the cost to religious schools
of the teaching of such things as mathematics, modern foreign lan-
guages, and physical sciences, and the other of which provided sal-
ary supplements to nonpublic school teachers who taught courses
similar to those found in public schools, used textbooks approved
for use in public schools, and agreed not to teach any classes in
religion. Accepting the secular purpose attached to both statutes by
the legislature, the Court did not pass on the secular effect test,
but found excessive entanglement. This entanglement arose be-
cause the legislature “has not, and could not, provide state aid on
the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers under reli-
gious discipline can avoid conflicts. The State must be certain, given
the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate reli-
gion . . . .” 90 Because the schools concerned were religious schools,
because they were under the control of the church hierarchy, and
because the primary purpose of the schools was the propagation of
the faith, a “comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state
surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that these restric-
tions [on religious use of aid] are obeyed and the First Amendment
otherwise respected.” 91 Moreover, the provision of public aid inevi-
tably will draw religious conflict into the public arena as the con-
test for adequate funding goes on. Thus, the Court held, both pro-
grams were unconstitutional because the state supervision necessary
to ensure a secular purpose and a secular effect inevitably involved
the state authorities too deeply in the religious affairs of the aided
institutions.92
    Two programs of assistance through the provision of equipment
and services to private, including sectarian, schools were invali-
dated in Meek v. Pittenger.93 First, the loan of instructional mate-
rial and equipment directly to nonpublic elementary and secondary
schools was voided as constituting impermissible assistance to reli-

U.S. 192 (1973), the Court held that a state could reimburse schools for expenses
incurred in reliance on the voided program up to the date the Supreme Court held
the statute unconstitutional. But see New York v. Cathedral Academy, 434 U.S. 125
(1977).

dissented. Id. at 385, 387.
