cated. Of course, unless there is some governmental connection, there
will be no federal constitutional application to any such contro-
versy.643 But, in at least some instances, when government compels
membership in an organization or in some manner lends its author-
ity to such compulsion, there may be constitutional limitations. For
example, such limitations can arise in connection with union shop
labor agreements permissible under the National Labor Relations
Act and the Railway Labor Act.644
     Union shop agreements generally require, as a condition of em-
ployment, membership in the union on or after the thirtieth day
following the beginning of employment. In Railway Employes’ Dep’t
v. Hanson, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such
agreements, noting that the record in the case did not indicate that
union dues were being “used as a cover for forcing ideological con-
formity or other action in contravention of the First Amendment,”
such as by being spent to support political candidates.645 In Inter-
national Ass’n of Machinists v. Street, where union dues had been
collected pursuant to a union shop agreement and had been spent
to support political candidates, the Court avoided the First Amend-
ment issue by construing the Railway Labor Act to prohibit the use
of compulsory union dues for political causes.646




     643 The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 537,

29 U.S.C. §§ 411–413, enacted a bill of rights for union members, designed to pro-
tect, among other things, freedom of speech and assembly and the right to partici-
pate in union meetings on political and economic subjects.
     644 Section 8(a)(3) of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 140,

29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3), permits the negotiation of union shop agreements. Such agree-
ments, however, may be outlawed by state “right to work” laws. Section 14(b), 61
Stat. 151, 29 U.S.C. § 164(b). See Lincoln Fed. Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron &
Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525 (1949); AFL v. American Sash & Door Co., 335 U.S. 538
(1949). In industries covered by the Railway Labor Act, union shop agreements may
be negotiated regardless of contrary state laws. 64 Stat. 1238, 45 U.S.C. § 152, Elev-
enth; see Railway Employes’ Dep’t v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956).
     645 351 U.S. 225, 238 (1956).
     646 367 U.S. 740, 749–50 (1961). Justices Douglas, Black, Frankfurter, and Har-

lan would have reached the constitutional issue, with differing results. On the same
day that it decided Street, the Court, in Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U.S. 820 (1961),
declined to reach the constitutional issues presented by roughly the same fact situ-
ation in a suit by lawyers compelled to join an “integrated bar.” These issues, how-
ever, were faced squarely in Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 14 (1990),
which held that an integrated state bar may not, against a members’ wishes, devote
compulsory dues to ideological or other political activities not “necessarily or reason-
ably related to the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the qual-
ity of legal service available to the people of the State.”
