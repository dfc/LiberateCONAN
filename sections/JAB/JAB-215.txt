request by a cable subscriber, a cable operator, without charge, fully
scramble or otherwise fully block any channel to which a sub-

Government Restraint of Content of Expression
     As a general matter, government may not regulate speech “be-
cause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its con-
tent.” 1123 “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of
its content will ever be permissible.” 1124 Invalid content regulation
includes not only restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also pro-
hibitions on public discussion of an entire topic.1125 Although, as dis-
cussed below, there are certain categories of speech that fall out-
side of First Amendment scrutiny, such as obscenity or defamation,
the Court is generally reluctant to add new exceptions.1126 The Court
has suggested that while new categories of unprotected speech may

The distinction between, on the one hand, directly regulating, and, on the other hand,
incidentally affecting, the content of expression was sharply drawn by Justice Har-
lan in Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36, 49–51 (1961): “Through-
out its history this Court has consistently recognized at least two ways in which
constitutionally protected freedom of speech is narrower than an unlimited license
to talk. On the one hand, certain forms of speech, or speech in certain contexts, has
been considered outside the scope of constitutional protection. . . . On the other hand,
general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of speech but inci-
dentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type of law
the First or Fourteenth Amendments forbade Congress or the States to pass, when
they have been found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests, a pre-
requisite to constitutionality which has necessarily involved a weighing of the gov-
ernmental interest involved.” The Court set forth the test for “incidental limitations
on First Amendment freedoms” in United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968).
