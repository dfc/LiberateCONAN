office.874 The Court had previously passed on several opportunities
to assess this restriction,875 and one of the dissents in Bellotti noted
the potential conflict.876 While the dissent’s concerns were ulti-
mately realized in Citizens United v. FEC,877 it was only after many
years of the Court either distinguishing Bellotti or applying it nar-
rowly.
     During that interim, the Court first considered challenges to dif-
ferent aspects of the federal statute and to related state statutes,
upholding some restrictions on corporate electoral activities, but lim-
iting others. In FEC v. National Right to Work Committee,878 the
Court considered the operation of “separate segregated funds” (in
common parlance, a Political Action Committee or “PAC”), through
which, according to federal law, corporations can engage in speci-
fied political activities. The Court unanimously upheld a prohibi-
tion on a corporation soliciting money from other corporations for a
PAC in order to make contributions or expenditures in relation to
federal elections. Relying on Bellotti for the proposition that the gov-
ernment may act to prevent “both actual corruption and the appear-
ance of corruption of elected representatives,” the Court saw no rea-
son that Congress could not, in its legislative judgment, treat unions,
corporations, and similar organizations differently from individu-
als.879
     However, an exception to this general principle was recognized
by a divided Court in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,880
holding the section’s requirement that independent expenditures be
     874 2 U.S.C. § 441b. The provision began as § 313 of the Federal Corrupt Prac-

tices Act of 1925, 43 Stat. 1074, prohibiting contributions by corporations. It was
made temporarily applicable to labor unions in the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943,
57 Stat. 167, and became permanently applicable in § 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act.
61 Stat. 159.
     875 All three cases involved labor unions and were decided on the basis of statu-

tory interpretation, apparently informed with some constitutional doubts. United States
v. CIO, 335 U.S. 106 (1948); United States v. United Automobile Workers, 352 U.S.
567 (1957); Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U.S. 385 (1972).
     876 Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 811–12 (Justice White dissenting). The majority opin-

ion, however, saw several distinctions between the federal law and the law at issue
in Bellotti. The Court emphasized that Bellotti was a referendum case, not a case
involving corporate expenditures in the context of partisan candidate elections, in
which the problem of corruption of elected representatives was a weighty problem.
“Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or
apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candi-
date elections.” Id. at 787–88 & n.26.

Justices Marshall, Powell, O’Connor, and Scalia; Chief Justice Rehnquist, author of
the Court’s opinion in National Right to Work Comm., dissented from the constitu-
tional ruling, and was joined by Justices White, Blackmun, and Stevens.
