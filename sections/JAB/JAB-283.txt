     Leafleting, Handbilling, and the Like.—In Lovell v. City of
Griffin,1499 the Court struck down a permit system applying to the
distribution of circulars, handbills, or literature of any kind. The
First Amendment, the Court said, “necessarily embraces pam-
phlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the
defense of liberty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in
our own history abundantly attest.” 1500 State courts, responding to
what appeared to be a hint in Lovell that prevention of littering
and other interests might be sufficient to sustain a flat ban on lit-
erature distribution,1501 upheld total prohibitions and were re-
versed. “Mere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting matters
of public convenience may well support regulation directed at other
personal activities, but be insufficient to justify such as diminishes
the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic in-
stitutions . . . . We are of the opinion that the purpose to keep the
streets clean and of good appearance is insufficient to justify an or-
dinance which prohibits a person rightfully on a public street from
handing literature to one willing to receive it. Any burden imposed
upon the city authorities in cleaning and caring for the streets as
an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the consti-
tutional protection of the freedom of speech and press.” 1502 In Tal-
ley v. California,1503 the Court struck down an ordinance that banned
all handbills that did not carry the name and address of the au-
thor, printer, and sponsor; conviction for violating the ordinance was
set aside on behalf of one distributing leaflets urging boycotts against
certain merchants because of their employment discrimination. The
basis of the decision is not readily ascertainable. On the one hand,
the Court celebrated anonymity. “Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets,
brochures and even books have played an important role in the prog-
ress of mankind. Persecuted groups and sects from time to time
throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices
and laws either anonymously or not at all . . . . [I]dentification and
fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public

     1502 Schneider v. Town of Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 161, 162 (1939). The Court

noted that the right to distribute leaflets was subject to certain obvious regulations,
id. at 160, and called for a balancing, with the weight inclined to the First Amend-
ment rights. See also Jamison v. Texas, 318 U.S. 413 (1943).
