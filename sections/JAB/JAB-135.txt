tion of access to NLRB processes by any union that each of its offi-
cers must file affidavits that he was not a member of the Commu-
nist Party or affiliated with it.691 The Court has sustained state bar
associations in their efforts to probe into applicants’ membership in
the Communist Party in order to determine whether there was know-
ing membership on the part of one sharing a specific intent to fur-
ther the illegal goals of the organization.692 A section of the Commu-
nist Control Act of 1954 was designed to keep the Communist Party
off the ballot in all elections.693 The most recent interpretation of
this type of disability is United States v. Robel,694 in which the Court
held unconstitutional under the First Amendment a section of the
Internal Security Act that made it unlawful for any member of an
organization compelled to register as a “Communist-action” or
“Communist-front” organization to work in any defense facility. For
the Court, Chief Justice Warren wrote that a statute that so in-
fringed upon freedom of association must be much more narrowly
drawn to take precise account of the evils at which it permissibly
could be aimed. One could be disqualified from holding sensitive po-
sitions on the basis of active, knowing membership with a specific
intent to further the unlawful goals of an organization, but that
membership that was passive or inactive, or by a person unaware
of the organization’s unlawful aims, or by one who disagreed with
those aims, could not be grounds for disqualification, certainly not
for a non-sensitive position.695
     A somewhat different matter is disqualifying a person for pub-
lic benefits of some sort because of membership in a proscribed or-
ganization or because of some other basis ascribable to doubts about
his loyalty. The First Amendment was raised only in dissent when
in Flemming v. Nestor 696 the Court sustained a statute that re-
quired the termination of Social Security old-age benefits to an alien
who was deported on grounds of membership in the Communist Party.
