those used in the public schools.107 Nor was a state permitted to
pay the costs to religious schools of field trip transportation, such
as it did to public school students.108
    The Court’s later decisions, however, rejected the reasoning and
overturned the results of several of these decisions. In two rulings,
the Court reversed course with respect to the constitutionality of
public school personnel’s providing educational services on the prem-
ises of pervasively sectarian schools. First, in Zobrest v. Catalina
Foothills School District 109 the Court held that the public subsidy
of a sign-language interpreter for a deaf student attending a paro-
chial school created no primary effect or entanglement problems.
The payment did not relieve the school of an expense that it would
otherwise have borne, the Court stated, and the interpreter had no
role in selecting or editing the content of any of the lessons. Reviv-
ing the child benefit theory of its earlier cases, the Court wrote:
“The service at issue in this case is part of a general government
program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying
as ‘disabled’ under the IDEA, without regard to the ‘sectarian-
nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child at-
tends.” 110
    Second, and more pointedly, the Court in Agostini v. Felton 111
overturned its decision in Aguilar v. Felton,112 which had struck down
the Title I program as administered in New York City, as well as
the analogous parts of its decisions in Meek v. Pittenger 113 and Grand
Rapids School District v. Ball.114 The assumptions on which those
decisions had rested, the Court stated, had been “undermined” by
its more recent decisions. Decisions such as Zobrest and Witters v.
Washington Department of Social Services,115 it said, had repudi-
ated the notions that the placement of a public employee in a sec-
tarian school creates an “impermissible symbolic link” between gov-
ernment and religion, that “all government aid that directly aids
the educational function of religious schools” is constitutionally for-
bidden, that public teachers in a sectarian school necessarily pose
a serious risk of inculcating religion, and that “pervasive monitor-
ing of [such] teachers is required.” The proper criterion under the
