Beauharnais.1204 In neither case did the Court apply the concept of
Times to void them altogether. Garrison v. Louisiana 1205 held that
a statute that did not incorporate the Times rule of “actual malice”
was invalid, while in Ashton v. Kentucky 1206 a common-law defini-
tion of criminal libel as “any writing calculated to create distur-
bances of the peace, corrupt the public morals or lead to any act,
which, when done, is indictable” was too vague to be constitu-
tional.
     The teaching of Times and the cases following it is that expres-
sion on matters of public interest is protected by the First Amend-
ment. Within that area of protection is commentary about the pub-
lic actions of individuals. The fact that expression contains falsehoods
does not deprive it of protection, because otherwise such expres-
sion in the public interest would be deterred by monetary judg-
ments and self-censorship imposed for fear of judgments. But, over
the years, the Court has developed an increasingly complex set of
standards governing who is protected to what degree with respect
to which matters of public and private interest.
     Individuals to whom the Times rule applies presented one of
the first issues for determination. At times, the Court has keyed it
to the importance of the position held. “There is, first, a strong in-
terest in debate on public issues, and, second, a strong interest in
debate about those persons who are in a position significantly to
influence the resolution of those issues. Criticism of government is
at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free dis-
cussion. Criticism of those responsible for government operations
must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized. It is
clear, therefore, that the ‘public official’ designation applies at the
very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees
who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibil-
ity for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.” 1207 But
this focus seems to have become diffused and the concept of “public
official” has appeared to take on overtones of anyone holding public
elective or appointive office.1208 Moreover, candidates for public of-
