    Modern Tests and Standards: Vagueness, Overbreadth, Strict
Scrutiny, Intermediate Scrutiny, and Effectiveness of Speech
Restrictions.—Vagueness is a due process vice that can be brought
into play with regard to any criminal and many civil statutes,523
but it has a special signficance when applied to governmental re-
strictions of speech: fear that a vague restriction may apply to one’s
speech may deter constitutionally protected speech as well as con-
stitutionally unprotected speech. Vagueness has been the basis for
voiding numerous such laws, especially in the fields of loyalty oaths,524
obscenity and indecency,525 and restrictions on public demonstra-
tions.526 It is usually combined with the overbreadth doctrine, which
focuses on the need for precision in drafting a statute that may af-
fect First Amendment rights; 527 an overbroad statute that sweeps
under its coverage both protected and unprotected speech and con-
duct will normally be struck down as facially invalid, although in a
non-First Amendment situation the Court would simply void its ap-
plication to protected conduct.528
    But, even in a First Amendment situation, the Court has writ-
ten, “there are substantial social costs created by the overbreadth
     523 The vagueness doctrine generally requires that a statute be precise enough

to give fair warning to actors that contemplated conduct is criminal, and to provide
adequate standards to enforcement agencies, factfinders, and reviewing courts. See,
e.g., Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385 (1926); Lanzetta v. New Jersey,
306 U.S. 451 (1939); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979); Village of Hoffman
Estates v. The Flipside, 455 U.S. 489 (1982).
     524 E.g., Cramp v. Board of Pub. Instruction, 368 U.S. 278 (1961); Baggett v.

Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967).
See also Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030 (1991) (attorney discipline,
extrajudicial statements).
     525 E.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wil-

son, 343 U.S. 495 (1952); Interstate Circuit v. City of Dallas, 390 U.S. 676 (1968);
Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 870–874 (1997). In National Endowment for the Arts
v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court held that a “decency” criterion for the award-
ing of grants, which “in a criminal statute or regulatory scheme . . . could raise sub-
stantial vagueness concerns,” was not unconstitutionally vague in the context of a
condition on public subsidy for speech.
     526 E.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940); Gregory v. City of Chi-

cago, 394 U.S. 111 (1969); Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611 (1971). See also
Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974) (flag desecration law); Lewis v. City of New
Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974) (punishment of opprobrious words); Hynes v. Mayor of
Oradell, 425 U.S. 610 (1976) (door-to-door canvassing). For an evident narrowing of
standing to assert vagueness, see Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50, 60
(1976).
     527 NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 432–33 (1963).
     528 E.g., Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290 (1951); Aptheker v. Secretary of State,

378 U.S. 500 (1964); United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967); Zwickler v. Koota,
389 U.S. 241 (1967); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974); Massachu-
setts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989). But see Washington State Grange v. Wash-
ington State Republican Party, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190 (2008) (facial challenge to bur-
den on right of association rejected “where the statute has a ‘plainly legitimate sweep’ ”).
