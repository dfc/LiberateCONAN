character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it
is done. . . . The most stringent protection of free speech would not
protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a
panic. . . . The question in every case is whether the words used
are used in such a nature as to create a clear and present danger
that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has
a right to prevent.”
    Justice Holmes, along with Justice Brandeis, soon went into dis-
sent in their views that the majority of the Court was misapplying
the legal standards thus expressed to uphold suppression of speech
that offered no threat to organized institutions.374 But it was with
the Court’s assumption that the Fourteenth Amendment restrained
the power of the states to suppress speech and press that the doc-
trines developed.375 At first, Holmes and Brandeis remained in dis-
sent, but, in Fiske v. Kansas,376 the Court sustained a First Amend-
ment type of claim in a state case, and in Stromberg v. California,377
voided a state statute on grounds of its interference with free speech.378
State common law was also voided, with the Court in an opinion
by Justice Black asserting that the First Amendment enlarged pro-
tections for speech, press, and religion beyond those enjoyed under
English common law.379
    Development over the years since has been uneven, but by 1964
the Court could say with unanimity: “we consider this case against
the background of a profound national commitment to the principle
that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-
open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and some-
times unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public offi-
cials.” 380 And, in 1969, the Court said that the cases “have fashioned
the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and
free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of

U.S. 616 (1919); Schaefer v. United States, 251 U.S. 466 (1920); Pierce v. United
States, 252 U.S. 239 (1920); United States ex rel. Milwaukee Social Democratic Pub.
Co. v. Burleson, 255 U.S. 407 (1921). A state statute similar to the federal one was
upheld in Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U.S. 325 (1920).
     375 Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925); Whitney v. California, 274 U.S.

357 (1927). The Brandeis and Holmes dissents in both cases were important formu-
lations of speech and press principles.

     377 283 U.S. 359 (1931). By contrast, it was not until 1965 that a federal statute

was held unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Lamont v. Postmaster Gen-
eral, 381 U.S. 301 (1965). See also United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967).

of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 (1938).

victions of newspaper editor and others for publishing commentary on pending cases).
