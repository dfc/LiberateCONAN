arship program.261 Although the state could have included theology
students in its scholarship program without offending the Establish-
ment Clause, its choice “not to fund” religious training did not of-
fend the Free Exercise Clause even though that choice singled out
theology students for exclusion.262 Refusal to fund religious train-
ing, the Court observed, was “far milder” than restrictions on reli-
gious practices that have been held to offend the Free Exercise
Clause.263
     The Belief-Conduct Distinction.—Although the Court has con-
sistently affirmed that the Free Exercise Clause protects religious
beliefs, protection for religiously motivated conduct has waxed and
waned over the years. The Free Exercise Clause “embraces two con-
cepts—freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute,
but in the nature of things, the second cannot be.” 264 In its first
free exercise case, involving the power of government to prohibit
polygamy, the Court invoked a hard distinction between the two,
saying that although laws “cannot interfere with mere religious be-
liefs and opinions, they may with practices.” 265 The rule thus pro-
pounded protected only belief, inasmuch as religiously motivated ac-
tion was to be subjected to the police power of the state to the same
extent as would similar action springing from other motives. The
Reynolds no-protection rule was applied in a number of cases,266
but later cases established that religiously grounded conduct is not

for other professions was permissible, the Court explained, because “[t]raining some-
one to lead a congregation is an essentially religious endeavor,” and the Constitu-
tion’s special treatment of religion finds “no counterpart with respect to other call-
ings or professions.” Id. at 721.

United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605, 625 (1931), suggested a plenary govern-
mental power to regulate action in denying that recognition of conscientious objec-
tion to military service was of a constitutional magnitude, saying that “unqualified
allegiance to the Nation and submission and obedience to the laws of the land, as
well those made for war as those made for peace, are not inconsistent with the will
of God.”

have invariably posed some substantial threat to public safety, peace or order.”
