offensive to “the core rationale underlying the Establishment Clause
[—] preventing ‘a fusion of governmental and religious func-
tions.’ ” 246
    Using somewhat similar reasoning, the Court in Board of Edu-
cation of Kiryas Joel Village v. Grumet,247 invalidated a New York
law creating a special school district for an incorporated village com-
posed exclusively of members of one small religious sect. The stat-
ute failed “the test of neutrality,” the Court concluded, since it del-
egated power “to an electorate defined by common religious belief
and practice, in a manner that fails to foreclose religious favorit-
ism.” It was the “anomalously case-specific nature of the legisla-
ture’s exercise of authority” that left the Court “without any direct
way to review such state action” for conformity with the neutrality
principle. Because the village did not receive its governmental au-
thority simply as one of many communities eligible under a gen-
eral law, the Court explained, there was no way of knowing whether
the legislature would grant similar benefits on an equal basis to
other religious and nonreligious groups.

Free Exercise of Religion
    “The Free Exercise Clause . . . withdraws from legislative power,
state and federal, the exertion of any restraint on the free exercise
of religion. Its purpose is to secure religious liberty in the indi-
vidual by prohibiting any invasions there by civil authority.” 248 It
bars “governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such,” 249 pro-
hibiting misuse of secular governmental programs “to impede the
observance of one or all religions or . . . to discriminate invidiously
between religions . . . even though the burden may be character-
ized as being only indirect.” 250 Freedom of conscience is the basis
of the Free Exercise Clause, and government may not penalize or
discriminate against an individual or a group of individuals be-
cause of their religious views nor may it compel persons to affirm
any particular beliefs.251 Interpretation is complicated, however, by
the fact that exercise of religion usually entails ritual or other prac-
tices that constitute “conduct” rather than pure “belief.” When it
comes to protecting conduct as free exercise, the Court has been
    246 459 U.S. at 126, quoting Abington, 374 U.S. 203, 222 (1963).
    247 512 U.S. 687 (1994). Only four Justices (Souter, Blackmun, Stevens, and
Ginsburg) thought that the Grendel’s Den principle applied; in their view the distinc-
tion that the delegation was to a village electorate rather than to a religious body
“lack[ed] constitutional significance” under the peculiar circumstances of the case.
