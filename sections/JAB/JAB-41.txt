student groups. In Widmar v. Vincent,180 the Court held that allow-
ing student religious groups equal access to a public college’s facili-
ties would further a secular purpose, would not constitute an imper-
missible benefit to religion, and would pose little hazard of
entanglement. Subsequently, the Court held that these principles
apply to public secondary schools as well as to institutions of higher
learning. In 1990, in Westside Community Board of Education v.
Mergens,181 the Court upheld application of the Equal Access Act 182
to prevent a secondary school from denying access to school prem-
ises to a student religious club while granting access to such other
“noncurriculum” related student groups as a scuba diving club, a
chess club, and a service club.183 Justice O’Connor stated in a plu-
rality opinion that “there is a crucial difference between govern-
ment speech endorsing religion and private speech endorsing reli-
gion. We think that secondary school students are mature enough
and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or sup-
port student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory
basis.” 184
     Similarly, public schools may not rely on the Establishment Clause
as grounds to discriminate against religious groups in after-hours
use of school property otherwise available for non-religious social,
civic, and recreational purposes. In Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches
School District,185 the Court held that a school district could not,
consistent with the free speech clause, refuse to allow a religious
group to use school facilities to show a film series on family life
when the facilities were otherwise available for community use. “It
discriminates on the basis of viewpoint,” the Court ruled, “to per-

    181  496 U.S. 226 (1990). The Court had noted in Widmar that university stu-
dents “are less impressionable than younger students and should be able to appreci-
ate that the University’s policy is one of neutrality toward religion,” 454 U.S. at 274
n.14. The Mergens plurality ignored this distinction, suggesting that secondary school
students are also able to recognize that a school policy allowing student religious
groups to meet in school facilities is one of neutrality toward religion. 496 U.S. at

Act requires secondary schools that receive federal financial assistance to allow stu-
dent religious groups to meet in school facilities during noncurricular time to the
same extent as other student groups and had been enacted by Congress in 1984 to
apply the Widmar principles to the secondary school setting.
     183 There was no opinion of the Court on Establishment Clause issues, a plural-

ity of four led by Justice O’Connor applying the three-part Lemon test, and concur-
ring Justices Kennedy and Scalia proposing a less stringent test under which “neu-
tral” accommodations of religion would be permissible as long as they do not in effect
establish a state religion, and as long as there is no coercion of students to partici-
pate in a religious activity.
