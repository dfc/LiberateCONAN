balanced and fair manner.” 1098 The ban on all editorializing was
deemed too severe and restrictive a means of accomplishing the gov-
ernmental purposes—protecting public broadcasting stations from
being coerced, through threat or fear of withdrawal of public fund-
ing, into becoming “vehicles for governmental propagandizing,” and
also keeping the stations “from becoming convenient targets for cap-
ture by private interest groups wishing to express their own parti-
san viewpoints.” 1099 Expression of editorial opinion was described
as a “form of speech . . . that lies at the heart of First Amendment
protection,” 1100 and the ban was said to be “defined solely on the
basis of . . . content,” the assumption being that editorial speech is
speech directed at “controversial issues of public importance.” 1101
Moreover, the ban on editorializing was both overinclusive, apply-
ing to commentary on local issues of no likely interest to Congress,
and underinclusive, not applying at all to expression of controver-
sial opinion in the context of regular programming. Therefore, the
Court concluded, the restriction was not narrowly enough tailored
to fulfill the government’s purposes.
    Sustaining FCC discipline of a broadcaster who aired a record
containing a series of repeated “barnyard” words, considered “inde-
cent” but not obscene, the Court posited a new theory to explain
why the broadcast industry is less entitled to full constitutional pro-
tection than are other communications entities.1102 “First, the broad-
cast media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the
lives of all Americans. Patently offensive, indecent material pre-
sented over the airwaves confronts the citizens, not only in public,
but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual’s right to
be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an
intruder. . . . Second, broadcasting is uniquely accessible to chil-
dren, even those too young to read. . . . The ease with which chil-
dren may obtain access to broadcast material . . . amply justif[ies]
special treatment of indecent broadcasting.” 1103 The Court empha-
sized the “narrowness” of its holding, which “requires consideration

sion that obtained the support of a majority of the Court. In Denver Area Educa-
tional Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 748 (1996), the Court
noted that spectrum scarcity “has little to do with a case that involves the effects of
television viewing on children.”
