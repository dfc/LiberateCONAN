cal views.” 886 Also, the Court concluded that the Chamber of Com-
merce was unlike the MCFL in each of the three distinguishing fea-
tures that had justified an exemption from operation of the federal
law. Unlike MCFL, the Chamber was not organized solely to pro-
mote political ideas; although it had no stockholders, the Cham-
ber’s members had similar disincentives to forgo benefits of mem-
bership in order to protest the Chamber’s political expression; and,
by accepting corporate contributions, the Chamber could serve as a
conduit for corporations to circumvent prohibitions on direct corpo-
rate contributions and expenditures.887
    In FEC v. Beaumont,888 the Court held that the federal law that
bars corporations from contributing directly to candidates for fed-
eral office, but allows contributions though PACs, may constitution-
ally be applied to nonprofit advocacy corporations. The Court in Beau-
mont wrote that, in National Right to Work, it had “specifically rejected
the argument . . . that deference to congressional judgments about
proper limits on corporate contributions turns on details of corpo-
rate form or the affluence of particular corporations.” 889 Though non-
profit advocacy corporations, the Court held in Massachusetts Citi-
zens for Life, have a First Amendment right to make independent
expenditures, the same is not true for direct contributions to candi-
dates.
    In McConnell v. FEC,890 the Court upheld against facial consti-
tutional challenges key provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Re-
form Act of 2002 (BCRA). A majority opinion coauthored by Jus-
tices Stevens and O’Connor upheld two major provisions of BCRA:
(1) the prohibition on “national party committees and their agents
from soliciting, receiving, directing, or spending any soft money,” 891
which is money donated for the purpose of influencing state or lo-
cal elections, or money for “mixed-purpose activities—including get-
out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising,” 892 and (2) the
prohibition on corporations and labor unions’ using funds in their
treasuries to finance “electioneering communications,” 893 which BCRA
defines as “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that
“refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal Office,” made
within 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a pri-
