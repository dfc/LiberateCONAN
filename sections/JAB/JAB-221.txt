and Communist Control Law.” In Brandenburg v. Ohio,1154 a state
criminal syndicalism statute was held unconstitutional because its
condemnation of advocacy of crime, violence, or unlawful methods
of terrorism swept within its terms both mere advocacy as well as
incitement to imminent lawless action. A seizure of books, pam-
phlets, and other documents under a search warrant pursuant to a
state subversives suppression law was struck down under the Fourth
Amendment in an opinion heavy with First Amendment over-
tones.1155
     Fighting Words and Other Threats to the Peace.—In
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,1156 the Court unanimously sus-
tained a conviction under a statute proscribing “any offensive, deri-
sive or annoying word” addressed to any person in a public place
under the state court’s interpretation of the statute as being lim-
ited to “fighting words”—i.e., to words that “have a direct tendency
to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the
remark is addressed.” The statute was sustained as “narrowly drawn
and limited to define and punish specific conduct lying within the
domain of state power, the use in a public place of words likely to
cause a breach of the peace.” 1157 The case is best known for Justice
Murphy’s famous dictum. “[I]t is well understood that the right of
free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circum-
stances. There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd
and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or ‘fight-
ing’ words—those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend
to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well ob-
served that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition
of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that
any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.” 1158
    Chaplinsky still remains viable for the principle that “the States
are free to ban the simple use, without a demonstration of addi-
tional justifying circumstances, of so-called ‘fighting words,’ those
personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary

national security cases was rejected on Fourth Amendment grounds in an opinion
that called attention to the relevance of the First Amendment.
