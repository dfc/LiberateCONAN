adverse or prohibitory effects on religious exercise. That the Court
views the principle as a general one, not limited to criminal laws,
seems evident from its restatement in Church of Lukumi Babalu
Aye v. City of Hialeah: “our cases establish the general proposition
that a law that is neutral and of general application need not be
justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has
the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious prac-
tice.” 334
     Similar rules govern taxation. Under the Court’s rulings in Smith
and Swaggart, religious exemptions from most taxes are a matter
of legislative grace rather than constitutional command, since most
important taxes (e.g., income, property, sales and use) satisfy the
criteria of formal neutrality and general applicability, and are not
license fees that can be viewed as prior restraints on expression.335
The result is equal protection, but not substantive protection, for
religious exercise.336 The Court’s approach also accords less protec-
tion to religiously based conduct than is accorded expressive con-
duct that implicates speech but not religious values.337 On the prac-
tical side, relegation of free exercise claims to the political process
may, as concurring Justice O’Connor warned, result in less protec-
tion for small, unpopular religious sects.338
    It does appear that, despite Smith, the Court is still inclined to
void the application of generally applicable laws to religious con-
duct when the prohibited activity is engaged in, not by an indi-
vidual adherant, but by a religious institution. For instance, in
Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission,339 the Court established a “min-
isterial exception” that precludes the application of employment dis-
crimination laws 340 to claims arising out of an employment relation-

    335 This latter condition derives from the fact that the Court in Swaggart distin-
guished earlier decisions by characterizing them as applying only to flat license fees.
