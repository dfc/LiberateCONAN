tices endorsed the view that beliefs could not be inquired into as a
basis for determining qualifications for admission to the bar; 580 four
Justices endorsed the view that while mere beliefs might not be suf-
ficient grounds to debar one from admission, the states were not
precluded from inquiring into them for purposes of determining
whether one was prepared to advocate violent overthrow of the gov-
ernment and to act on his beliefs.581 The decisive vote in each case
was cast by a single Justice who would not permit denial of admis-
sion based on beliefs alone but would permit inquiry into those be-
liefs to an unspecified extent for purposes of determining that the
required oath to uphold and defend the Constitution could be taken
in good faith.582 Changes in Court personnel following this decision
would seem to leave the questions presented open to further litiga-
tion.

Right of Association
    “It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for
the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of
the ‘liberty’ assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. . . . Of course, it
is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by associa-
tion pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and
state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to
associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.” 583 It appears from the
Court’s opinions that the right of association is derivative from the
First Amendment guarantees of speech, assembly, and petition,584
although it has at times been referred to as an independent free-
dom protected by the First Amendment.585 The doctrine is a fairly
recent construction, the problems associated with it having previ-
ously arisen primarily in the context of loyalty-security investiga-
