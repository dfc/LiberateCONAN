the term “prior restraint” would apply, nor do more than assert that
only in “exceptional cases” would prior restraint be permissible.413
    Nor did subsequent cases substantially illuminate the murky
interior of the doctrine. The doctrine of prior restraint was called
upon by the Court as it struck down restrictions on First Amend-
ment rights, including a series of loosely drawn statutes and ordi-
nances requiring licenses to hold meetings and parades and to dis-
tribute literature, with uncontrolled discretion in the licensor whether
or not to issue them.414 The doctrine that generally emerged was
that permit systems and prior licensing are constitutionally valid
so long as the discretion of the issuing official was limited to ques-
tions of time, place, and manner.415 “[O]nly content-based injunc-
tions are subject to prior restraint analysis.” 416
    The most recent Court encounter with the doctrine in the na-
tional security area occurred when the government attempted to en-
join press publication of classified documents pertaining to the Viet-

    413  283 U.S. at 716.
    414  E.g., Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 (1938); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S.
296 (1940); Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290 (1951); Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S.
268 (1951); Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313 (1958). For other applications, see
Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233 (1936); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319
U.S. 105 (1943); Follett v. McCormick, 321 U.S. 573 (1944).
     415 Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 (1941); Poulos v. New Hampshire, 345

U.S. 395 (1953). In Carroll v. President & Comm’rs of Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175
(1968), the Court held invalid the issuance of an ex parte injunction to restrain the
holding of a protest meeting, holding that usually notice must be given the parties
to be restrained and an opportunity for them to rebut the contentions presented to
justify the sought-for restraint. In Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402
U.S. 415 (1971), the Court held invalid as a prior restraint an injunction preventing
the petitioners from distributing 18,000 pamphlets attacking respondent’s alleged
“blockbusting” real estate activities; he was held not to have borne the “heavy bur-
den” of justifying the restraint. “No prior decisions support the claim that the inter-
est of an individual in being free from public criticism of his business practices in
pamphlets or leaflets warrants use of the injunctive power of a court. Designating
the conduct as an invasion of privacy . . . is not sufficient to support an injunction
against peaceful distribution of informational literature of the nature revealed by
this record.” Id. at 419–20. See also City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing
Co., 486 U.S. 750 (1988) (ordinance vesting in the mayor unbridled discretion to
grant or deny annual permit for location of newsracks on public property is facially
invalid as prior restraint).
     The necessity of immediate appellate review of orders restraining the exercise
of First Amendment rights was strongly emphasized in National Socialist Party v.
Village of Skokie, 432 U.S. 43 (1977), and seems to explain the Court’s action in
Philadelphia Newspapers v. Jerome, 434 U.S. 241 (1978). But see Moreland v. Sprecher,
443 U.S. 709 (1979) (party can relinquish right to expedited review through failure
to properly request it).

prior restraint is a content-based restriction on speech prior to its occurrence,” id. at

eting and Parading,” infra.
