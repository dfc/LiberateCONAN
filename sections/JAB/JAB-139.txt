on unexplained membership in an organization so advocating with
knowledge of the advocacy.710 With regard to the required list, the
Justice observed that the state courts had interpreted the law to
provide that a person could rebut the presumption attached to his
mere membership.711
    Invalidated the same year was an oath requirement, addressed
to membership in the Communist Party and other proscribed orga-
nizations, which the state courts had interpreted to disqualify from
employment “solely on the basis of organizational membership.” Stress-
ing that membership might be innocent, that one might be un-
aware of an organization’s aims, or that he might have severed a
relationship upon learning of its aims, the Court struck the law down;
one must be or have been a member with knowledge of illegal aims.712
But subsequent cases firmly reiterated the power of governmental
agencies to inquire into the associational relationships of their em-
ployees for purposes of determining fitness and upheld dismissals
for refusal to answer relevant questions.713 In Shelton v. Tucker,714
however, a five-to-four majority held that, although a state could
inquire into the fitness and competence of its teachers, a require-
ment that every teacher annually list every organization to which
he belonged or had belonged in the previous five years was invalid
because it was too broad, bore no rational relationship to the state’s
interests, and had a considerable potential for abuse.
    The Court relied on vagueness when loyalty oaths aimed at
“subversives” next came before it. In Cramp v. Board of Public In-
struction,715 it unanimously held an oath too vague that required
one to swear, inter alia, that “I have not and will not lend my aid,
support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party.” Simi-
larly, in Baggett v. Bullitt,716 the Court struck down two oaths, one
requiring teachers to swear that they “will by precept and example
