fashion, of something like the clear and present danger standard
in advocacy cases, which is the context in which it was first devel-
oped. Thus, in Brandenburg v. Ohio,544 a conviction under a crimi-
nal syndicalism statute of advocating the necessity or propriety of
criminal or terrorist means to achieve political change was re-
versed. The prevailing doctrine developed in the Communist Party
cases was that “mere” advocacy was protected but that a call for
concrete, forcible action even far in the future was not protected
speech and knowing membership in an organization calling for such
action was not protected association, regardless of the probability
of success.545 In Brandenburg, however, the Court reformulated these
and other rulings to mean “that the constitutional guarantees of
free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or pro-
scribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where
such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent law-
less action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” 546 The
Court has not revisited these issues since Brandenburg, so the long-
term significance of the decision is yet to be determined.547

Freedom of Belief
    The First Amendment does not expressly speak in terms of lib-
erty to hold such beliefs as one chooses, but in both the religion
and the expression clauses, it is clear, liberty of belief is the foun-
dation of the liberty to practice what religion one chooses and to
express oneself as one chooses.548 “If there is any fixed star in our
constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can
prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion,

dard has considerable bite, but do not elaborate sufficiently enough to begin filling
in the outlines of the test. Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105 (1973); NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 928 (1982). But see Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 308–09
(1981).
     547 In Stewart v. McCoy, 537 U.S. 993 (2002), Justice Stevens, in a statement

accompanying a denial of certiorari, wrote that, while Brandenburg’s “requirement
that the consequence be ‘imminent’ is justified with respect to mere advocacy, the
same justification does not necessarily adhere to some speech that performs a teach-
ing function. . . . Long range planning of criminal enterprises—which may include
oral advice, training exercises, and perhaps the preparation of written materials—
involve speech that should not be glibly characterized as mere ‘advocacy’ and cer-
tainly may create significant public danger. Our cases have not yet considered whether,
and if so to what extent, the First Amendment protects such instructional speech.”
