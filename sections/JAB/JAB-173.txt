mary election. Electioneering communications thus include both “ex-
press advocacy and so-called issue advocacy.” 894
    As for the soft-money prohibition on national party commit-
tees, the Court applied “the less rigorous scrutiny applicable to con-
tribution limits” 895 and found it “closely drawn to match a suffi-
ciently important interest.” 896 The Court’s decision to use less rigorous
scrutiny, it wrote, “reflects more than the limited burdens they [i.e.,
the contribution restrictions] impose on First Amendment free-
doms. It also reflects the importance of the interests that underlie
contribution limits—interests in preventing ‘both the actual corrup-
tion threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of
public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance
of corruption.’ ” 897
    As for the prohibition on corporations and labor unions’ using
their general treasury funds to finance electioneering communica-
tions, the Court applied strict scrutiny, but found a compelling gov-
ernmental interest in preventing “the corrosive and distorting ef-
fects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with
the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation
to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideals.” 898 These
corrosive and distorting effects result both from express advocacy
and from so-called issue advocacy. The Court also noted that, be-
cause corporations and unions “remain free to organize and admin-
ister segregated funds, or PACs,” for electioneering communica-
tions, the provision was not a complete ban on expression.899 In
response to the argument that the justifications for a ban on ex-
press advocacy did not apply to issue advocacy, the Court found that
the “argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast dur-
ing the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and gen-
eral elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.” 900
    The limitations on electioneering communication, however, soon
faced renewed examination by the Court. In Wisconsin Right to Life,
Inc. v. Federal Election Comm’n (WRTL I),901 the Court vacated a
lower court decision that had denied plaintiffs the opportunity to
bring an as-applied challenge to BCRA’s regulation of electioneer-
ing communications. Subsequently, in Federal Election Commission
