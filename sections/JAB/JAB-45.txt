The exemption itself does not have a principal effect of advancing
religion, the Court concluded, but merely allows churches to ad-
vance religion.201
     Sunday Closing Laws.—The history of Sunday Closing Laws
goes back into United States colonial history and far back into Eng-
lish history.202 Commonly, the laws require the observance of the
Christian Sabbath as a day of rest, although in recent years they
have tended to become honeycombed with exceptions. The Su-
preme Court rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to Sun-
day Closing Laws in McGowan v. Maryland.203 The Court acknowl-
edged that historically the laws had a religious motivation and were
designed to effectuate concepts of Christian theology. However, “[i]n
light of the evolution of our Sunday Closing Laws through the cen-
turies, and of their more or less recent emphasis upon secular con-
siderations, it is not difficult to discern that as presently written
and administered, most of them, at least, are of a secular rather
than of a religious character, and that presently they bear no rela-
tionship to establishment of religion. . . .” 204 “[T]he fact that this
[prescribed day of rest] is Sunday, a day of particular significance
for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achiev-
ing its secular goals. To say that the States cannot prescribe Sun-
day as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago
such laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional
interpretation of hostility to the public welfare rather than one of
mere separation of church and State.” 205 The choice of Sunday as
the day of rest, although originally religious, now reflected simple
legislative inertia or recognition that Sunday was a traditional day
for the choice.206 Valid secular reasons existed for not simply requir-
ing one day of rest and leaving to each individual to choose the day,
     201 “For a law to have forbidden ‘effects’ . . . it must be fair to say that the gov-

ernment itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.” 483
U.S. at 337. Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion suggests that practically any ben-
efit to religion can be “recharacterized as simply ‘allowing’ a religion to better ad-
vance itself,” and that a “necessary second step is to separate those benefits to reli-
gion that constitutionally accommodate the free exercise of religion from those that
provide unjustifiable awards of assistance to religious organizations.” Id. at 347, 348.
     202 The history is recited at length in the opinion of the Court in McGowan v.

Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 431–40 (1961), and in Justice Frankfurter’s concurrence.

controlled the similar decision on that question in Two Guys from Harrison-
Allentown v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582 (1961), Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599 (1961),
and Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market, 366 U.S. 617 (1961). On free exer-
