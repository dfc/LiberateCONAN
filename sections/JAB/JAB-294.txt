for recruiting resulted, in World War I, in imprisonment.1560 Proces-
sions for the presentation of petitions in the United States have
not been particularly successful. In 1894 General Coxey of Ohio or-
ganized armies of unemployed to march on Washington and pres-
ent petitions, only to see their leaders arrested for unlawfully walk-
ing on the grass of the Capitol. The march of the veterans on
Washington in 1932 demanding bonus legislation was defended as
an exercise of the right of petition. The Administration, however,
regarded it as a threat against the Constitution and called out the
army to expel the bonus marchers and burn their camps. Marches
and encampments have become more common since, but the re-
sults have been mixed.
    The Cruikshank Case.—The right of assembly was first be-
fore the Supreme Court in 1876 1561 in the famous case of United
States v. Cruikshank.1562 The Enforcement Act of 1870 1563 forbade
conspiring or going onto the highways or onto the premises of an-
other to intimidate any other person from freely exercising and en-
joying any right or privilege granted or secured by the Constitution
of the United States. Defendants had been indicted under this Act
on charges of having deprived certain citizens of their right to as-
semble together peaceably with other citizens “for a peaceful and
lawful purpose.” Although the Court held the indictment inad-
equate because it did not allege that the attempted assembly was
for a purpose related to the Federal Government, its dicta broadly
declared the outlines of the right of assembly. “The right of the people
peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a
redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the pow-
ers or the duties of the National Government, is an attribute of na-
tional citizenship, and, as such, under the protection of, and guar-
anteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government,
republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet
peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to peti-
tion for a redress of grievances. If it had been alleged in these counts
that the object of the defendants was to prevent a meeting for such
a purpose, the case would have been within the statute, and within
the scope of the sovereignty of the United States.” 1564 Absorption

Court gave as one of its reasons for striking down a tax on persons leaving the state
its infringement of the right of every citizen to come to the seat of government and
to transact any business he might have with it.
