within the confines of the judicial process, than by announcing dog-
mas too inflexible for the non-Euclidian problems to be solved.” 493
But the “careful weighing of conflicting interests” 494 not only placed
in the scale the disparately weighed interest of government in self-
preservation and the interest of defendants in advocating illegal ac-
tion, which alone would have determined the balance, it also in-
volved the Justice’s philosophy of the “confines of the judicial process”
within which the role of courts, in First Amendment litigation as
in other, is severely limited. Thus, “[f]ull responsibility” may not be
placed in the courts “to balance the relevant factors and ascertain
which interest in the circumstances [is] to prevail.” “Courts are not
representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of
a democratic society.” Rather, “[p]rimary responsibility for adjust-
ing the interests which compete in the situation before us of neces-
sity belongs to the Congress.” 495 Therefore, after considering at some
length the factors to be balanced, Justice Frankfurter concluded:
“It is not for us to decide how we would adjust the clash of inter-
ests which this case presents were the primary responsibility for
reconciling it ours. Congress has determined that the danger cre-
ated by advocacy of overthrow justifies the ensuing restriction on
freedom of speech. The determination was made after due delibera-
tion, and the seriousness of the congressional purpose is attested
by the volume of legislation passed to effectuate the same ends.” 496
Only if the balance struck by the legislature is “outside the pale of
fair judgment” 497 could the Court hold that Congress was deprived
by the Constitution of the power it had exercised.498
     Thereafter, during the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Court used
the balancing test in a series of decisions in which the issues were
not, as they were not in Douds and Dennis, matters of expression
or advocacy as a threat but rather were governmental inquiries into
associations and beliefs of persons or governmental regulation of
associations of persons, based on the idea that beliefs and associa-
tions provided adequate standards for predicting future or in-
tended conduct that was within the power of government to regu-
late or to prohibit. Thus, in the leading case on balancing, Konigsberg
v. State Bar of California,499 the Court upheld the refusal of the
state to certify an applicant for admission to the bar. Required to
satisfy the Committee of Bar Examiners that he was of “good moral
