issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may
well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp
attacks on government and public officials.” 1198 Because the adver-
tisement was “an expression of grievance and protest on one of the
major public issues of our time, [it] would seem clearly to qualify
for the constitutional protection . . . [unless] it forfeits that protec-
tion by the falsity of some of its factual statements and by its al-
leged defamation of respondent.” 1199
     Erroneous statement is protected, the Court asserted, there be-
ing no exception “for any test of truth.” Error is inevitable in any
free debate and to place liability upon that score, and especially to
place on the speaker the burden of proving truth, would introduce
self-censorship and stifle the free expression which the First Amend-
ment protects.1200 Nor would injury to official reputation afford a
warrant for repressing otherwise free speech. Public officials are sub-
ject to public scrutiny and “[c]riticism of their official conduct does
not lose its constitutional protection merely because it is effective
criticism and hence diminishes their official reputation.” 1201 That
neither factual error nor defamatory content could penetrate the pro-
tective circle of the First Amendment was the “lesson” to be drawn
from the great debate over the Sedition Act of 1798, which the Court
reviewed in some detail to discern the “central meaning of the First
Amendment.” 1202 Thus, it appears, the libel law under consider-
ation failed the test of constitutionality because of its kinship with
seditious libel, which violated the “central meaning of the First Amend-
ment.” “The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal
rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a
defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves
that the statement was made with ‘actual malice’—that is, with knowl-
edge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was
false or not.” 1203
    In the wake of the Times ruling, the Court decided two cases
involving the type of criminal libel statute upon which Justice Frank-
furter had relied in analogy to uphold the group libel law in

    1198  376 U.S. at 269, 270.
    1199  376 U.S. at 271.
     1200 376 U.S. at 271–72, 278–79. Of course, the substantial truth of an utter-

ance is ordinarily a defense to defamation. See Masson v. New Yorker Magazine,
501 U.S. 496, 516 (1991).
     1201 376 U.S. at 272–73.
     1202 376 U.S. at 273.
     1203 376 U.S. at 279–80. The same standard applies for defamation contained in

petitions to the government, the Court having rejected the argument that the peti-
tion clause requires absolute immunity. McDonald v. Smith, 472 U.S. 479 (1985).
