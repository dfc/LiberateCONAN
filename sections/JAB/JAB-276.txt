law prevented the chain from hiring blacks on a quota basis, pick-
eting to coerce the adoption of racially discriminatory hiring was
contrary to state public policy.1458
    A series of civil rights picketing and parading cases led the Court
to formulate standards much like those it has established in the
labor field, but more protective of expressive activity. The process
began with Edwards v. South Carolina,1459 in which the Court re-
versed a breach of the peace conviction of several blacks for their
refusal to disperse as ordered by police. The statute was so vague,
the Court concluded, that demonstrators could be convicted simply
because their presence “disturbed” people. Describing the demon-
stration upon the grounds of the legislative building in South Caro-
lina’s capital, Justice Stewart observed that “[t]he circumstances in
this case reflect an exercise of these basic [First Amendment] con-
stitutional rights in their most pristine and classic form.” 1460 In sub-
sequent cases, the Court observed: “We emphatically reject the no-
tion urged by appellant that the First and Fourteenth Amendments
afford the same kind of freedom to those who would communicate
ideas by conduct such as patrolling, marching, and picketing on streets
and highways, as those amendments afford to those who communi-
cate ideas by pure speech.” 1461 “The conduct which is the subject to
this statute—picketing and parading—is subject to regulation even
though intertwined with expression and association. The examples
are many of the application by this Court of the principle that cer-
tain forms of conduct mixed with speech may be regulated or pro-
hibited.” 1462
    The Court must determine, of course, whether the regulation is
aimed primarily at conduct, as is the case with time, place, and
manner regulations, or whether instead the aim is to regulate the
content of speech. In a series of decisions, the Court refused to per-
mit restrictions on parades and demonstrations, and reversed con-
victions imposed for breach of the peace and similar offenses, when,
in the Court’s view, disturbance had resulted from opposition to the
messages being uttered by demonstrators.1463 Subsequently, how-
     1458 Hughes v. Superior Court, 339 U.S. 460 (1950). This ruling, allowing content-

based restriction, seems inconsistent with NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware, discussed
under this topic, infra.
