Court resolves this issue with reference to aggregate effects, and
does not limit its consideration to effects on the challenging liti-
gant.1040
    Fourth, if the governmental interest could be served as well by
a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive re-
striction cannot survive.1041 The Court has rejected the idea that a
“least restrictive means” test is required. Instead, what is now re-
quired is a reasonable “fit” between means and ends, with the means
“narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.” 1042 The Court,
however, does “not equate this test with the less rigorous obstacles
of rational basis review; . . . the existence of ‘numerous and obvi-
ous less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial
speech . . . is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether
the “fit” between ends and means is reasonable.’ ” 1043
    The “reasonable fit” standard has some teeth, the Court made
clear in City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.,1044 striking
     1040 United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 427 (1993) (“this ques-

tion cannot be answered by limiting the inquiry to whether the governmental inter-
est is directly advanced as applied to a single person or entity”).
     1041 Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 565, 569–71 (1980).

This test is, of course, the “least restrictive means” standard. Shelton v. Tucker, 364
U.S. 479, 488 (1960). In Central Hudson, the Court found the ban more extensive
than was necessary to effectuate the governmental purpose. See also Bolger v. Youngs
Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), where the Court held that the governmen-
tal interest in not interfering with parental efforts at controlling children’s access to
birth control information could not justify a ban on commercial mailings about birth
control products; “[t]he level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be lim-
ited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox.” Id. at 74. See also Rubin v.
Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995) (there are less intrusive alternatives—e.g.,
direct limitations on alcohol content of beer—to prohibition on display of alcohol con-
tent on beer label). Note, however, that, in San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v.
United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 539 (1987), the Court applied the test
in a manner deferential to Congress: “the restrictions [at issue] are not broader than
Congress reasonably could have determined to be necessary to further these inter-
ests.”
     1042 Board of Trustees v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989). In a 1993 opinion the

Court elaborated on the difference between reasonable fit and least restrictive alter-
native. “A regulation need not be ‘absolutely the least severe that will achieve the
desired end,’ but if there are numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives to
the restriction . . . , that is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether
the ‘fit’ between ends and means is reasonable.” City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Net-
work, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 417 n.13 (1993). But see Thompson v. Western States Medi-
cal Center, 535 U.S. 357, 368 (2002), in which the Court quoted the fourth prong of
the Central Hudson test without mentioning its reformulation by Fox, and added,
again without reference to Fox, “In previous cases addressing this final prong of the
Central Hudson test, we have made clear that if the government could achieve its
interests in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts less speech, the
government must do so.” Id. at 371.
     1043 Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 632 (1995).
     1044 507 U.S. 410 (1993). See also Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761 (1993), de-

cided the same Term, relying on the “directly advance” third prong of Central Hud-
son to strike down a ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants.
