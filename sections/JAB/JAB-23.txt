one sectarian enterprise”; and “the programs in effect subsidize the
religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substan-
tial portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.” 99
In Aguilar v. Felton,100 the Court invalidated a program under which
public school employees provided instructional services on paro-
chial school premises to educationally deprived children. The pro-
gram differed from those at issue in Grand Rapids because the classes
were closely monitored for religious content. This “pervasive moni-
toring” did not save the program, however, because, by requiring
close cooperation and day-to-day contact between public and secu-
lar authorities, the monitoring “infringes precisely those Establish-
ment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive en-
tanglement.” 101
    A state program to reimburse nonpublic schools for a variety of
services mandated by state law was voided because the statute did
not distinguish between secular and potentially religious services,
the costs of which the state would reimburse.102 Similarly, a pro-
gram of direct monetary grants to nonpublic schools to be used for
the maintenance of school facilities and equipment failed to sur-
vive the primary effect test because it did not restrict payment to
those expenditures related to the upkeep of facilities used exclu-
sively for secular purposes and because “within the context of these
religion-oriented institutions” the Court could not see how such re-
strictions could effectively be imposed.103 But a plan of direct mon-

    100   473 U.S. 402 (1985). This was another 5–4 decision, with Justice Brennan’s
opinion of the Court being joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, and Ste-

dissenting.

      102 Levitt v. Committee for Public Educ. & Religious Liberty, 413 U.S. 472 (1973).

Justice White dissented, id. at 482. The most expensive service to be reimbursed for
nonpublic schools was the “administration, grading and the compiling and reporting
of the results of tests and examinations.” Id. at 474–75. In New York v. Cathedral
Academy, 434 U.S. 125 (1977), the Court struck down a new statutory program en-
titling private schools to obtain reimbursement for expenses incurred during the school
year in which the prior program was voided in Levitt.
      103 Committee for Pub. Educ. and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756,

774–80 (1973). Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist concurred, id. at 798,
and Justice White dissented, id. at 820.
