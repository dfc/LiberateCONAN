regarding his services is not . . . a fundamental right.” 567 Regard-
ing compelled labeling of foreign political propaganda, the Court up-
held a provision of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 that
required that, when an agent of a foreign principal seeks to dissemi-
nate foreign “political propaganda,” he must label such material with
certain information, including his identity, the principal’s identity,
and the fact that he has registered with the Department of Justice.
The Court found that “Congress did not prohibit, edit, or restrain
the distribution of advocacy materials. . . . To the contrary, Con-
gress simply required the disseminators of such material to make
additional disclosures that would better enable the public to evalu-
ate the import of the propaganda.” 568
    Imposition of Consequences for Holding Certain Beliefs.—
Despite the Cantwell dictum that freedom of belief is absolute,569
government has been permitted to inquire into the holding of cer-
tain beliefs and to impose consequences on the believers, primarily
with regard to its own employees and to licensing certain profes-
sions.570 It is not clear what precise limitations the Court has placed
on these practices.
    In its disposition of one of the first cases concerning the federal
loyalty-security program, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia asserted broadly that “so far as the Constitution is con-
cerned there is no prohibition against dismissal of Government em-
ployees because of their political beliefs, activities or affilia-
tions.” 571 On appeal, this decision was affirmed by an equally divided
Court, its being impossible to determine whether this issue was one

     570 The issue has also arisen in the context of criminal sentencing. Evidence that

racial hatred was a motivation for a crime may be taken into account, Barclay v.
Florida, 463 U.S. 939, 949 (1983); Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993) (crimi-
nal sentence may be enhanced because the defendant intentionally selected his vic-
tim on account of the victim’s race), but evidence of the defendant’s membership in
a racist group is inadmissible where race was not a factor and no connection had
been established between the defendant’s crime and the group’s objectives. Dawson
v. Delaware, 503 U.S. 159 (1992). See also United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45 (1984)

belonged to group whose members were sworn to lie on each other’s behalf).
     571 Bailey v. Richardson, 182 F.2d 46 (D.C. Cir. 1950). The premise of the deci-

sion was that government employment is a privilege rather than a right and that
access thereto may be conditioned as the government pleases. But this basis, as the
Court has said, “has been thoroughly undermined in the ensuing years.” Board of
Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 571 n.9 (1972). For the vitiation of the right-
privilege distinction, see “Government as Employer: Free Speech Generally,” infra.
