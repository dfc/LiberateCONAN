Amendment because it forced schools to choose between enforcing
their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters and con-
tinuing to receive specified federal funding. The Court concluded:
“Because the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from
directly imposing the Solomon Amendment’s access requirement, the
statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt
of federal funds.” 1005 The Court found that “[t]he Solomon Amend-
ment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires them to
say anything. . . . It affects what law schools must do—afford equal
access to military recruiters—not what they may or may not say.” 1006
The law schools’ conduct in barring military recruiters, the Court
found, “is not inherently expressive,” and, therefore, unlike flag burn-
ing, for example, is not “symbolic speech.” 1007 Applying the O’Brien
test for restrictions on conduct that have an incidental effect on speech,
the Court found that the Solomon Amendment clearly “promotes a
substantial government interest that would be achieved less effec-
tively absent the regulation.” 1008
    The Court also found that the Solomon Amendment did not un-
constitutionally compel schools to speak, or even to host or accom-
modate the government’s message. As for compelling speech, law
schools must “send e-mails and post notices on behalf of the mili-
tary to comply with the Solomon Amendment. . . . This sort of re-
cruiting assistance, however, is a far cry from the compelled speech
in Barnette and Wooley. . . . [It] is plainly incidental to the Solo-
mon Amendment’s regulation of conduct.” 1009 As for forcing one speaker
to host or accommodate another, “[t]he compelled-speech violation
in each of our prior cases . . . resulted from the fact that the com-
plaining speaker’s own message was affected by the speech it was
forced to accommodate.” 1010 By contrast, the Court wrote, “Nothing
about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech
by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amendment restricts what
the law schools may say about the military’s policies.” 1011 Finally,
the Court found that the Solomon Amendment was not analogous
to the New Jersey law that had required the Boy Scouts to accept
a homosexual scoutmaster, and that the Supreme Court struck down

     1005 547 U.S. at 60. The Court stated that Congress’s authority to directly re-

quire campus access for military recruiters comes from its Article I, section 8, pow-
ers to provide for the common defense, to raise and support armies, and to provide
and maintain a navy. Id. at 58.
