tion will prevail.47 On the other hand, a court confronted with a
church property dispute could apply “neutral principles of law, de-
veloped for use in all property disputes,” when to do so would not
require resolution of doctrinal issues.48 In a 1976 case, the Court
elaborated on the limits of proper inquiry, holding that an argu-
ment over a matter of internal church government—the power to
reorganize the dioceses of a hierarchical church in this country—
was “at the core of ecclesiastical affairs” and a court could not inter-
pret the church constitution to make an independent determina-
tion of the power but must defer to the interpretation of the church
body authorized to decide.49
    In Jones v. Wolf,50 however, a divided Court, while formally ad-
hering to these principles, appeared to depart in substance from their
application. A schism had developed in a local church that was a
member of a hierarchical church, and the majority voted to with-
draw from the general church. The proper authority of the general
church determined that the minority constituted the “true congre-
gation” of the local church and awarded them authority over it. But
rather than requiring deference to the decision of the church body,
the Court approved the approach of the state court in applying neu-
tral principles by examining the deeds to the church property, state
statutes, and provisions of the general church’s constitution concern-
ing ownership and control of church property in order to determine
that no language of trust in favor of the general church was con-
tained in any of them and that the property thus belonged to the
local congregational majority.51 Further, the Court held, the First
Amendment did not prevent the state court from applying a pre-

of God at Sharpsburg, 396 U.S. 367 (1970). For a similar rule of neutrality in an-
other context, see United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944) (denying defendant
charged with mail fraud through dissemination of purported religious literature the
right to present to the jury evidence of the truthfulness of the religious views he
urged).

     49 The Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Dionisije Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 697,

720–25 (1976). In Gonzalez v. Archbishop, 280 U.S. 1 (1929), the Court had permit-
ted limited inquiry into the legality of the actions taken under church rules. In Ser-
bian Eastern the Court disapproved of this inquiry with respect to concepts of “arbi-
trariness,” although it reserved decision on the “fraud” and “collusion” exceptions.
