adopted in Feiner v. New York,466 in which Chief Justice Vinson said
that “[t]he findings of the state courts as to the existing situation
and the imminence of greater disorder coupled with petitioner’s de-
liberate defiance of the police officers convince us that we should
not reverse this conviction in the name of free speech.”
     Contempt of Court and Clear and Present Danger.—The
period during which clear and present danger was the standard by
which to determine the constitutionality of governmental suppres-
sion of or punishment for expression was a brief one, extending roughly
from Thornhill to Dennis.467 But in one area it was vigorously, though
not without dispute, applied to enlarge freedom of utterance and it
is in this area that it remains viable. In early contempt-of-court cases
in which criticism of courts had been punished as contempt, the
Court generally took the position that, even if freedom of speech
and press was protected against governmental abridgment, a publi-
cation tending to obstruct the administration of justice was punish-
able, irrespective of its truth.468 In Bridges v. California,469 how-
ever, in which contempt citations had been brought against a
newspaper and a labor leader for statements made about pending
judicial proceedings, Justice Black, for a five-to-four majority, be-
gan by applying the clear and present danger test, which he inter-
preted to require that “the substantive evil must be extremely seri-
ous and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances
can be punished.” 470 He noted that “[t]he substantive evil here sought
to be averted . . . appears to be double: disrespect for the judiciary;
and disorderly and unfair administration of justice.” As for the first
evil, Justice Black rejected “[t]he assumption that respect for the
judiciary can be won by shielding judges from published criticism
. . . .” 471 As for “[t]he other evil feared, disorderly and unfair ad-
ministration of justice, [it] is more plausibly associated with restrict-
ing publications which touch upon pending litigation.” But the “de-
gree of likelihood” of the evil being accomplished was not “sufficient
to justify summary punishment.” 472 In dissent, Justice Frankfurter
accepted the application of the clear and present danger, but he in-
terpreted it as meaning no more than a “reasonable tendency” test.
