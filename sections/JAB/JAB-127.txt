    In Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Education,647 the Court found Hanson
and Street applicable to the public employment context.648 Recogniz-
ing that any system of compelled support restricted employees’ right
not to associate and not to support, the Court nonetheless found
the governmental interests served by an “agency shop” agreement 649—
the promotion of labor peace and stability of employer-employee re-
lations—to be of overriding importance and to justify the impact
upon employee freedom.650 But the Court drew a different balance
when it considered whether employees compelled to support the union
were constitutionally entitled to object to the use of those exacted
funds to support political candidates or to advance ideological causes
not germane to the union’s duties as collective-bargaining represen-
tative. To compel one to expend funds in such a way is to violate
his freedom of belief and the right to act on those beliefs just as
much as if government prohibited him from acting to further his
own beliefs.651 The remedy, however, was not to restrain the union
from making non-collective-bargaining-related expenditures, but was
to require that those funds come only from employees who do not
object. Therefore, the lower courts were directed to oversee develop-
ment of a system under which employees could object generally to
such use of union funds and could obtain either a proportionate re-
fund or a reduction of future exactions.652 Later, the Court further
tightened the requirements. A proportionate refund is inadequate
because “even then the union obtains an involuntary loan for pur-

    648  That a public entity was the employer and the employees consequently were
public employees was deemed constitutionally immaterial for the application of the
principles of Hanson and Street, id. at 226–32, but, in a concurring opinion joined
by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell found the distinction
between public and private employment crucial. Id. at 244.
     649 An agency shop agreement requires all employees, regardless of union mem-

bership, to pay a fee to the union that reflects the union’s efforts in obtaining em-
ployment benefits through collective bargaining. The Court in Abood noted that it is
the “practical equivalent” of a union shop agreement. 431 U.S. at 217 n.10.
     650 431 U.S. at 217–23. For a similar argument over the issue of corporate po-

litical contributions and shareholder rights, see First National Bank v. Bellotti, 435
U.S. 765, 792–95 (1978), and id. at 802, 812–21 (Justice White dissenting).
     651 431 U.S. at 232–37.
     652 431 U.S. at 237–42. On the other hand, nonmembers may be charged for

such general union expenses as contributions to state and national affiliates, ex-
penses of sending delegates to state and national union conventions, and costs of a
union newsletter. Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Ass’n, 500 U.S. 507 (1991). A local union
may also charge nonmembers a fee that goes to the national union to pay for litiga-
tion expenses incurred on behalf of other local units, but only if (1) the litigation is
related to collective bargaining rather than political activity, and (2) the litigation
charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., other locals contribute similarly. Locke v. Karass,
129 S. Ct. 798, 802 (2009).
