always outside the protection of the Free Exercise Clause.267 In-
stead, the Court began to balance the secular interest asserted by
the government against the claim of religious liberty asserted by
the person affected; only if the governmental interest was “compel-
ling” and if no alternative forms of regulation would serve that in-
terest was the claimant required to yield.268 Thus, although free-
dom to engage in religious practices was not absolute, it was entitled
to considerable protection.
    Later cases evidence a narrowing of application of the compel-
ling interest test, and a corresponding constriction of the freedom
to engage in religiously motivated conduct. First, the Court pur-
ported to apply strict scrutiny, but upheld the governmental action
anyhow.269 Next, the Court held that the test is inappropriate in
the contexts of military and prison discipline.270 Then, more impor-
tantly, the Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith that “if
prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the object . . . but
merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise
valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.” 271 There-
fore, the Court concluded, the Free Exercise Clause does not pro-
hibit a state from applying generally applicable criminal penalties
to the use of peyote in a religious ceremony, or from denying unem-
ployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of
religious ceremonial use of peyote. Accommodation of such reli-
gious practices must be found in “the political process,” the Court

(1972); cf. Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 607 (1961): “[I]f the State regulates
conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which
is to advance the State’s secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect bur-
den on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means
which do not impose such a burden.”
     268 Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403, 406–09 (1963). In Wisconsin v. Yoder,

406 U.S. 205 (1972), the Court recognized compelling state interests in provision of
public education, but found insufficient evidence that those interests (preparing chil-
dren for citizenship and for self-reliance) would be furthered by requiring Amish chil-
dren to attend public schools beyond the eighth grade. Instead, the evidence showed
that the Amish system of vocational education prepared their children for life in
their self-sufficient communities.
     269 United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982) (holding mandatory participation

in the Social Security system by an Amish employer religiously opposed to such so-
cial welfare benefits to be “indispensable” to the fiscal vitality of the system); Bob
Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 754 (1983) (holding government’s interest in
eradicating racial discrimination in education to outweigh the religious interest of a
private college whose racial discrimination was founded on religious beliefs); and
Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680 (1989) (holding that government has a
compelling interest in maintaining a uniform tax system “free of ‘myriad exceptions
flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs’ ”)
