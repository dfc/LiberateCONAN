not shown to be too pervasively religious—no religious qualifica-
tions existed for faculty or student body, a substantial part of the
student body was not of the religion of the affiliation, and state rules
precluded the use of any state-financed project for religious activi-
ties.146
    The kind of assistance permitted by Tilton and by Hunt v. McNair
seems to have been broadened when the Court sustained a Mary-
land program of annual subsidies to qualifying private institutions
of higher education; the grants were noncategorical but could not
be used for sectarian purposes, a limitation to be policed by the ad-
ministering agency.147 The plurality opinion found a secular pur-
pose; found that the limitation of funding to secular activities was
meaningful,148 since the religiously affiliated institutions were not
so pervasively sectarian that secular activities could not be sepa-
rated from sectarian ones; and determined that excessive entangle-
ment was improbable, given the fact that aided institutions were
not pervasively sectarian. The annual nature of the subsidy was
recognized as posing the danger of political entanglement, but the
plurality thought that the character of the aided institutions—
“capable of separating secular and religious functions”—was more
important.149

     146 413 U.S. at 743–44. Justices Brennan, Douglas, and Marshall, dissenting,

rejected the distinction between elementary and secondary education and higher edu-
cation and foresaw a greater danger of entanglement than did the Court. Id. at 749.
     147 Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Bd., 426 U.S. 736 (1976). Justice Blackmun’s

plurality opinion was joined only by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell. Jus-
tices White and Rehnquist concurred on the basis of secular purpose and no pri-
mary religious benefit, rejecting entanglement. Id. at 767. Four justices dissented.
     148 426 U.S. at 755. In some of the schools mandatory religion courses were taught,

the significant factor in Justice Stewart’s view, id. at 773, but overweighed by other
factors in the plurality’s view.
     149 426 U.S. at 755–66. The plurality also relied on the facts that the student

body was not local but diverse, and that large numbers of non-religiously affiliated
institutions received aid. A still further broadening of governmental power to ex-
tend aid affecting religious institutions of higher education occurred in several sub-
sequent decisions. First, the Court summarily affirmed two lower-court decisions up-
holding programs of assistance—scholarships and tuitions grants—to students at college
and university as well as vocational programs in both public and private—including
religious—institutions; one of the programs contained no secular use restriction at
all and in the other one the restriction seemed somewhat pro forma. Smith v. Board
of Governors of Univ. of North Carolina, 434 U.S. 803 (1977), aff ’g 429 F. Supp. 871
(W.D.N.C. 1977); Americans United v. Blanton, 434 U.S. 803 (1977), aff ’g 433 F. Supp.
97 (M.D. Tenn. 1977). Second, in Witters v. Washington Dep’t of Services for the
Blind, 474 U.S. 481 (1986), the Court upheld use of a vocational rehabilitation schol-
arship at a religious college, emphasizing that the religious institution received the
public money as a result of the “genuinely independent and private choices of the
aid recipients,” and not as the result of any decision by the state to sponsor or sub-
sidize religion. Third, in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of
Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Court held that a public university cannot ex-
