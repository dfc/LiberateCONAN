of revenues retained in prior charitable solicitations,561 a Florida
statute that required newspapers to grant political candidates equal
space to reply to the newspapers’ criticism and attacks on their re-
cords,562 an Ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of anony-
mous campaign literature,563 and a Massachusetts statute that re-
quired private citizens who organized a parade to include among
the marchers a group imparting a message—in this case support
for gay rights—that the organizers did not wish to convey.564
    The principle of Barnette, however, does not extend so far as to
bar a government from requiring of its employees or of persons seek-
ing professional licensing or other benefits an oath generally but
not precisely based on the oath required of federal officers, which
is set out in the Constitution, that the taker of the oath will up-
hold and defend the Constitution.565 It is not at all clear, however,
to what degree the government is limited in probing the sincerity
of the person taking the oath.566
    By contrast, the Supreme Court has found no First Amend-
ment violation when government compels disclosures in commer-
cial speech, or when it compels the labeling of foreign political pro-
paganda. Regarding compelled disclosures in commercial speech, the
Court held that an advertiser’s “constitutionally protected interest
in not providing any particular factual information in his advertis-
ing is minimal. . . . [A]n advertiser’s rights are reasonably pro-
tected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to
the State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers. . . . The
right of a commercial speaker not to divulge accurate information
