Moreoever, “the regulation distinguishes among the indistinct, per-
mitting a variety of speech that poses the same risks the Govern-
ment purports to fear, while banning messages unlikely to cause
any harm at all.” 1053
     In Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,
the Court asserted that “the greater power to completely ban ca-
sino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertis-
ing of casino gambling.” 1054 Subsequently, however, the Court es-
chewed reliance on Posadas,1055 and it seems doubtful that the Court
would again embrace the broad principle that government may ban
all advertising of an activity that it permits but has power to pro-
hibit. Indeed, the Court’s very holding in 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode
Island,1056 striking down the state’s ban on advertisements that pro-
vide truthful information about liquor prices, is inconsistent with
the general proposition. A Court plurality in 44 Liquormart squarely
rejected Posadas, calling it “erroneous,” declining to give force to
its “highly deferential approach,” and proclaiming that a state “does
not have the broad discretion to suppress truthful, nonmisleading
information for paternalistic purposes that the Posadas majority was
willing to tolerate.” 1057 Four other Justices concluded that Posadas
was inconsistent with the “closer look” that the Court has since re-
quired in applying the principles of Central Hudson.1058
    The “different degree of protection” accorded commercial speech
has a number of consequences as regards other First Amendment
doctrine. For instance, somewhat broader times, places, and man-
ner regulations are to be tolerated,1059 and the rule against prior

     1055 In Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476 (1995) (invalidating a federal

ban on revealing alcohol content on malt beverage labels), the Court rejected reli-
ance on Posadas, pointing out that the statement in Posadas had been made only
after a determination that the advertising could be upheld under Central Hudson.
The Court found it unnecessary to consider the greater-includes-lesser argument in
United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 427 (1993), upholding through
application of Central Hudson principles a ban on broadcast of lottery ads.

     1057 517 U.S. at 510 (opinion of Stevens, joined by Justices Kennedy, Thomas,

and Ginsburg). Stevens’ opinion also dismissed the Posadas “greater-includes-the-
lesser argument” as “inconsistent with both logic and well-settled doctrine,” point-
ing out that the First Amendment “presumes that attempts to regulate speech are
more dangerous than attempts to regulate conduct.” Id. at 511–512.
