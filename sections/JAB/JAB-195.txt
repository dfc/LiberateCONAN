though its nature makes it subject to greater limitations than may
be imposed on expression not solely related to the economic inter-
ests of the speaker and its audience.1016 The change to its earlier
holdings was accomplished within a brief span of time in which the
Justices haltingly but then decisively moved to a new position. Ap-
plying the doctrine in a narrow five-to-four decision, the Court sus-
tained the application of a city’s ban on employment discrimination
to bar sex-designated employment advertising in a newspaper.1017
Suggesting that speech does not lose its constitutional protection
simply because it appears in a commercial context, Justice Powell,
for the Court, did find the placing of want-ads in newspapers to be
“classic examples of commercial speech,” devoid of expressions of
opinions with respect to issues of social policy; so the “did no more
than propose a commercial transaction.” But the Justice also noted
that employment discrimination, which was facilitated by the adver-
tisements, was itself illegal.1018
     Next, the Court overturned a conviction under a state statute
that made it illegal, by sale or circulation of any publication, to en-
courage or prompt the procuring of an abortion. The Court held the
statute unconstitutional as applied to an editor of a weekly newspa-
per who published an advertisement announcing the availability of
legal and safe abortions in another state and detailing the assis-
tance that would be provided state residents in obtaining abortions
in the other state.1019 The Court discerned that the advertisements
conveyed information of other than a purely commercial nature, that
they related to services that were legal in the other jurisdiction,
and that the state could not prevent its residents from obtaining
abortions in the other state or punish them for doing so.
     Then, the Court swept all these distinctions away as it voided
a statute that declared it unprofessional conduct for a licensed phar-
macist to advertise the prices of prescription drugs.1020 In a suit
brought by consumers to protect their right to receive information,
the Court held that speech that does no more than propose a com-
mercial transaction is nonetheless of such social value as to be en-
titled to protection. Consumers’ interests in receiving factual infor-
mation about prices may even be of greater value than political debate,
but in any event price competition and access to information about
