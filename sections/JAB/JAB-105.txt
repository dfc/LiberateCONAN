doctrine when it blocks application of a law to constitutionally un-
protected speech, or especially to constitutionally unprotected con-
duct. To ensure that these costs do now swallow the social benefits
of declaring a law ‘overbroad,’ we have insisted that a law’s applica-
tion to protected speech be ‘substantial,’ not only in an absolute sense,
but also relative to the scope of the law’s plainly legitimate applica-
tions, before applying the ‘strong medicine’ of overbreadth invalida-
tion. . . . Rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed against
a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or
to conduct necessarily associated with speech (such as picketing or
demonstrating).” 529
    Out of a concern that is closely related to that behind the
overbreadth doctrine, the Court has insisted that when the govern-
ment seeks to carry out a permissible goal and it has available a
variety of effective means to do so, “[i]f the First Amendment means
anything, it means that regulating speech must be a last—not first—
resort.” 530 Thus, the Court applies “strict scrutiny” to content-
based regulations of fully protected speech; this means that it re-
quires that such regulations “promote a compelling interest” and
use “the least restrictive means to further the articulated inter-
est.” 531
     With respect to most speech restrictions to which the Court does
not apply strict scrutiny, the Court applies intermediate scrutiny;
i.e., scrutiny that is “midway between the ‘strict scrutiny’ de-
manded for content-based regulation of speech and the ‘rational ba-
sis’ standard that is applied—under the Equal Protection Clause—to

tions omitted) (upholding, as not addressed to speech, an ordinance banning from
streets within a low-income housing development any person who is not a resident
or employee and who “cannot demonstrate a legitimate business or social purpose
for being on the premises”). Virginia v. Hicks cited Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S.
601 (1973), which, in the majority opinion and in Justice Brennan’s dissent, id. at
621, contains extensive discussion of the overbreadth doctrine. Other restrictive de-
cisions include Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 158–64 (1974); Parker v. Levy, 417
U.S. 733, 757–61 (1974); and New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 766–74 (1982). None-
theless, the doctrine continues to be used across a wide spectrum of First Amend-
ment cases. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 815–18 (1975); Erznoznik v. City of
Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975); Doran v. Salem Inn, 422 U.S. 922, 932–34 (1975);
Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 633–39
(1980); Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947 (1984)
(charitable solicitation statute placing 25 percent cap on fundraising expenditures);
City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987) (city ordinance making it unlawful to
“oppose, molest, abuse, or interrupt” police officer in performance of duty); Board of
Airport Comm’rs v. Jews for Jesus, 482 U.S. 569 (1987) (resolution banning all “First
Amendment activities” at airport); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874–879 (1997) (stat-
ute banning “indecent” material on the Internet).
