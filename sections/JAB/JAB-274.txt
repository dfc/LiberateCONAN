anteed by the Constitution. . . .” 1446 The Court further reasoned that
“the group in power at any moment may not impose penal sanc-
tions on peaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public inter-
est merely on a showing that others may thereby be persuaded to
take action inconsistent with its interests. Abridgment of the lib-
erty of such discussion can be justified only where the clear danger
of substantive evils arises under circumstances affording no oppor-
tunity to test the merits of ideas by competition for acceptance in
the market of public opinion.” 1447
     The Court soon recognized several caveats. Peaceful picketing
may be enjoined if it is associated with violence and intimida-
tion.1448 Although initially the Court continued to find picketing pro-
tected in the absence of violence,1449 it soon decided a series of cases
recognizing a potentially far-reaching exception: injunctions against
peaceful picketing in the course of a labor controversy may be en-
joined when such picketing is counter to valid state policies in a
domain open to state regulation.1450 These cases proceeded upon a
distinction drawn by Justice Douglas. “Picketing by an organized
group is more than free speech, since it involves patrol of a particu-
lar locality and since the very presence of a picket line may induce
action of one kind or another, quite irrespective of the nature of
the ideas which are being disseminated. Hence those aspects of pick-
eting make it the subject of restrictive regulations.” 1451 The appar-
ent culmination of this course of decision was the Vogt case, in which
Justice Frankfurter broadly rationalized all the cases and derived
the rule that “a State, in enforcing some public policy, whether of
its criminal or its civil law, and whether announced by its legisla-

AFL v. Swing, 312 U.S. 321 (1941), the Court held unconstitutional an injunction
against peaceful picketing based on a state’s common-law policy against picketing
in the absence of an immediate dispute between employer and employee.
