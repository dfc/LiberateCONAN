the distinction itself. Upholding a prohibition on employment as teach-
ers of persons who advocated the desirability of overthrowing the
government, the Court declared that “[i]t is clear that such persons
have the right under our law to assemble, speak, think and believe
as they will. . . . It is equally clear that they have no right to work
for the state in the school system on their own terms. They may
work for the school system under reasonable terms laid down by
the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work
on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and asso-
ciations and go elsewhere. Has the State thus deprived them of any
right to free speech or assembly? We think not.” 767
     The same year, however, the Court expressly rejected the right-
privilege doctrine in another loyalty case. Voiding a loyalty oath re-
quirement conditioned on mere membership in suspect organiza-
tions, the Court reasoned that the interest of public employees in
being free of such an imposition was substantial. “There can be no
dispute about the consequences visited upon a person excluded from
public employment on disloyalty grounds. In the view of the com-
munity, the stain is a deep one; indeed, it has become a badge of
infamy. . . . [W]e need not pause to consider whether an abstract
right to public employment exists. It is sufficient to say that consti-
tutional protection does extend to the public servant whose exclu-
sion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discrimina-
tory.” 768 The premise here—that there is a constitutional claim against
dismissal or rejection—has faded in subsequent cases; the ratio-
nale now is that, although government may deny employment, or
any benefit for that matter, for any number of reasons, it may not
deny employment or other benefits on a basis that infringes a per-
son’s constitutionally protected interests. “For if the government could
that “the plain hard fact is that so far as the Constitution is concerned there is no
prohibition against the dismissal of Government employees because of their politi-
cal beliefs, activities or affiliations. . . . The First Amendment guarantees free speech
and assembly, but it does not guarantee Government employ.” Id. at 59. Although
the Supreme Court issued no opinion in Bailey, several Justices touched on the is-
sues in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123 (1951). Jus-
tices Douglas and Jackson in separate opinions rejected the privilege doctrine as
applied by the lower court in Bailey. Id. at 180, 185. Justice Black had previously
rejected the doctrine in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 105 (1947)
(dissenting opinion).
     767 Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 458, 492–93 (1952). Justices Douglas

and Black dissented, again rejecting the privilege doctrine. Id. at 508. Justice Frank-
furter, who dissented on other grounds, had previously rejected the doctrine in an-
other case, Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716, 725 (1951) (concurring in
part and dissenting in part).
     768 Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 190–91, 192 (1952). Some earlier cases

had used a somewhat qualified statement of the privilege. United Public Workers v.
Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 100 (1947); Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716,
722 (1951).
