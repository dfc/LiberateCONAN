in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC,1114
found it unnecessary to determine whether strict scrutiny or some
lesser standard applies, because it deemed the restriction invalid
under any of the alternative tests. There was no opinion of the Court
on the other two holdings in the case,1115 and a plurality 1116 re-
jected assertions that public forum analysis,1117 or a rule giving cable
operators’ editorial rights “general primacy” over the rights of pro-
grammers and viewers,1118 should govern.
     Subsequently, in United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,
Inc.,1119 the Supreme Court made clear, as it had not in Denver Con-
sortium, that strict scrutiny applies to content-based speech restric-
tions on cable television. The Court struck down a federal statute
designed to “shield children from hearing or seeing images result-
ing from signal bleed,” which refers to blurred images or sounds
that come through to non-subscribers.1120 The statute required cable
operators, on channels primarily dedicated to sexually oriented pro-
gramming, either to scramble fully or otherwise fully block such chan-
nels, or to not provide such programming when a significant num-
ber of children are likely to be viewing it, which, under an FCC
regulation meant to transmit the programming only from 10 p.m.
to 6 a.m. The Court found that, even without “discount[ing] the pos-
sibility that a graphic image could have a negative impact on a young
child,” it could not conclude that Congress had used “the least re-
strictive means for addressing the problem.” 1121 Congress in fact
had enacted another provision that was less restrictive and that served
     1114 518 U.S. 727, 755 (1996) (invalidating § 10(b) of the Cable Television Con-

sumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992).
     1115 Upholding § 10(a) of the Act, which permits cable operators to prohibit inde-

cent material on leased access channels; and striking down § 10(c), which permits a
cable operator to prevent transmission of “sexually explicit” programming on public
access channels. In upholding § 10(a), Justice Breyer’s plurality opinion cited FCC
v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), and noted that cable television “is as
‘accessible to children’ as over-the-air broadcasting, if not more so.” 518 U.S. at 744.
     1116 This section of Justice Breyer’s opinion was joined by Justices Stevens, O’Connor,

and Souter. 518 U.S. at 749.
     1117 Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Ginsburg, advocated this approach, 518

U.S. at 791, and took the plurality to task for its “evasion of any clear legal stan-
dard.” 518 U.S. at 784.
     1118 Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, advo-

cated this approach.
     1119 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).
     1120 529 U.S. at 806.
     1121 529 U.S. at 826–27. The Court did not state that there is a compelling in-

terest in preventing the possibility of a graphic image’s having a negative impact on
a young child, and may have implied that there is no compelling interest in prevent-
ing the possibility of a graphic image’s having a negative impact on an older child.
It did state: “Even upon the assumption that the government has an interest in
substituting itself for informed and empowered parents, its interest is not suffi-
ciently compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech.” Id. at 825.
