ment.1516 More recently, reaffirming that government has “a substan-
tial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise,” the
Court applied time, place, and manner analysis to uphold New York
City’s sound amplification guidelines designed to prevent excessive
noise and assure sound quality at outdoor concerts in Central Park.1517
    Door-to-Door Solicitation and Charitable Solicita-
tion.—In one of the Jehovah’s Witness cases, the Court struck down
an ordinance forbidding solicitors or distributors of literature from
knocking on residential doors in a community, the aims of the ordi-
nance being to protect privacy, to protect the sleep of many who
worked night shifts, and to protect against burglars posing as can-
vassers. The five-to-four majority concluded that on balance “[t]he
dangers of distribution can so easily be controlled by traditional le-
gal methods, leaving to each householder the full right to decide
whether he will receive strangers as visitors, that stringent prohi-
bition can serve no purpose but that forbidden by the Constitution,
the naked restriction of the dissemination of ideas.” 1518
    Later, although striking down an ordinance because of vague-
ness, the Court observed that it “has consistently recognized a mu-
nicipality’s power to protect its citizens from crime and undue an-
noyance by regulating soliciting and canvassing. A narrowly drawn
ordinance, that does not vest in municipal officers the undefined power
to determine what messages residents will hear, may serve these
important interests without running afoul of the First Amend-
ment.” 1519 The Court indicated that its precedents supported mea-
sures that would require some form of notice to officials and the
obtaining of identification in order that persons could canvas house-
to-house for charitable or political purposes.
    However, an ordinance that limited solicitation of contributions
door-to-door by charitable organizations to those that use at least
75% of their receipts directly for charitable purposes, defined so as
to exclude the expenses of solicitation, salaries, overhead, and other
administrative expenses, was invalidated as overbroad.1520 A pri-
vacy rationale was rejected, as just as much intrusion was likely
by permitted as by non-permitted solicitors. A rationale of preven-

assault the citizenry, government may turn them down.” Id. at 116.
