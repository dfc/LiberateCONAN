    Broadcast Radio and Television.—Because there are a lim-
ited number of broadcast frequencies for radio and non-cable televi-
sion use, the Federal Government licenses access to these frequen-
cies, permitting some applicants to use them and denying the greater
number of applicants such permission. Even though this licensing
system is in form a variety of prior restraint, the Court has held
that it does not present a First Amendment issue because of the
unique characteristic of scarcity.1086 Thus, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission has broad authority to determine the right of ac-
cess to broadcasting,1087 although, of course, the regulation must
be exercised in a manner that is neutral with regard to the content
