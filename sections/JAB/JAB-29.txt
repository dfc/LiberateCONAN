ciple.125 The second subsidiary argument that the Court rejected was
that, because the Pennsylvania program reimbursed parents who
sent their children to nonsectarian schools as well as to sectarian
ones, the portion respecting the former parents was valid and “par-
ents of children who attended sectarian schools are entitled to the
same aid as a matter of equal protection.” 126 The Court found the
argument “thoroughly spurious,” adding, “The Equal Protection Clause
has never been regarded as a bludgeon with which to compel a State
to violate other provisions of the Constitution.” 127
    In 1983, the Court clarified the limits of the Nyquist holding.
In Mueller v. Allen,128 the Court upheld a Minnesota deduction from
state income tax available to parents of elementary and secondary
school children for expenses incurred in providing tuition, transpor-
tation, textbooks, and various other school supplies. Because the Min-
nesota deduction was available to parents of public and private school-
children alike, the Court termed it “vitally different from the scheme
struck down in Nyquist,” and more similar to the benefits upheld
in Everson and Allen as available to all schoolchildren.129 The Court
declined to look behind the “facial neutrality” of the law and con-
sider empirical evidence of its actual impact, citing a need for “cer-
tainty” and the lack of “principled standards” by which to evaluate
such evidence.130 Also important to the Court’s refusal to consider
     125 413 U.S. at 788–89. But cf. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984) (Free

Exercise Clause “affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all
religions”).
     126 Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. 825, 834 (1973).
     127 413 U.S. at 834. In any event, the Court sustained the district court’s re-

fusal to sever the program and save that portion as to children attending non-
sectarian schools on the basis that, because so large a portion of the children ben-
efited attended religious schools, it could not be assumed the legislature would have
itself enacted such a limited program.
     In Wheeler v. Barrera, 417 U.S. 402 (1974), the Court held that states receiving
federal educational funds were required by federal law to provide “comparable” but
not equal services to both public and private school students within the restraints
imposed by state constitutional restrictions on aid to religious schools. In the ab-
sence of specific plans, the Court declined to review First Amendment limitations
on such services.
     128 463 U.S. 388 (1983).
     129 463 U.S. at 398. Nyquist had reserved the question of “whether the signifi-

cantly religious character of the statute’s beneficiaries might differentiate the pres-
ent cases from a case involving some form of public assistance (e.g., scholarships)
made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-
nonpublic nature of the institution benefitted.” 413 U.S. at 783 n.38.
     130 463 U.S. at 401. Justice Marshall’s dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Bren-

nan, Blackmun, and Stevens, argued that the tuition component of the deduction,
unavailable to parents of most public schoolchildren, was by far the most signifi-
cant, and that the deduction as a whole “was little more that a subsidy of tuition
masquerading as a subsidy of general educational expenses.” 463 U.S. at 408–09.
Cf. Grand Rapids School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985), where the Court empha-
sized that 40 of 41 nonpublic schools at which publicly funded programs operated
