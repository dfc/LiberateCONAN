rity benefits, Justice Harlan for the Court concluded that a ratio-
nal justification for the law might be the deportee’s inability to aid
the domestic economy by spending the benefits locally, although a
passage in the opinion could be read to suggest that termination
was permissible because alien Communists are undeserving of ben-
efits.697 Of considerable significance in First Amendment jurispru-
dence is Speiser v. Randall,698 in which the Court struck down a
state scheme for denying veterans’ property tax exemptions to “dis-
loyal” persons. The system, as interpreted by the state courts, de-
nied the exemption only to persons who engaged in speech that could
be criminally punished consistently with the First Amendment, but
the Court found the vice of the provision to be that, after each claim-
ant had executed an oath disclaiming his engagement in unlawful
speech, the tax assessor could disbelieve the oath taker and deny
the exemption, thereby placing on the claimant the burden of prov-
ing that he was loyal. “The vice of the present procedure is that,
where particular speech falls close to the line separating the lawful
and the unlawful, the possibility of mistaken fact-finding—
inherent in all litigation—will create the danger that the legiti-
mate utterance will be penalized. The man who knows that he must
bring forth proof and persuade another of the lawfulness of his con-
duct necessarily must steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if
the State must bear these burdens . . . . In practical operation, there-
fore, this procedural device must necessarily produce a result which
the State could not command directly. It can only result in a deter-
rence of speech which the Constitution makes free.” 699
    Employment Restrictions and Loyalty Oaths.—An area in
which significant First Amendment issues are often raised is the
establishment of loyalty-security standards for government employ-
ees. Such programs generally take one of two forms or may com-
bine the two. First, government may establish a system investigat-
ing employees or prospective employees under standards relating
to presumed loyalty. Second, government may require its employ-

Congress to have concluded that the public purse should not be utilized to contrib-

privilege distinction is all but moribund, Flemming was strongly reaffirmed in later
cases by emphasis on the noncontractual nature of such benefits. Richardson v. Belcher,
