government regulation of nonspeech activities.” 532 Intermediate scru-
tiny requires that the governmental interest be “significant” or “sub-
stantial” or “important” (but not necessarily “compelling”), and it
requires that the restriction be narrowly tailored (but not necessar-
ily the least restrictive means to advance the governmental inter-
est). Speech restrictions to which the Court does not apply strict
scrutiny include those that are not content-based (time, place, or
manner restrictions; incidental restrictions) and those that restrict
categories of speech to which the Court accords less than full First
Amendment protection (campaign contributions; commercial speech).533
Note that restrictions on expression may be content-based, but will
not receive strict scrutiny if they “are justified without reference to
the content of the regulated speech.” 534 Examples are bans on nude
dancing, and zoning restrictions on pornographic theaters or book-
stores, both of which, although content-based, receive intermediate
scrutiny on the ground that they are “aimed at combating crime
and other negative secondary effects,” and not at the content of
speech.535
    The Court uses tests closely related to one another in free speech
cases in which it applies intermediate scrutiny. It has indicated that
the test for determining the constitutionality of an incidental restric-

ses omitted). The Court, however, applied a rational basis standard to uphold a state
statute that banned the sale of sexually explicit material to minors. Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U.S. 629, 641 (1968). Of course, governmental restrictions on some speech,
such as obscenity and fighting words, receive no First Amendment scrutiny, except
that particular instances of such speech may not be discriminated against on the
basis of hostility “towards the underlying message expressed.” R.A.V. v. City of St.
Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 386 (1992).
     533 E.g., Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 481 (1988) (time, place, and manner

restriction upheld as “narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,
and leav[ing] open ample alternative channels of communication”); Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 798–799 (1989) (incidental restriction upheld as “promot[ing]
a substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively absent
the regulation”); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976) (campaign contribution ceil-
ing “may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest
and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational
freedom”); Board of Trustees v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989) (commercial speech
restrictions need not be “absolutely the least severe that will achieve the desired
end,” but must exhibit a “ ‘fit’ between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen
to accomplish those ends—a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable . . . ”
(internal quotation mark and citation omitted)). But see Thompson v. Western States
Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 371 (2002) (commercial speech restriction struck down
as “more extensive than necessary to serve” the government’s interests).

     535 Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 291 (2000) (upholding ban on nude danc-

ing); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 47 (1986) (upholding zoning of
“adult motion picture theaters”). Zoning and nude dancing cases are discussed be-
