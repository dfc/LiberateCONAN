solved whether the Press Clause confers upon the ‘institutional press’
any freedom from government restraint not enjoyed by all oth-
ers.” 395
    Several Court holdings do firmly point to the conclusion that
the press clause does not confer on the press the power to compel
government to furnish information or otherwise give the press ac-
cess to information that the public generally does not have.396 Nor,
in many respects, is the press entitled to treatment different in kind
from the treatment to which any other member of the public may
be subjected.397 “Generally applicable laws do not offend the First
Amendment simply because their enforcement against the press has
incidental effects.” 398 Yet, it does seem clear that, to some extent,
the press, because of its role in disseminating news and informa-
tion, is entitled to deference that others are not entitled to—that
its role constitutionally entitles it to governmental “sensitivity,” to
use Justice Stewart’s word.399 What difference such “sensitivity” might
make in deciding cases is difficult to say.
    The most interesting possibility lies in the First Amendment pro-
tection of good-faith defamation.400 Justice Stewart argued that the
Sullivan privilege is exclusively a free press right, denying that the
“constitutional theory of free speech gives an individual any immu-
nity from liability for libel or slander.” 401 To be sure, in all the cases
to date that the Supreme Court has resolved, the defendant has
     395 435 U.S. at 798. The Chief Justice’s conclusion was that the institutional

press had no special privilege as the press.
     396 Houchins v. KQED, 438 U.S. 1 (1978), and id. at 16 (Justice Stewart concur-

ring); Saxbe v. Washington Post, 417 U.S. 843 (1974); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S.
817 (1974); Nixon v. Warner Communications, 435 U.S. 589 (1978). The trial access
cases, whatever they may precisely turn out to mean, recognize a right of access of
both public and press to trials. Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980);
Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982).
     397 Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972) (grand jury testimony be newspa-

per reporter); Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547 (1978) (search of newspaper
offices); Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153 (1979) (defamation by press); Cohen v. Cowles
Media Co., 501 U.S. 663 (1991) (newspaper’s breach of promise of confidentiality).
     398 Cohen v. Cowles Media, 501 U.S. 663, 669 (1991).
     399 E.g., Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974); Landmark Com-

munications v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 (1978). See also Zurcher v. Stanford Daily,
436 U.S. 547, 563–67 (1978), and id. at 568 (Justice Powell concurring); Branzburg
v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 709 (1972) (Justice Powell concurring). Several concurring
opinions in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. (1980), imply recognition of
some right of the press to gather information that apparently may not be wholly
inhibited by nondiscriminatory constraints. Id. at 582–84 (Justice Stevens), 586 n.2
(Justice Brennan), 599 n.2 (Justice Stewart). Yet the Court has also suggested that
the press is protected in order to promote and to protect the exercise of free speech
in society at large, including peoples’ interest in receiving information. E.g., Mills v.
Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218–19 (1966); CBS v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 394–95 (1981).
     400 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). See discussion of “Defa-

mation,” infra.
