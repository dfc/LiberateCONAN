rule providing for the acceptance of delegates chosen only in an elec-

     Provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act requiring the
reporting and disclosure of contributions and expenditures to and
by political organizations, including the maintenance by such orga-
nizations of records of everyone contributing more than $10 and the
reporting by individuals and groups that are not candidates or po-
litical committees who contribute or expend more than $100 a year
for the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of an identified
candidate, were sustained.638 “[C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can
seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed
by the First Amendment. . . . We long have recognized the signifi-
cant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that com-
pelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of
some legitimate governmental interest. . . . We have required that
the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scru-
tiny. We have also insisted that there be a ‘relevant correlation’ or
‘substantial relation’ between the governmental interest and the in-
formation required to be disclosed.” 639 The governmental interests
effectuated by these requirements—providing the electorate with in-
formation, deterring corruption and the appearance of corruption,
and gathering data necessary to detect violations—were found to
be of sufficient magnitude to be validated even though they might
incidentally deter some persons from contributing.640 A claim that
contributions to minor parties and independents should have a blan-
ket exemption from disclosure was rejected inasmuch as an injury
was highly speculative; but any such party making a showing of a
reasonable probability that compelled disclosure of contributors’ names
would subject them to threats or reprisals could obtain an exemp-
tion from the courts.641 The Buckley Court also narrowly construed
the requirement of reporting independent contributions and expen-
ditures in order to avoid constitutional problems.642
     Conflict Between Organization and Members.—It is to be
expected that disputes will arise between an organization and some
of its members, and that First Amendment principles may be impli-
