residential area.1364 Similarly, an adult bookstore was subject to clo-
sure as a public nuisance where it was being used as a place for
prostitution and illegal sexual activities, because the closure “was
directed at unlawful conduct having nothing to do with books or
other expressive activity.” 1365 However, a city was held constitution-
ally powerless to prohibit drive-in motion picture theaters from show-
ing films containing nudity where the screen is visible from a pub-
lic street or place.1366 Also, the FCC was unable to justify a ban on
transmission of “indecent” but not obscene telephone messages.1367
     The Court has held, however, that “live” productions containing
nudity may be regulated to a greater extent than may films or pub-
lications. Whether this represents a distinction between live perfor-
mances and other entertainment media, or whether it signals a more
permissive approach overall to governmental regulation of non-
obscene but sexually explicit material, remains to be seen. In Barnes
v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,1368 the Court upheld application of Indiana’s
public indecency statute to require that dancers in public perfor-
mances of nude, non-obscene erotic dancing wear “pasties” and a
“G-string” rather than appear totally nude. There was no opinion
of the Court, three Justices viewing the statute as a permissible
regulation of “societal order and morality,” 1369 one viewing it as a
permissible means of regulating supposed secondary effects of pros-
titution and other criminal activity,1370 and a fifth Justice seeing
no need for special First Amendment protection from a law of gen-
     1364 Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976). Four of the five ma-

jority Justices thought the speech involved deserved less First Amendment protec-
tion than other expression, id. at 63–71, while Justice Powell, concurring, thought
the ordinance was sustainable as a measure that served valid governmental inter-
ests and only incidentally affected expression. Id. at 73. Justices Stewart, Brennan,
Marshall, and Blackmun dissented. Id. at 84, 88. Young was followed in City of Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, 475 U.S. 41 (1986), upholding a city ordinance prohibiting lo-
cation of adult theaters within 1,000 feet of residential areas, churches, or parks,
and within one mile of any school. Rejecting the claim that the ordinance regulated
content of speech, the Court indicated that such time, place and manner regulations
are valid if “designed to serve a substantial governmental interest” and if “allow-
[ing] for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.” Id. at 50. The city had
a substantial interest in regulating the “undesirable secondary effects” of such busi-
nesses. And, although the suitability for adult theaters of the remaining 520 acres
within the city was disputed, the Court held that the theaters “must fend for them-
selves in the real estate market,” and are entitled only to “a reasonable opportunity
to open and operate.” Id. at 54. The Supreme Court also upheld zoning of sexually
oriented businesses in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990), and City of Los
Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002).
     1365 Arcara v. Cloud Books, 478 U.S. 697, 707 (1986).
     1366 Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 204 (1975).
     1367 Sable Communications of California v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).
     1368 501 U.S. 560 (1991).
     1369 501 U.S. at 568 (Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices O’Connor and

Kennedy).
     1370 501 U.S. at 581 (Justice Souter).
