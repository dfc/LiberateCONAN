     The Roberts view was called into question in the 1960s, how-
ever, when the Court seemed to leave the issue open,1386 and when
a majority endorsed an opinion by Justice Black asserting his own
narrower view of speech rights in public places.1387 Later decisions
restated and quoted the Roberts language from Hague, and that is
now the position of the Court.1388 Public streets and parks,1389 in-
cluding those adjacent to courthouses 1390 and foreign embas-
sies,1391 as well as public libraries 1392 and the grounds of legisla-
tive bodies,1393 are open to public demonstrations, although the uses
to which public areas are dedicated may shape the range of permis-
sible expression and conduct that may occur there.1394 Moreover, not
all public properties are public forums. “[T]he First Amendment does

     1390 Narrowly drawn statutes that serve the state’s interests in security and in

preventing obstruction of justice and influencing of judicial officers are constitu-
tional. Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559 (1965). A restriction on carrying signs or plac-
ards on the grounds of the Supreme Court is unconstitutional as applied to the pub-
lic sidewalks surrounding the Court, since it does not sufficiently further the
governmental purposes of protecting the building and grounds, maintaining proper
order, or insulating the judicial decisionmaking process from lobbying. United States

     1391 In Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312 (1988), the Court struck down as content-

based a District of Columbia law prohibiting the display of any sign within 500 feet
of a foreign embassy if the sign tends to bring the foreign government into “public
odium” or “public disrepute.” However, another aspect of the District’s law, making
it unlawful for three or more persons to congregate within 500 feet of an embassy
and refuse to obey a police dispersal order, was upheld; under a narrowing construc-
tion, the law had been held applicable only to congregations directed at an embassy,
and reasonably believed to present a threat to the peace or security of the embassy.
