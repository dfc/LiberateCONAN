treated by the Justices.572 Thereafter, the Court dealt with the loyalty-
security program in several narrow decisions not confronting the
issue of denial or termination of employment because of beliefs or
“beliefs plus.” But the same issue was also before the Court in re-
lated fields. In American Communications Ass’n v. Douds,573 the Court
was again evenly divided over a requirement that, in order for a
union to have access to the NLRB, each of its officers must file an
affidavit that he neither believed in, nor belonged to an organiza-
tion that believed in, the overthrow of government by force or by
illegal means. Chief Justice Vinson thought the requirement reason-
able because it did not prevent anyone from believing what he chose
but only prevented certain people from being officers of unions, and
because Congress could reasonably conclude that a person with such
beliefs was likely to engage in political strikes and other conduct
that Congress could prevent.574 Dissenting, Justice Frankfurter thought
the provision too vague,575 Justice Jackson thought that Congress
could impose no disqualification upon anyone for an opinion or be-
lief that had not manifested itself in any overt act,576 and Justice
Black thought that government had no power to penalize beliefs in
any way.577 Finally, in Konigsberg v. State Bar of California,578 a
majority of the Court supported dictum in Justice Harlan’s opinion
in which he justified some inquiry into beliefs, saying that “[i]t would
indeed be difficult to argue that a belief, firm enough to be carried
over into advocacy, in the use of illegal means to change the form
of the State or Federal Government is an unimportant consider-
ation in determining the fitness of applicants for membership in a
profession in whose hands so largely lies the safekeeping of this
country’s legal and political institutions.”
     When the same issue returned to the Court years later, three
five-to-four decisions left the principles involved unclear.579 Four Jus-

    572 Bailey v. Richardson, 341 U.S. 918 (1951). See also Washington v. McGrath,

341 U.S. 923 (1951), aff ’g by an equally divided Court, 182 F.2d 375 (D.C. Cir. 1950).
Although no opinions were written in these cases, several Justices expressed them-
selves on the issues in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123
(1951), decided the same day.
    573 339 U.S. 382 (1950). In a later case raising the same point, the Court was

again equally divided. Osman v. Douds, 339 U.S. 846 (1950).
    574 339 U.S. at 408–09, 412.
    575 339 U.S. at 415.
    576 339 U.S. at 422.
    577 339 U.S. at 445.
    578 336 U.S. 36, 51–52 (1961). See also In re Anastaplo, 336 U.S. 82, 89 (1961).

Justice Black, joined by Justice Douglas and Chief Justice Warren, dissented on the
ground that the refusal to admit the two to the state bars was impermissibly based
upon their beliefs. Id. at 56, 97.
    579 Baird v. State Bar of Arizona, 401 U.S. 1 (1971); In re Stolar, 401 U.S. 23

(1971); Law Students Civil Rights Research Council v. Wadmond, 401 U.S. 154 (1971).
