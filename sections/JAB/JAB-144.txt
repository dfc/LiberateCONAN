sion 741 was on facially legitimate and neutral grounds; the Court’s
emphasis, however, upon the “plenary” power of Congress over ad-
mission or exclusion of aliens seemed to indicate where such a bal-
ance might be drawn.742

Material Support of Terrorist Organizations
    Congress may bar supporting the legitimate activities of cer-
tain foreign terrorist organizations through speech made to, under
the direction of, or in coordination with those groups. So held the
Court in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,743 a case challeng-
ing an effective prohibition on giving training in peaceful dispute
resolution, teaching how to petition the United Nations for relief,
providing legal expertise in negotiating peace agreements, and the
like.744 Without express reliance on wartime precedents, and yet also
without extended discussion of plaintiffs’ free speech interests, the
Court emphasized findings by the political branches that support
meant to promote peaceful conduct can nevertheless further terror-
ism by designated groups in multiple ways. The Court also cited
the narrowness of the proscription imposed. Only carefully defined
activities done in concert with previously designated organizations
were barred. Independent advocacy and mere membership were not
restricted. Given the national security and foreign affairs concerns
at stake, Congress had adequately balanced the competing inter-
ests of individual speech and government regulation, deference to
the informed judgment of the political branches being due even ab-
sent an extensive record of concrete evidence.745

     741 By §§ 212(a)(28)(D) and (G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,

8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(28)(D) and (G), aliens who advocate or write and publish “the
economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism” are made
ineligible to receive visas and are thus excluded from the United States. Upon the
recommendation of the Secretary of State, however, the Attorney General is autho-
rized to waive these provisions and to admit such an alien temporarily into the coun-
try. INA § 212(d)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3)(A).

     744 The six-Justice majority also held that the statute at issue gave adequate

notice of what conduct was prohibited, a conclusion with which the dissenting Jus-
tices agreed, and basic First Amendment rights of association and assembly were
not implicated, a conclusion about which the dissent was less sanguine. 561 U.S.
___, No. 08–1498, slip op. at 13–20, 34–35 (2010). See also 561 U.S. ___, No. 08–
1498, slip op. 1, 3–5 (2010) (Breyer, J., dissenting).
     745 The majority purported to apply a level of scrutiny more rigorous than the

intermediate scrutiny test applied in cases in which conduct, rather than the con-
tent of speech, is the primary target of regulation. 561 U.S. ___, No. 08–1498, slip
op. at 22–23 (2010). The dissent found the majority’s analysis to be too deferential
and insufficiently exacting, and also thought the case might be susceptible to resolu-
tion on statutory grounds if remanded. 561 U.S. ___, No. 08–1498, slip op. 7–22 (2010)
(Breyer, J., dissenting).
