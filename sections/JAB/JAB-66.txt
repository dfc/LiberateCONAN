the government.’ ” 320 Similarly, even a sincerely held religious be-
lief that assignment of a social security number would rob a child
of her soul was held insufficient to bar the government from using
the number for purposes of its own recordkeeping.321 It mattered
not how easily the government could accommodate the religious be-
liefs or practices (an exemption from the social security number re-
quirement might have been granted with only slight impact on the
government’s recordkeeping capabilities), since the nature of the gov-
ernmental actions did not implicate free exercise protections.322
    Compelling interest analysis is also wholly inapplicable in the
context of military rules and regulations, where First Amendment
review “is far more deferential than . . . review of similar laws or
regulations designed for civilian society.” 323 Thus the Court did not
question the decision of military authorities to apply uniform dress
code standards to prohibit the wearing of a yarmulke by an officer
compelled by his Orthodox Jewish religious beliefs to wear the yar-
mulke.324
    A high degree of deference is also due decisions of prison admin-
istrators having the effect of restricting religious exercise by in-
mates. The general rule is that prison regulations impinging on ex-
ercise of constitutional rights by inmates are “ ‘valid if . . . reasonably
related to legitimate penological interests.’ ” 325 Thus because gen-
eral prison rules requiring a particular category of inmates to work
outside of buildings where religious services were held, and prohib-
iting return to the buildings during the work day, could be viewed
as reasonably related to legitimate penological concerns of security
and order, no exemption was required to permit Muslim inmates to
participate in Jumu’ah, the core ceremony of their religion.326 The
fact that the inmates were left with no alternative means of attend-
ing Jumu’ah was not dispositive, the Court being “unwilling to hold

to wear religious apparel while in uniform, subject to exceptions to be made by the
Secretary of the relevant military department for circumstances in which the ap-
parel would interfere with performance of military duties or would not be “neat and
conservative.” Pub. L. 100–180, § 508(a)(2), 101 Stat. 1086 (1987); 10 U.S.C. § 774.
