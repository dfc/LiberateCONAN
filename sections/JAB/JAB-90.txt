imminent and likely the danger is.444 That standard has fluctuated
over the years, as the cases discussed below demonstrate.
    Clear and Present Danger.—Certain expression, oral or writ-
ten, may incite, urge, counsel, advocate, or importune the commis-
sion of criminal conduct; other expression, such as picketing, dem-
onstrating, and engaging in certain forms of “symbolic” action, may
either counsel the commission of criminal conduct or itself consti-
tute criminal conduct. Leaving aside for the moment the problem
of “speech-plus” communication, it becomes necessary to determine
when expression that may be a nexus to criminal conduct is sub-
ject to punishment and restraint. At first, the Court seemed dis-
posed in the few cases reaching it to rule that if the conduct could
be made criminal, the advocacy of or promotion of the conduct could
be made criminal.445 Then, in Schenck v. United States,446 in which
the defendants had been convicted of seeking to disrupt recruit-
ment of military personnel by disseminating leaflets, Justice Holmes
formulated the “clear and present danger” test that has ever since
been the starting point of argument. “The question in every case is
whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of
such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they
will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to
prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.” 447 The convic-
tions were unanimously affirmed. One week later, the Court again
unanimously affirmed convictions under the same act with Justice
Holmes writing, “we think it necessary to add to what has been
said in Schenck v. United States only that the First Amendment
while prohibiting legislation against free speech as such cannot have
been, and obviously was not, intended to give immunity for every
possible use of language. We venture to believe that neither Hamil-
ton nor Madison, nor any other competent person then or later, ever
supposed that to make criminal the counselling of a murder within
the jurisdiction of Congress would be an unconstitutional interfer-
ence with free speech.” 448 And, in Debs v. United States,449 Justice
Holmes upheld a conviction because “the natural and intended ef-
fect” and the “reasonably probable effect” of the speech for which
the defendant was prosecuted was to obstruct military recruiting.
    In Abrams v. United States,450 however, Justices Holmes and
Brandeis dissented upon affirmance of the convictions of several alien

   446 249 U.S. 47 (1919).
   447 249 U.S. at 52.
