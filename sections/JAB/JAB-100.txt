character,” Konigsberg testified that he did not believe in the vio-
lent overthrow of the government and that he had never know-
ingly been a member of any organization that advocated such ac-
tion, but he declined to answer any question pertaining to membership
in the Communist Party.
     For the Court, Justice Harlan began by asserting that freedom
of speech and association were not absolutes but were subject to
various limitations. Among the limitations, “general regulatory stat-
utes, not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally
limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type
of law the First or Fourteenth Amendment forbade Congress or the
States to pass, when they have been found justified by subordinat-
ing valid governmental interests, a prerequisite to constitutionality
which has necessarily involved a weighing of the governmental in-
terest involved.” 500 The governmental interest involved was the as-
surance that those admitted to the practice of law were committed
to lawful change in society and it was proper for the state to be-
lieve that one possessed of “a belief, firm enough to be carried over
into advocacy, in the use of illegal means to change the form” of
government did not meet the standard of fitness.501 On the other
hand, the First Amendment interest was limited because there was
“minimal effect upon free association occasioned by compulsory dis-
closure” under the circumstances. “There is here no likelihood that
deterrence of association may result from foreseeable private ac-
tion . . . for bar committee interrogations such as this are con-
ducted in private. . . . Nor is there the possibility that the State
may be afforded the opportunity for imposing undetectable arbi-
trary consequences upon protected association . . . for a bar appli-
cant’s exclusion by reason of Communist Party membership is sub-
ject to judicial review, including ultimate review by this Court, should
it appear that such exclusion has rested on substantive or proce-
dural factors that do not comport with the Federal Constitu-
tion.” 502

ries into the associations and activities of individuals in connection
with allegations of subversion 503 and to sustain proceedings against

     502 366 U.S. at 52–53. See also In re Anastaplo, 366 U.S. 82 (1961). The status

of these two cases is in doubt after Baird v. State Bar, 401 U.S. 1 (1971), and In re
Stolar, 401 U.S. 23 (1971), in which neither the plurality nor the concurring Justice
making up the majority used a balancing test.
