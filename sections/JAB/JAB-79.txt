ror, is necessary for the eventual ascertainment of the truth through
the conflict of ideas in the marketplace—a view skeptical of our abil-
ity ever to know the truth.391 A broader-grounded view is ex-
pounded by scholars who argue that freedom of expression is neces-
sary to promote individual self-fulfillment—that, when speech is freely
chosen by the speaker to persuade others, it defines and expresses
the speaker ’s “self ” and promotes his liberty 392 and “self-
realization” by enabling him to develop his powers and abilities and
to make and influence decisions regarding his destiny.393 The litera-
ture is enormous and no doubt the Justices as well as the larger
society are influenced by it, and yet the decisions, probably in large
part because they are the collective determination of nine individu-
als, seldom clearly reflect a principled and consistent acceptance of
any philosophy.

Freedom of Expression: Is There a Difference Between
  Speech and Press?
    Use of the single word “expression” to reach speech, press, peti-
tion, association, and the like, raises the question of whether the
free speech clause and the free press clause are coextensive, or whether
one reaches where the other does not. It has been much debated,
for example, whether the “institutional press” is entitled to greater
freedom from governmental regulations or restrictions than are non-
press individuals, groups, or associations. Justice Stewart has ar-
gued: “That the First Amendment speaks separately of freedom of
speech and freedom of the press is no constitutional accident, but
an acknowledgment of the critical role played by the press in Ameri-
can society. The Constitution requires sensitivity to that role, and
to the special needs of the press in performing it effectively.” 394 But,
as Chief Justice Burger wrote: “The Court has not yet squarely re-

ion in Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919). See Scanlon, Freedom of
Expression and Categories of Expression, 40 U. PITT. L. REV. 519 (1979). The theory
has been the dominant one in scholarly and judicial writings. Baker, Scope of the
