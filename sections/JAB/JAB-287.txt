tion of fraud was unavailing, as it could not be said that all asso-
ciations that spent more than 25% of their receipts on overhead were
actually engaged in a profit-making enterprise, and, in any event,
more narrowly drawn regulations, such as disclosure requirements,
could serve this governmental interest.
     Schaumburg was extended in Secretary of State v. Joseph H.
Munson Co.,1521 and Riley v. National Federation of the Blind.1522
In Munson, the Court invalidated a Maryland statute limiting pro-
fessional fundraisers to 25% of the amount collected plus certain
costs, and allowing waiver of this limitation if it would effectively
prevent the charity from raising contributions. In Riley, the Court
invalidated a North Carolina fee structure containing even more flex-
ibility.1523 The Court saw “no nexus between the percentage of funds
retained by the fundraiser and the likelihood that the solicitation
is fraudulent,” and was similarly hostile to any scheme that shifts
the burden to the fundraiser to show that a fee structure is reason-
able.1524 Moreover, a requirement that fundraisers disclose to poten-
tial donors the percentage of donated funds previously used for char-
ity was also invalidated in Riley, the Court indicating that the “more
benign and narrowly tailored” alternative of disclosure to the state
(accompanied by state publishing of disclosed percentages) could make
the information publicly available without so threatening the effec-
tiveness of solicitation.1525
     In Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y v. Village of Stratton, the Court
struck down an ordinance that made it a misdemeanor to engage
in door-to-door advocacy—religious, political, or commercial—
without first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit.1526
“It is offensive to the very notion of a free society,” the Court wrote,
from public solicitation violates the Establishment Clause). Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S.
414 (1988) (criminal penalty on use of paid circulators to obtain signatures for bal-
lot initiative suppresses political speech in violation of First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments).
     1521 467 U.S. 947 (1984).
     1522 487 U.S. 781 (1988).
     1523 A fee of up to 20% of collected receipts was deemed reasonable, a fee of

between 20 and 35% was permissible if the solicitation involved advocacy or the dis-
semination of information, and a fee in excess of 35% was presumptively unreason-
able, but could be upheld upon one of two showings: that advocacy or dissemination
of information was involved, or that otherwise the charity’s ability to collect money
or communicate would be significantly diminished.
     1524 487 U.S. at 793.
     1525 487 U.S. at 800. North Carolina’s requirement for licensing of professional

fundraisers was also invalidated in Riley, id. at 801–02. In Illinois ex rel. Madigan
v. Telemarketing Assocs., 538 U.S. 600 (2003), the Court held unanimously that the
First Amendment does not prevent a state from bringing fraud actions against chari-
table solicitors who falsely represent that a “significant” amount of each dollar do-
nated would be used for charitable purposes.
     1526 536 U.S. 150 (2002).
