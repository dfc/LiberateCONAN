holding a congressional prohibition on draft-card burnings, it has
stated the generally applicable rule. “[A] government regulation is
sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of Gov-
ernment; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental
interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppres-
sion of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged
First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to the fur-
therance of that government interest.” 1536 The Court has sug-
gested that this standard is virtually identical to that applied to
time, place, or manner restrictions on expression.1537
     Although almost unanimous in formulating and applying the test
in O’Brien, the Court splintered when it had to deal with one of
the more popular forms of “symbolic” conduct of the late 1960s and
early 1970s—flag burning and other forms of flag desecration. No
unifying theory capable of application to a wide range of possible
flag abuse actions emerged from the early cases. Thus, in Street v.
New York,1538 the defendant had been convicted under a statute pun-
ishing desecration “by words or act” upon evidence that when he
burned the flag he had uttered contemptuous words. The convic-
tion was set aside because it might have been premised on his words
alone or on his words and the act together, and no valid governmen-
tal interest supported penalizing verbal contempt for the flag.1539
    A few years later the Court reversed two other flag desecration
convictions, one on due process/vagueness grounds, the other un-
der the First Amendment. These cases were decided by the Court
in a manner that indicated an effort to begin to resolve the stan-
dards of First Amendment protection of “symbolic conduct.” In Smith
v. Goguen,1540 a statute punishing anyone who “publicly . . . treats
contemptuously the flag of the United States” was held unconstitu-
tionally vague, and a conviction for wearing trousers with a small
United States flag sewn to the seat was overturned. The language
subjected the defendant to criminal liability under a standard “so

did not preclude a flat proscription of flag burning or flag desecration for expressive
purposes. Id. at 594 (Chief Justice Warren), 609 (Justice Black), 610 (Justice White),

114, 257 N.E.2d 30 (1970), an equally divided Court, Justice Douglas not participat-
ing, sustained a flag desecration conviction of one who displayed sculptures in a gal-
lery, using the flag in apparently sexually bizarre ways to register a social protest.
