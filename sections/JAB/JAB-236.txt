son v. New Yorker Magazine 1242 refused to draw a distinction on
that narrow basis. Instead, “a deliberate alteration of words [in a
quotation] does not equate with knowledge of falsity for purposes
of [New York Times] unless the alteration results in a material change
in the meaning conveyed by the statement.” 1243
     False Statements.—As defamatory false statements can lead
to legal liability, so can false statements in other contexts run afoul
of legal prohibitions. For instance, more than 100 federal criminal
statutes punish false statements in areas of concern to federal courts
or agencies,1244 and the Court has often noted the limited First Amend-
ment value of such speech.1245 The Court, however, has declined to
find that all false statements fall outside of First Amendment pro-
tection. In United States v. Alvarez,1246 the Court overturned the
Stolen Valor Act of 2005,1247 which imposed criminal penalties for
falsely representing oneself to have been awarded a military deco-
ration or medal. In an opinion by Justice Kennedy, four Justices
distinguished false statement statutes that threaten the integrity
of governmental processes or that further criminal activity, and evalu-
ated the Act under a strict scrutiny standard.1248
    Noting that the Stolen Valor Act applied to false statements made
“at any time, in any place, to any person,” 1249 Justice Kennedy sug-
gested that upholding this law would leave the government with
the power to punish any false discourse without a clear limiting
principle. Justice Breyer, in a separate opinion joined by Justice Kagan,
concurred in judgment, but did so only after evaluating the prohibi-
tion under an intermediate scrutiny standard. While Justice Breyer
was also concerned about the breadth of the act, his opinion went
on to suggest that a similar statute, more finely tailored to situa-
tions where a specific harm is likely to occur, could withstand legal
challenge.1250
