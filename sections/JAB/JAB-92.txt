used, although the “bad tendency” test has usually been associated
with the case. In Whitney v. California,455 the Court affirmed a con-
viction under a criminal syndicalism statute based on the defen-
dant’s association with and membership in an organization that ad-
vocated the commission of illegal acts, finding again that the
determination of a legislature that such advocacy involves “danger
to the public peace and the security of the State” was entitled to
almost conclusive weight. In a technical concurrence, which was in
fact a dissent from the opinion of the Court, Justice Brandeis re-
stated the “clear and present danger” test. “[E]ven advocacy of vio-
lation [of the law] . . . is not a justification for denying free speech
where the advocacy fails short of incitement and there is nothing
to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on. . . .
In order to support a finding of clear and present danger it must
be shown either that immediate serious violence was to be ex-
pected or was advocated, or that the past conduct furnished reason
to believe that such advocacy was then contemplated.” 456
    The Adoption of Clear and Present Danger.—The Court did
not invariably affirm convictions during this period in cases like those
under consideration. In Fiske v. Kansas,457 it held that a criminal
syndicalism law had been invalidly applied to convict one against
whom the only evidence was the “class struggle” language of the
constitution of the organization to which he belonged. A conviction
for violating a “red flag” law was voided because the statute was
found unconstitutionally vague.458 Neither case mentioned clear and
present danger. An “incitement” test seemed to underlie the opin-
ion in DeJonge v. Oregon,459 upsetting a conviction under a crimi-
nal syndicalism statute for attending a meeting held under the aus-
pices of an organization that was said to advocate violence as a political
method, although the meeting was orderly and no violence was ad-
vocated during it. In Herndon v. Lowry,460 the Court narrowly re-
jected the contention that the standard of guilt could be made the
“dangerous tendency” of one’s words, and indicated that the power

of an opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker’s enthusiasm
for the result. Eloquence may set fire to reason. But whatever may be thought of
the redundant discourse before us it had no chance of starting a present conflagra-
tion. If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined
to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free
speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.” Id. at 673.
