    Threats of Violence Against Individuals.—The Supreme Court
has cited three “reasons why threats of violence are outside the First
Amendment”: “protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from
the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that
the threatened violence will occur.” 1165 In Watts v. United States,
however, the Court held that only “true” threats are outside the First
Amendment.1166 The defendant in Watts, at a public rally at which
he was expressing his opposition to the military draft, said, “If they
ever make me carry a rifle, the first man I want to get in my sights
is L.B.J.” 1167 He was convicted of violating a federal statute that
prohibited “any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm
upon the President of the United States.” The Supreme Court re-
versed. Interpreting the statute “with the commands of the First
Amendment clearly in mind,” 1168 it found that the defendant had
not made a “true ‘threat,’ ” but had indulged in mere “political hy-
perbole.” 1169
    In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., white merchants in
Claiborne County, Mississippi, sued the NAACP to recover losses
caused by a boycott by black citizens of their businesses, and to
enjoin future boycott activity.1170 During the course of the boycott,
NAACP Field Secretary Charles Evers had told an audience of “black
people that any ‘uncle toms’ who broke the boycott would ‘have their
necks broken’ by their own people.” 1171 The Court acknowledged that
this language “might have been understood as inviting an unlaw-
ful form of discipline or, at least, as intending to create a fear of
violence . . . .” 1172 Yet, no violence had followed directly from Evers’

citing Watts, upheld a statute that outlawed cross burnings done with the intent to
intimidate. A cross burning done as “a statement of ideology, a symbol of group soli-
darity,” or “in movies such as Mississippi Burning,” however, would be protected speech.
