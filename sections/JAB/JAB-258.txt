images that constitute obscenity or child pornography, and to pre-
vent minors from obtaining access to material that is harmful to
them.” 1358 The plurality asked “whether libraries would violate the
First Amendment by employing the filtering software that CIPA re-
quires.” 1359 Does CIPA, in other words, effectively violate library pa-
trons’ rights? The plurality concluded that it does not, after finding
that “Internet access in public libraries is neither a ‘traditional’ nor
a ‘designated’ public forum,” and that it therefore would not be ap-
propriate to apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the filter-
ing requirements are constitutional.1360
     The plurality acknowledged “the tendency of filtering software
to ‘overblock’—that is, to erroneously block access to constitution-
ally protected speech that falls outside the categories that software
users intend to block.” 1361 It found, however, that, “[a]ssuming that
such erroneous blocking presents constitutional difficulties, any such
concerns are dispelled by the ease with which patrons may have
the filtering software disabled.” 1362
    The plurality also considered whether CIPA imposes an uncon-
stitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance—in other
words, does it violate public libraries’ rights by requiring them to
limit their freedom of speech if they accept federal funds? The plu-
rality found that, assuming that government entities have First
Amendment rights (it did not decide the question), “CIPA does not
‘penalize’ libraries that choose not to install such software, or deny
them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered Internet ac-
cess. Rather, CIPA simply reflects Congress’s decision not to subsi-
dize their doing so.” 1363
    The government may also take notice of objective conditions at-
tributable to the commercialization of sexually explicit but non-
obscene materials. Thus, the Court recognized a municipality’s au-
thority to zone land to prevent deterioration of urban areas, upholding
an ordinance providing that “adult theaters” showing motion pic-
tures that depicted “specified sexual activities” or “specified anatomi-
cal areas” could not be located within 100 feet of any two other es-
tablishments included within the ordinance or within 500 feet of a

ies do not have the capacity to unblock specific Web sites or to disable the filter . . .
that would be the subject for an as-applied challenge, not the facial challenge made
in this case.” 539 U.S. at 215. Justice Souter, dissenting, noted that “the statute
says only that a library ‘may’ unblock, not that it must.” 539 U.S. at 233.
