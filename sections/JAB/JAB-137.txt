ees or prospective employees to subscribe to a loyalty oath disclaim-
ing belief in or advocacy of, or membership in an organization that
stands for or advocates, unlawful or disloyal action. The Federal
Government’s security investigation program has been tested nu-
merous times and First Amendment issues raised, but the Su-
preme Court has never squarely confronted the substantive consti-
tutional issues, and it has not dealt with the loyalty oath features
of the federal program.700 The Court has, however, had a long run-
ning encounter with state loyalty oath programs.701
     First encountered 702 was a loyalty oath for candidates for pub-
lic office rather than one for public employees. Accepting the state
court construction that the law required each candidate to “make
oath that he is not a person who is engaged ‘in one way or another
in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence,’
and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged
in such an attempt,” the Court unanimously sustained the provi-
sion in a one-paragraph per curiam opinion.703 Less than two months
later, the Court upheld a requirement that employees take an oath
that they had not within a prescribed period advised, advocated, or
taught the overthrow of government by unlawful means, nor been
a member of an organization with similar objectives; every em-
ployee was also required to swear that he was not and had not been

     700 The federal program is primarily grounded in two Executive Orders by Presi-

dent Truman and President Eisenhower, E.O. 9835, 12 Fed. Reg. 1935 (1947), and
E.O. 10450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (1953), and a significant amendatory Order issued by
President Nixon, E.O. 11605, 36 Fed. Reg. 12831 (1971). Statutory bases include 5
U.S.C. §§ 7311, 7531–32. Cases involving the program were decided either on lack
of authority for the action being reviewed, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956);
and Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331 (1955), or on procedural due process grounds,
Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474 (1959); Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v.
McElroy, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). But cf. United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967);
Schneider v. Smith, 390 U.S. 17 (1968). A series of three-judge district court deci-
sions, however, invalidated federal loyalty oaths and inquiries. Soltar v. Postmaster
General, 277 F. Supp. 579 (N.D. Calif. 1967); Haskett v. Washington, 294 F. Supp.
912 (D.D.C. 1968); Stewart v. Washington, 301 F. Supp. 610 (D.D.C. 1969); National
Ass’n of Letter Carriers v. Blount, 305 F. Supp. 546 (D.D.C. 1969) (no-strike oath).
     701 So-called negative oaths or test oaths are dealt with in this section; for the

positive oaths, see “Imposition of Consequences for Holding Certain Beliefs,” supra.
     702 Test oaths had first reached the Court in the period following the Civil War,

at which time they were voided as ex post facto laws and bills of attainder. Cum-
mings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277 (1867); Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.)
333 (1867).
     703 Gerende v. Board of Supervisors of Elections, 341 U.S. 56 (1951) (emphasis

original). In Indiana Communist Party v. Whitcomb, 414 U.S. 411 (1974), a require-
ment that parties and candidates seeking ballot space subscribe to a similar oath
was voided because the oath’s language did not comport with the advocacy stan-
dards of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969). Four Justices concurred more
narrowly. 414 U.S. at 452 n.3. See also Whitcomb v. Communist Party of Indiana,
410 U.S. 976 (1973).
