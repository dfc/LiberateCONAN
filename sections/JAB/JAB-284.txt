matters of importance.” 1504 On the other hand, responding to the
city’s defense that the ordinance was aimed at providing a means
to identify those responsible for fraud, false advertising, and the
like, the Court noted that “the ordinance is in no manner so lim-
ited . . . .Therefore we do not pass on the validity of an ordinance
limited to these or any other supposed evils.” 1505
    Talley’s anonymity rationale was strengthened in McIntyre v. Ohio
Elections Comm’n,1506 invalidating Ohio’s prohibition on the distri-
bution of anonymous campaign literature. There is a “respected tra-
dition of anonymity in the advocacy of political causes,” the Court
noted, and neither of the interests asserted by Ohio justified the
limitation. The state’s interest in informing the electorate was “plainly
insufficient,” and, although the more weighty interest in prevent-
ing fraud in the electoral process may be accomplished by a direct
prohibition, it may not be accomplished indirectly by an indiscrimi-
nate ban on a whole category of speech. Ohio could not apply the
prohibition, therefore, to punish anonymous distribution of pam-
phlets opposing a referendum on school taxes.1507
     The handbilling cases were distinguished in City Council v. Tax-
payers for Vincent,1508 in which the Court held that a city may pro-
hibit altogether the use of utility poles for posting of signs. Al-
though a city’s concern over visual blight could be addressed by an
anti-littering ordinance not restricting the expressive activity of dis-
tributing handbills, in the case of utility pole signs “it is the me-
dium of expression itself ” that creates the visual blight. Hence, the
city’s prohibition, unlike a prohibition on distributing handbills, was
narrowly tailored to curtail no more speech than necessary to ac-

    1505  362 U.S. at 64. In Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241 (1967), the Court di-
rected a lower court to consider the constitutionality of a statute which made it a
criminal offense to publish or distribute election literature without identification of
the name and address of the printer and of the persons sponsoring the literature.
The lower court voided the law, but changed circumstances on a new appeal caused
the Court to dismiss. Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103 (1969).

     1507 In Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, 525 U.S. 182 (1999),

the Court struck down a Colorado statute requiring initiative-petition circulators to
wear identification badges. It found that “the restraint on speech in this case is more
severe than was the restraint in McIntyre” because “[p]etition circulation is a less
fleeting encounter, for the circulator must endeavor to persuade electors to sign the
petition. . . . [T]he badge requirement compels personal name identification at the
precise moment when the circulator’s interest in anonymity is greatest.” Id. at 199.
In Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150, 166 (2002),
concern for the right to anonymity was one reason that the Court struck down an
ordinance that made it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without
first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit.
