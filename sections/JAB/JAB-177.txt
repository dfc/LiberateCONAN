gressman or his state legislator, to cause others to write or other-
wise contact legislators, and to make speeches and publish articles
designed to influence legislators. Conflict is inherent. In the Fed-
eral Regulation of Lobbying Act,918 Congress, by broadly phrased
and ambiguous language, seemed to require detailed reporting and
registration by all persons who solicited, received, or expended funds
for purposes of lobbying; that is, to influence congressional action
directly or indirectly. In United States v. Harriss,919 the Court, stat-
ing that it was construing the Act to avoid constitutional doubts,920
interpreted covered lobbying as meaning only direct attempts to in-
fluence legislation through direct communication with members of
Congress.921 So construed, the Act was constitutional; Congress had
“merely provided for a modicum of information from those who for
hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds
for that purpose,” and this was simply a measure of “self-
protection.” 922
    Other statutes and governmental programs affect lobbying and
lobbying activities. It is not impermissible for the Federal Govern-
ment to deny a business expense tax deduction for money spent to
defeat legislation that would adversely affect one’s business.923 But
the antitrust laws may not be applied to a concert of business en-
terprises that have joined to lobby the legislative branch to pass
and the executive branch to enforce laws that would have a detri-
mental effect upon competitors, even if the lobbying was conducted
unethically.924 On the other hand, allegations that competitors com-
bined to harass and deter others from having free and unlimited
access to agencies and courts by resisting before those bodies all
petitions of competitors for purposes of injury to competition are
sufficient to implicate antitrust principles.925

     922 347 U.S. at 625. Justices Douglas, Black, and Jackson dissented. Id. at 628,

633. They thought the Court’s interpretation too narrow and would have struck the
statute down as being too broad and too vague, but would not have denied Congress
the power to enact narrow legislation to get at the substantial evils of the situation.

Justices Stewart and Brennan thought that joining to induce administrative and
judicial action was as protected as the concert in Noerr but concurred in the result
because the complaint could be read as alleging that defendants had sought to fore-
stall access to agencies and courts by plaintiffs. Id. at 516.
