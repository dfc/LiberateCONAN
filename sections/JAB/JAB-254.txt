violates the statute, even if the officer possesses no child pornogra-
phy. Likewise, a person who advertises virtual child pornography
as depicting actual children also falls within the reach of the stat-
ute.” 1342 The Court found that these activities are not constitution-
ally protected because “[o]ffers to engage in illegal transactions [as
opposed to abstract advocacy of illegality] are categorically ex-
cluded from First Amendment protection,” even “when the offeror
is mistaken about the factual predicate of his offer,” such as when
the child pornography that one offers to buy or sell does not exist
or is constitutionally protected.1343
     Non-obscene But Sexually Explicit and Indecent Expres-
sion.—There is expression, consisting of words or pictures, that some
find offensive but that does not constitute obscenity and is pro-
tected by the First Amendment. Nudity portrayed in films or stills
cannot be presumed obscene; 1344 nor can offensive language ordinar-
ily be punished simply because it offends someone.1345 Nonetheless,
government may regulate sexually explicit but non-obscene expres-

    1343  128 S. Ct. at 1841, 1842, 1843. Justice Souter, in a dissenting opinion joined
by Justice Ginsburg, agreed that “Congress may criminalize proposals unrelated to
any extant image,” but disagreed with respect to “proposals made with regard to
specific, existing [constitutionally protected] representations.” Id. at 1849. Justice Souter
believed that, “if the Act stands when applied to identifiable, extant [constitution-
ally protected] pornographic photographs, then in practical terms Ferber and Free
Speech Coalition fall. They are left as empty as if the Court overruled them for-
mally . . . .” Id. at 1854. Justice Scalia’s opinion for the majority replied that this
“is simply not true . . . . Simulated child pornography will be as available as ever,
so long as it is offered and sought as such, and not as real child pornography. . . .
There is no First Amendment exception from the general principle of criminal law
that a person attempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has
a mistaken view of the facts.” Id. at 1844–45.

     1345 E.g., Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). Special rules apply to broad-

cast speech, which, because of its pervasive presence in the home and its accessibil-
ity to children, is accorded “the most limited First Amendment protection” of all me-
dia; non-obscene but indecent language and nudity may be curtailed, with the time
of day and other circumstances determining the extent of curtailment. FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 748 (1978). However, efforts by Congress and the FCC to
extend the indecency ban to 24 hours a day were rebuffed by an appeals court. Ac-
tion for Children’s Television v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (invalidating
regulations promulgated pursuant to Pub. L. 100–459, § 608), cert. denied, 503 U.S.
913 (1992). Earlier, the same court had invalidated an FCC restriction on indecent,
non-obscene broadcasts from 6 a.m. to midnight, finding that the FCC had failed to
adduce sufficient evidence to support the restraint. Action for Children’s Television
v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332, 1335 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In 1992, however, Congress imposed a
6 a.m.-to-midnight ban on indecent programming, with a 10 p.m.-to-midnight excep-
tion for public radio and television stations that go off the air at or before midnight.
Pub. L. 102–356, § 16 (1992), 47 U.S.C. § 303 note. This time, after a three-judge
panel found the statute unconstitutional, the en banc court of appeals upheld it,
except for its 10 p.m.-to-midnight ban on indecent material on non-public stations.
