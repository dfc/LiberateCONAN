complish the city’s legitimate purpose.1509 Ten years later, however,
the Court unanimously invalidated a town’s broad ban on residen-
tial signs that permitted only residential identification signs, “for
sale” signs, and signs warning of safety hazards.1510 Prohibiting home-
owners from displaying political, religious, or personal messages on
their own property entirely foreclosed “a venerable means of com-
munication that is unique and important,” and that is “an unusu-
ally cheap form of communication” without viable alternatives for
many residents.1511 The ban was thus reminiscent of total bans on
leafleting, distribution of literature, and door-to-door solicitation that
the Court had struck down in the 1930s and 1940s. The prohibi-
tion in Vincent was distinguished as not removing a “uniquely valu-
able or important mode of communication,” and as not impairing
citizens’ ability to communicate.1512
     Sound Trucks, Noise.—Physical disruption may occur by other
means than the presence of large numbers of demonstrators. For
example, the use of sound trucks to convey a message on the streets
may disrupt the public peace and may disturb the privacy of per-
sons off the streets. The cases, however, afford little basis for a gen-
eral statement of constitutional principle. Saia v. New York,1513 while
it spoke of “loud-speakers as today indispensable instruments of ef-
fective public speech,” held only that a particular prior licensing sys-
tem was void. A five-to-four majority upheld a statute in Kovacs v.
Cooper,1514 which was ambiguous with regard to whether all sound
trucks were banned or only “loud and raucous” trucks and which
the state court had interpreted as having the latter meaning. In
another case, the Court upheld an antinoise ordinance which the
state courts had interpreted narrowly to bar only noise that actu-
ally or immediately threatened to disrupt normal school activity dur-
ing school hours.1515 But the Court was careful to tie its ruling to
the principle that the particular requirements of education necessi-
tated observance of rules designed to preserve the school environ-

     1509 Justice Brennan argued in dissent that adequate alternative forms of com-

munication were not readily available because handbilling or other person-to-person
methods would be substantially more expensive, and that the regulation for the sake
of aesthetics was not adequately justified.
