     Commentary about matters of “public interest” when it de-
fames someone is apparently, after Firestone 1223 and Gertz, to be
protected to the degree that the person defamed is a public official
or candidate for public office, public figure, or private figure. That
there is a controversy, that there are matters that may be of “pub-
lic interest,” is insufficient to make a private person a “public fig-
ure” for purposes of the standard of protection in defamation ac-
tions.
     The Court has elaborated on the principles governing defama-
tion actions brought by private figures. First, when a private plain-
tiff sues a media defendant for publication of information that is a
matter of public concern—the Gertz situation, in other words—the
burden is on the plaintiff to establish the falsity of the information.
Thus, the Court held in Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps,1224 the
common law rule that defamatory statements are presumptively false
must give way to the First Amendment interest that true speech
on matters of public concern not be inhibited. This means, as the
dissenters pointed out, that a Gertz plaintiff must establish falsity
in addition to establishing some degree of fault (e.g., negli-
gence).1225 On the other hand, the Court held in Dun & Bradstreet
v. Greenmoss Builders that the Gertz standard limiting award of
presumed and punitive damages applies only in cases involving mat-
ters of public concern, and that the sale of credit reporting informa-
tion to subscribers is not such a matter of public concern.1226 What
significance, if any, is to be attributed to the fact that a media de-
fendant rather than a private defendant has been sued is left un-
clear. The plurality in Dun & Bradstreet declined to follow the lower
court’s rationale that Gertz protections are unavailable to nonmedia

tices Rehnquist and O’Connor, and Chief Justice Burger and Justice White, both of
whom had dissented in Gertz, added brief concurring opinions agreeing that the Gertz
standard should not apply to credit reporting. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices
Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, dissented, arguing that Gertz had not been lim-
ited to matters of public concern, and should not be extended to do so.
