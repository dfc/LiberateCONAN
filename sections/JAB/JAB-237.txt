    Invasion of Privacy.—Governmental power to protect the pri-
vacy interests of its citizens by penalizing publication or authoriz-
ing causes of action for publication implicates directly First Amend-
ment rights. Privacy is a concept composed of several aspects.1251
As a tort concept, it embraces at least four branches of protected
interests: protection from unreasonable intrusion upon one’s seclu-
sion, from appropriation of one’s name or likeness, from unreason-
able publicity given to one’s private life, and from publicity which
unreasonably places one in a false light before the public.1252
     Although the Court has variously recognized valid governmen-
tal interests in extending protection to privacy,1253 it has neverthe-
less interposed substantial free expression interests in the balance.
Thus, in Time, Inc. v. Hill,1254 the Times privilege was held to pre-
clude recovery under a state privacy statute that permitted recov-
ery for harm caused by exposure to public attention in any publica-
tion which contained factual inaccuracies, although not necessarily
defamatory inaccuracies, in communications on matters of public in-
terest. Since Gertz held that the Times privilege did not limit the
recovery of compensatory damages for defamation by private per-
sons, the question arose whether Hill applies to all “false-light” cases
or only such cases involving public officials or public figures.1255 And,
more important, Gertz left unresolved the issue “whether the State
may ever define and protect an area of privacy free from unwanted
publicity in the press.” 1256
    In Cox Broadcasting, the Court declined to pass on the broad
question, holding instead that the accurate publication of informa-
tion obtained from public records is absolutely privileged. Thus, the
state could not permit a civil recovery for invasion of privacy occa-
sioned by the reporting of the name of a rape victim obtained from

that we do not have here the question of the protection of one’s privacy from govern-
mental invasion.

were originally propounded in Prosser’s 1960 article, incorporated in the Restate-
ment, and now “routinely accept[ed].” McCarthy, § 5.8[A].
