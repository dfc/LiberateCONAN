the guarantees of speech and press and may require the balancing
away of rights that might be preserved inviolate at other times. The
drawing of the line is committed, not exclusively but finally, to the
Supreme Court. In this section, we consider a number of areas in
which the necessity to draw lines has arisen.
    Punishment of Advocacy.—Criminal punishment for the ad-
vocacy of illegal or of merely unpopular goals and ideas did not origi-
nate in the United States with the post-World War II concern with
Communism. Enactment of and prosecutions under the Sedition Act
of 1798 667 and prosecutions under the federal espionage laws 668 and
state sedition and criminal syndicalism laws 669 in the 1920s and
early 1930s have been alluded to earlier.670 But it was in the 1950s
and the 1960s that the Supreme Court confronted First Amend-
ment concepts fully in determining the degree to which govern-
ment could proceed against persons and organizations that it be-
lieved were plotting and conspiring both to advocate the overthrow
of government and to accomplish that goal.
     The Smith Act of 1940 671 made it a criminal offense to know-
ingly or willfully to advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, neces-
sity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing the government of the
United States or of any state by force or violence, or to organize
any association that teaches, advises, or encourages such an over-
throw, or to become a member of or to affiliate with any such asso-

    667  Ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596 (1798).
    668  The cases included Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919) (affirming
conviction for attempting to disrupt conscription by circulation of leaflets bitterly
condemning the draft); Debs v. United States, 249 U.S. 211 (1919) (affirming convic-
tion for attempting to create insubordination in armed forces based on one speech
advocating socialism and opposition to war, and praising resistance to the draft);
Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919) (affirming convictions based on two
leaflets, one of which attacked President Wilson as a coward and hypocrite for send-
ing troops into Russia and the other of which urged workers not to produce materi-
als to be used against their brothers).
     669 The cases included Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925) (affirming con-

viction based on publication of “manifesto” calling for the furthering of the “class
struggle” through mass strikes and other mass action); Whitney v. California, 274
U.S. 357 (1927) (affirming conviction based upon adherence to party which had plat-
form rejecting parliamentary methods and urging a “revolutionary class struggle,”
the adoption of which defendant had opposed).
     670 See discussion under “Adoption and the Common Law Background,” and “Clear

and Present Danger,” supra. See also Taylor v. Mississippi, 319 U.S. 583 (1943), set-
ting aside convictions of three Jehovah’s Witnesses under a statute that prohibited
teaching or advocacy intended to encourage violence, sabotage, or disloyalty to the
government after the defendants had said that it was wrong for the President “to
send our boys across in uniform to fight our enemies” and that boys were being killed
“for no purpose at all.” The Court found no evil or sinister purpose, no advocacy of
or incitement to subversive action, and no threat of clear and present danger to gov-
ernment.
