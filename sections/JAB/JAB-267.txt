these demonstrators resulted in violence,1411 and may not vary a
demonstration licensing fee based on an estimate of the amount of
hostility likely to be engendered,1412 but the Court’s position with
regard to the “heckler’s veto,” the governmental termination of a
speech or demonstration because of hostile crowd reaction, remains
unclear.1413
    The Court has defined three categories of public property for
public forum analysis. First, there is the traditional public forum—
places such as streets and parks that have traditionally been used
for public assembly and debate, where the government may not pro-
hibit all communicative activity and must justify content-neutral time,
place, and manner restrictions as narrowly tailored to serve a legiti-
mate interest.1414 Second, there is the designated public forum, where
the government opens property for communicative activity and thereby
creates a public forum. Such a forum may be limited—hence the
expression “limited public forum”—for “use by certain groups, e.g.,
Widmar v. Vincent (student groups), or for discussion of certain sub-
jects, e.g., City of Madison Joint School District v. Wisconsin PERC

     1411 The only precedent is Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290 (1951). The holding

was on a much narrower basis, but in dictum the Court said: “The court below has
mistakenly derived support for its conclusions from the evidence produced at the
trial that appellant’s religious meetings had, in the past, caused some disorder. There
are appropriate public remedies to protect the peace and order of the community if
appellant’s speeches should result in disorder and violence.” Id. at 294. A different
rule applies to labor picketing. See Milk Wagon Drivers Local 753 v. Meadowmoor
Dairies, 312 U.S. 287 (1941) (background of violence supports prohibition of all peace-
ful picketing). The military may ban a civilian, previously convicted of destroying
government property, from reentering a military base, and may apply the ban to
prohibit the civilian from reentering the base for purposes of peaceful demonstra-
tion during an Armed Forces Day “open house.” United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S.
675 (1985).
     1412 Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123 (1992) (a fee based

on anticipated crowd response necessarily involves examination of the content of the
speech, and is invalid as a content regulation).
     1413 Dicta indicate that a hostile reaction will not justify suppression of speech,

Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 502 (1939); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 551 (1965);
Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564, 567 (1970), and one holding appears to point
this way. Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394 U.S. 111 (1969). Yet the Court upheld a
breach of the peace conviction of a speaker who refused to cease speaking upon the
demand of police who feared imminent violence. Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315
(1951). In Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 273 (1951) (concurring opinion), Jus-
tice Frankfurter wrote: “It is not a constitutional principle that, in acting to pre-
serve order, the police must proceed against the crowd whatever its size and temper
and not against the speaker.”
     1414 “[A]lthough a park is a traditional public forum for speeches and other tran-

sitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in a public park is not
a form of expression to which forum analysis applies. Instead, the placement of a
permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech
and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.” Pleasant
Grove City, Utah v. Summum, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 1129 (2009).
