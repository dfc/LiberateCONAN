limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into
one’s privacy.” 1321 Despite the unqualified assertion in Roth that ob-
scenity was not protected by the First Amendment, the Court ob-
served, it and the cases following were concerned with the govern-
mental interest in regulating commercial distribution of obscene
materials. Roth and the cases following that decision are not im-
paired by today’s decision, the Court insisted,1322 but in its rejec-
tion of each of the state contentions made in support of the convic-
tion the Court appeared to be rejecting much of the basis of Roth.
First, there is no governmental interest in protecting an individu-
al’s mind from the effect of obscenity. Second, the absence of ideo-
logical content in the films was irrelevant, since the Court will not
draw a line between transmission of ideas and entertainment. Third,
there is no empirical evidence to support a contention that expo-
sure to obscene materials may incite a person to antisocial con-
duct; even if there were such evidence, enforcement of laws proscrib-
ing the offensive conduct is the answer. Fourth, punishment of mere
possession is not necessary to punishment of distribution. Fifth, there
was little danger that private possession would give rise to the ob-
jections underlying a proscription upon public dissemination, expo-
sure to children and unwilling adults.1323
     Stanley’s broad rationale has been given a restrictive reading,
and the holding has been confined to its facts. Any possible implica-
tion that Stanley was applicable outside the home and recognized
a right to obtain pornography or a right in someone to supply it
was soon dispelled.1324 The Court has consistently rejected Stan-
ley’s theoretical underpinnings, upholding morality-based regula-
tion of the behavior of consenting adults.1325 Also, Stanley has been
held inapplicable to possession of child pornography in the home,
the Court determining that the state interest in protecting chil-
dren from sexual exploitation far exceeds the interest in Stanley of
protecting adults from themselves.1326 Apparently for this reason, a
state’s conclusion that punishment of mere possession is a neces-
