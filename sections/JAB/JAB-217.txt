content regulation within categories of protected expression neces-
sitates a brief treatment. It remains standard doctrine that it is
impermissible for the government to regulate protected expression
on the basis of its content.1129 Justice Stevens, however, has articu-
lated a theory that would permit some governmental restraint based
upon content. In Justice Stevens’ view, there is a hierarchy of speech,
and where the category of speech at issue fits into that hierarchy
determines the appropriate level of protection under the First Amend-
ment. A category’s place on the continuum is guided by Chaplinsky’s
formulation of whether it is “an essential part of any exposition of
ideas” and what its “social value as a step to truth” is.1130 Thus,
offensive but nonobscene words and portrayals dealing with sex and
excretion may be regulated when the expression plays no role or a
minimal role in the exposition of ideas.1131 “Whether political ora-
tory or philosophical discussion moves us to applaud or to despise
what is said, every schoolchild can understand why our duty to de-
fend the right to speak remains the same. But few of us would march
our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen’s right to
see ‘Specified Sexual Activities’ exhibited in the theaters of our
choice.” 1132
    Although a majority of the Court has not joined in Justice Ste-
vens’ theory,1133 the Court has in some contexts of covered expres-
sion approved restrictions based on content,1134 and, in still other
areas, such as privacy, has implied that it would approve some content-

     1133 In New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 763 (1982), a majority of the Court

joined an opinion quoting much of Justice Stevens’ language in these cases, but the
opinion rather clearly adopts the proposition that the disputed expression, child por-
nography, is not covered by the First Amendment, not that it is covered but subject
to suppression because of its content. Id. at 764. See also id. at 781 (Justice Stevens
concurring in judgment).
     1134 E.g., commercial speech, which is covered by the First Amendment but is

less protected than other speech, is subject to content-based regulation. Central Hud-
son Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 568–69 (1980). See also Rowan v. Post
Office Dep’t, 397 U.S. 728 (1970) (sexually oriented, not necessarily obscene mail-
ings); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991) (nonobscene nude danc-
ing).
