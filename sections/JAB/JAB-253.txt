tual minors.1333 Prohibited pictures included computer-generated (“vir-
tual”) child pornography, and photographs of adult actors who ap-
peared to be minors, as well as “a Renaissance painting depicting a
scene from classical mythology.” 1334 The Court observed that stat-
utes that prohibit child pornography that use real children are con-
stitutional because they target “[t]he production of the work, not
the content.” 1335 The CPPA, by contrast, targeted the content, not
the means of production. The government’s rationales for the CPPA
included that “[p]edophiles might use the materials to encourage
children to participate in sexual activity” and might “whet their own
sexual appetites” with it, “thereby increasing . . . the sexual abuse
and exploitation of actual children.” 1336 The Court found these ra-
tionales inadequate because the government “cannot constitution-
ally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person’s
private thoughts” and “may not prohibit speech because it in-
creases the chance an unlawful act will be committed ‘at some in-
definite future time.’ ” 1337 The government had also argued that the
existence of “virtual” child pornography “can make it harder to pros-
ecute pornographers who do use real minors,” because, “[a]s imag-
ing technology improves . . . , it becomes more difficult to prove that
a particular picture was produced using actual children.” 1338 This
rationale, the Court found, “turns the First Amendment upside down.
The Government may not suppress lawful speech as a means to sup-
press unlawful speech.” 1339
     In United States v. Williams,1340 the Supreme Court upheld a
federal statute that prohibits knowingly advertising, promoting, pre-
senting, distributing, or soliciting material “in a manner that re-
flects the belief, or that is intended to cause another to believe, that
the material” is child pornography that is obscene or that depicts
an actual minor (i.e., is child pornography that is not constitution-
ally protected).1341 Under the provision, in other words, “an Inter-
net user who solicits child pornography from an undercover agent

acted the PROTECT Act, Pub. L. 108–21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), which, despite the
decision in that case, defined “child pornography” so as to continue to prohibit computer-
generated child pornography (but not other types of child pornography produced with-
out an actual minor). 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(B). In United States v. Williams, 128 S.

nition, cited Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition with approval.
