seller “pandered” them in a way that indicated he was catering to
prurient interests. The same five-Justice majority, with Justice Har-
lan concurring, the same day affirmed a state conviction of a dis-
tributor of books addressed to a sado-masochistic audience, apply-
ing the “pandering” test and concluding that material could be held
legally obscene if it appealed to the prurient interests of the devi-
ate group to which it was directed.1295 Unanimity was shattered,
however, when on the same day the Court held that Fanny Hill, a
novel at that point 277 years old, was not legally obscene.1296 The
prevailing opinion again restated the Roth tests that, to be consid-
ered obscene, material must (1) have a dominant theme in the work
considered as a whole that appeals to prurient interest, (2) be pa-
tently offensive because it goes beyond contemporary community stan-
dards, and (3) be utterly without redeeming social value.1297
     After the divisions engendered by the disparate opinions in the
three 1966 cases, the Court over the next several years submerged
its differences by per curiam dispositions of nearly three dozen cases,
in all but one of which it reversed convictions or civil determina-
tions of obscenity. The initial case was Redrup v. New York,1298 in
which, after noting that the cases involved did not present special
questions requiring other treatment, such as concern for juveniles,
protection of unwilling adult recipients, or proscription of pander-
ing,1299 the Court succinctly summarized the varying positions of
the seven Justices in the majority and said: “[w]hichever of the con-
stitutional views is brought to bear upon the cases before us, it is
clear that the judgments cannot stand . . . .” 1300 And so things went
for several years.1301
    Changing membership on the Court raised increasing specula-
tion about the continuing vitality of Roth; it seemed unlikely the
Court would long continue its Redrup approach.1302 The change when
     1295 Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502 (1966). See id. at 507–10 for discussion

of the legal issue raised by the limited appeal of the material. The Court relied on
Mishkin in Ward v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 767, 772 (1977).
     1296 A Book Named “John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure” v. Attor-

ney Genera, 383 U.S. 413 (1966).
     1297 383 U.S. at 418. On the precedential effect of the Memoirs plurality opin-

ion, see Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 192–94 (1977).
     1298 386 U.S. 767 (1967).
     1299 386 U.S. at 771.
     1300 386 U.S. at 770–71. The majority was thus composed of Chief Justice War-

ren and Justices Black, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, and Fortas.
