Cable Television
    The Court has recognized that cable television “implicates First
Amendment interests,” because a cable operator communicates ideas
through selection of original programming and through exercise of
editorial discretion in determining which stations to include in its
offering.1108 Moreover, “settled principles of . . . First Amendment
jurisprudence” govern review of cable regulation; cable is not lim-
ited by “scarce” broadcast frequencies and does not require the same
less rigorous standard of review that the Court applies to regula-
tion of broadcasting.1109 Cable does, however, have unique charac-
teristics that justify regulations that single out cable for special treat-
ment.1110 The Court in Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC 1111 upheld
federal statutory requirements that cable systems carry local com-
mercial and public television stations. Although these “must-carry”
requirements “distinguish between speakers in the television pro-
gramming market,” they do so based on the manner of transmis-
sion and not on the content the messages conveyed, and hence are
content-neutral.1112 The regulations could therefore be measured by
the “intermediate level of scrutiny” set forth in United States v.
O’Brien.1113 Two years later, however, a splintered Court could not
agree on what standard of review to apply to content-based restric-
tions of cable broadcasts. Striking down a requirement that cable
operators must, in order to protect children, segregate and block
programs with patently offensive sexual material, a Court majority

     1108 City of Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, 476 U.S. 488 (1986) (leav-

ing for future decision how the operator’s interests are to be balanced against a com-
munity’s interests in limiting franchises and preserving utility space); Turner Broad-
casting System v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 636 (1994).
     1109 Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 638–39 (1994).
     1110 512 U.S. at 661 (referring to the “bottleneck monopoly power” exercised by

cable operators in determining which networks and stations to carry, and to the re-
sulting dangers posed to the viability of broadcast television stations). See also Leath-
ers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. 439 (1991) (application of state gross receipts tax to cable
industry permissible even though other segments of the communications media were
exempted).
     1111 512 U.S. 622 (1994).
     1112 512 U.S. at 645. “Deciding whether a particular regulation is content-based

or content-neutral is not always a simple task,” the Court confessed. Id. at 642. In-
deed, dissenting Justice O’Connor, joined by Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, and Thomas,
viewed the rules as content-based. Id. at 674–82.
     1113 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). The Court remanded Turner for further factual

findings relevant to the O’Brien test. On remand, the district court upheld the must-
carry provisions, and the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that it “cannot dis-
place Congress’s judgment respecting content-neutral regulations with our own, so
long as its policy is grounded on reasonable factual findings supported by evidence
that is substantial for a legislative determination.” Turner Broadcasting System v.
FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 224 (1997).
