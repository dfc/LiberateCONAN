public forum. Exclusion of various advocacy groups from participa-
tion in the Campaign was upheld as furthering “reasonable” govern-
mental interests in offering a forum to “traditional health and wel-
fare charities,” avoiding the appearance of governmental favoritism
of particular groups or viewpoints, and avoiding disruption of the
federal workplace by controversy.1420 The Court pinpointed the gov-
ernment’s intention as the key to whether a public forum has been
created: “The government does not create a public forum by inac-
tion or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally
opening a non-traditional forum for public discourse.” 1421 Under this
categorical approach, the government has wide discretion in main-
taining the nonpublic character of its forums, and may regulate in
ways that would be impermissible were it to designate a limited
public forum.1422
     Application of the doctrine continues to create difficulty. A ma-
jority of Justices could not agree on the public forum status of a
sidewalk located entirely on Postal Service property.1423 The Court
was also divided over whether nonsecured areas of an airport ter-
minal, including shops and restaurants, constituted a public fo-
rum. Holding that the terminal was not a public forum, the Court
upheld restrictions on the solicitation and receipt of funds.1424 But
the Court also invalidated a ban on the sale or distribution of lit-
erature to passers-by within the same terminal, four Justices believ-
ing that the terminal constituted a public forum, and Justice



     1420 Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 473 U.S. 788 (1985).

The precedential value of Cornelius may be subject to question, because it was de-
cided by 4–3 vote, the non-participating Justices (Marshall and Powell) having dis-
sented in Perry. Justice O’Connor wrote the opinion of the Court, joined by Chief
Justice Burger and by Justices White and Rehnquist. Justice Blackmun, joined by
Justice Brennan, dissented, and Justice Stevens dissented separately.
     1421 473 U.S. at 802. Justice Blackmun criticized “the Court’s circular reasoning

that the CFC is not a limited public forum because the Government intended to
limit the forum to a particular class of speakers.” Id. at 813–14.
     1422 Justice Kennedy criticized this approach in ISKCON v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672,

695 (1992) (concurring), contending that recognition of government’s authority to des-
ignate the forum status of property ignores the nature of the First Amendment as
“a limitation on government, not a grant of power.” Justice Brennan voiced similar
misgivings in his dissent in United States v. Kokinda: “public forum categories—
originally conceived of as a way of preserving First Amendment rights—have been
used . . . as a means of upholding restrictions on speech.” 497 U.S. at 741 (empha-
sis in original) (citation omitted).

tion on the sidewalk).
