values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.” 955 No such
findings had been made by the state court, which had ordered closed,
in the interest of protecting the privacy interests of some prospec-
tive jurors, 41 of the 44 days of voir dire in a rape-murder case.
The trial court also had not considered the possibility of less restric-
tive alternatives, e.g., in camera consideration of jurors’ requests for
protection from publicity. In Waller v. Georgia,956 the Court held that
“under the Sixth Amendment any closure of a suppression hearing
over the objections of the accused must meet the tests set out in
Press Enterprise,” 957 and noted that the need for openness at sup-
pression hearings “may be particularly strong” because the conduct
of police and prosecutor is often at issue.958 And, in Press Enter-
prise II,959 the Court held that there is a similar First Amendment
right of the public to access to most criminal proceedings (here a
preliminary hearing) even when the accused requests that the pro-
ceedings be closed. Thus, an accused’s Sixth Amendment-based re-
quest for closure must meet the same stringent test applied to gov-
ernmental requests to close proceedings: there must be “specific
findings . . . demonstrating that first, there is a substantial prob-
ability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced
by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable al-
ternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant’s fair
trial rights.” 960 Openness of preliminary hearings was deemed im-
portant because, under California law, the hearings can be “the fi-
nal and most important step in the criminal proceeding” and there-
fore may be “the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal
justice system,” and also because the safeguard of a jury is unavail-
able at preliminary hearings.961
    Government as Administrator of Prisons.—A prison inmate
retains only those First Amendment rights that are not inconsis-
tent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penologi-
cal objectives of the corrections system.962 The identifiable govern-
mental interests at stake in administration of prisons are the
preservation of internal order and discipline, the maintenance of
institutional security against escape or unauthorized entry, and the

     957 Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368 (1979), did not involve assertion by

the accused of his 6th Amendment right to a public trial; instead, the accused in
that case had requested closure. “[T]he constitutional guarantee of a public trial is
for the benefit of the defendant.” Id. at 381.
