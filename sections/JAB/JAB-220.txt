    Seditious Speech and Seditious Libel.—Opposition to gov-
ernment through speech alone has been subject to punishment
throughout much of history under laws proscribing “seditious” ut-
terances. In this country, the Sedition Act of 1798 made criminal,
inter alia, malicious writings that defamed, brought into contempt
or disrepute, or excited the hatred of the people against the govern-
ment, the President, or the Congress, or that stirred people to sedi-
tion.1151 In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,1152 the Court surveyed
the controversy surrounding the enactment and enforcement of the
Sedition Act and concluded that debate “first crystallized a na-
tional awareness of the central meaning of the First Amend-
ment. . . . Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court,
the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of his-
tory . . . . [That history] reflect[s] a broad consensus that the Act,
because of the restraint it imposed upon criticism of government
and public officials, was inconsistent with the First Amendment.”
The “central meaning” discerned by the Court, quoting Madison’s
comment that in a republican government “the censorial power is
in the people over the Government, and not in the Government over
the people,” is that “[t]he right of free public discussion of the stew-
ardship of public officials was thus, in Madison’s view, a fundamen-
tal principle of the American form of government.”
    Little opportunity to apply this concept of the “central mean-
ing” of the First Amendment in the context of sedition and crimi-
nal syndicalism laws has been presented to the Court. In Dombrowski
v. Pfister 1153 the Court, after expanding on First Amendment con-
siderations the discretion of federal courts to enjoin state court pro-
ceedings, struck down as vague and as lacking due process proce-
dural protections certain features of a state “Subversive Activities

    1151  Ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596. Note also that the 1918 amendment of the Espionage
Act of 1917, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553, reached “language intended to bring the form of
government of the United States . . . or the Constitution . . . or the flag . . . or the
uniform of the Army or Navy into contempt, scorn, contumely, or disrepute.” Cf. Abrams
v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919). For a brief history of seditious libel here and
in Great Britain, see Z. CHAFEE, FREE SPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES 19–35, 497–516 (1941).

     1153 380 U.S. 479, 492–96 (1965). A number of state laws were struck down by

three-judge district courts pursuant to the latitude prescribed by this case. E.g., Ware
v. Nichols, 266 F. Supp. 564 (N.D. Miss. 1967) (criminal syndicalism law); Carmichael
v. Allen, 267 F. Supp. 985 (N.D. Ga. 1966) (insurrection statute); McSurely v. Ratliff,
282 F. Supp. 848 (E.D. Ky. 1967) (criminal syndicalism). This latitude was then cir-
cumscribed in cases attacking criminal syndicalism and criminal anarchy laws. Younger
v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66 (1971).
