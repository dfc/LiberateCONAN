prior restraint to commercial speech.” 422 “Some circuits [however]
have explicitly indicated that the requirement of procedural safe-
guards in the context of a prior restraint indeed applies to commer-
cial speech.” 423 In addition, prior restraint is generally permitted,
even in the form of preliminary injunctions, in intellectual prop-

     Injunctions and the Press in Fair Trial Cases.—Confront-
ing a claimed conflict between free press and fair trial guarantees,
the Court unanimously set aside a state court injunction barring

used the Learned Hand formulation of the “clear and present dan-

tent of pretrial news coverage; (b) whether other measures would
be likely to mitigate the effects of unrestrained pretrial publicity;
and (c) how effectively a restraining order would operate to pre-
vent the threatened danger.” 427 Though the Court found that one
seeking a restraining order must meet “the heavy burden of demon-
strating, in advance of trial, that without a prior restraint a fair
trial would be denied,” it refused to “rule out the possibility of show-

Justice Burger, concurred in by Justices Blackmun and Rehnquist, and, also writing
brief concurrences, Justices White and Powell). Applying the tests, the Chief Justice
agreed that (a) there was intense and pervasive pretrial publicity and more could
be expected, but that (b) the lower courts had made little effort to assess the pros-
pects of other methods of preventing or mitigating the effects of such publicity and
that (c) in any event the restraining order was unlikely to have the desired effect of
protecting the defendant’s rights. Id. at 562–67.
