in 1990, the Court reversed direction in Employment Division v.
Smith,290 confining application of the “compelling interest” test to a
narrow category of cases.
     In early cases the Court sustained the power of a state to ex-
clude from its schools children who because of their religious be-
liefs would not participate in the salute to the flag,291 only within a
short time to reverse itself and condemn such exclusions, but on
speech grounds rather than religious grounds.292 Also, the Court
seemed to be clearly of the view that government could compel those
persons religiously opposed to bearing arms to take an oath to do
so or to receive training to do so,293 only in later cases to cast doubt
on this resolution by statutory interpretation,294 and still more re-
cently to leave the whole matter in some doubt.295
     Braunfeld v. Brown 296 held that the Free Exercise Clause did
not mandate an exemption from Sunday Closing Laws for an Ortho-
dox Jewish merchant who observed Saturday as the Sabbath and
was thereby required to be closed two days of the week rather than
one. This requirement did not prohibit any religious practices, the
Court’s plurality pointed out, but merely regulated secular activity
in a manner making religious exercise more expensive.297 “If the
State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power,
the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State’s secular

     292 West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). On the

same day, the Court held that a state may not forbid the distribution of literature
urging and advising on religious grounds that citizens refrain from saluting the flag.

interpreting the naturalization law as denying citizenship to a conscientious objec-
tor who would not swear to bear arms in defense of the country), all three of which
were overruled by Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61 (1946), on strictly statu-
tory grounds. See also Hamilton v. Board of Regents, 293 U.S. 245 (1934) (uphold-

to admit applicant to bar because as conscientious objector he could not take re-
quired oath).
