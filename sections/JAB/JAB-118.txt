    Thus, a right to associate to further political and social views
is protected against unreasonable burdening,600 but the evolution
of this right in recent years has passed far beyond the relatively
narrow contexts in which it was born.
    Social contacts that do not occur in the context of an “orga-
nized association” may be unprotected, however. In holding that a
state may restrict admission to certain licensed dance halls to per-
sons between the ages of 14 and 18, the Court declared that there
is no “generalized right of ‘social association’ that includes chance
encounters in dance halls.” 601
    In a series of three decisions, the Court explored the extent to
which associational rights may be burdened by nondiscrimination
requirements. First, Roberts v. United States Jaycees 602 upheld ap-
plication of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to prohibit the United
States Jaycees from excluding women from full membership. Three
years later in Board of Directors of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of
Duarte,603 the Court applied Roberts in upholding application of a
similar California law to prevent Rotary International from exclud-
ing women from membership. Then, in New York State Club Ass’n
v. New York City,604 the Court upheld against facial challenge New
York City’s Human Rights Law, which prohibits race, creed, sex, and
other discrimination in places “of public accommodation, resort, or
amusement,” and applies to clubs of more than 400 members pro-
viding regular meal service and supported by nonmembers for trade
or business purposes. In Roberts, both the Jaycees’ nearly indiscrimi-
nate membership requirements and the state’s compelling interest
     599 401 U.S. at 578–79. These cases do not, however, stand for the proposition

that individuals are always entitled to representation of counsel in administrative
proceedings. See Walters v. National Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305 (1985)
(upholding limitation to $10 of fee that may be paid attorney in representing veter-
ans’ death or disability claims before VA).
     600 E.g., NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 907–15 (1982) (con-

certed activities of group protesting racial bias); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169 (1972)
(denial of official recognition to student organization by public college without justi-
fication abridged right of association). The right does not, however, protect the deci-
sion of entities not truly private to exclude minorities. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.
160, 175–76 (1976); Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 469–70 (1973); Railway Mail
Ass’n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88 (1945); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609
(1984).
     601 City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 24, 25 (1989). The narrow factual

setting—a restriction on adults dancing with teenagers in public—may be con-
trasted with the Court’s broad assertion that “coming together to engage in recre-
ational dancing . . . is not protected by the First Amendment.” Id. at 25.
     602 468 U.S. 609 (1984).
     603 481 U.S. 537 (1987).
     604 487 U.S. 1 (1988).
