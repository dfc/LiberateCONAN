     In Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,865 the Court held
that Buckley v. Valeo “is authority for state limits on contributions
to state political candidates,” but state limits “need not be pegged
to Buckley’s dollars.” 866 The Court in Nixon justified the limits on
contributions on the same grounds that it had in Buckley: “prevent-
ing corruption and the appearance of it that flows from munificent
campaign contributions.” 867 Further, Nixon did “not present a close
call requiring further definition of whatever the State’s evidentiary
obligation may be” to justify the contribution limits, as “there is
little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work
actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question
the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.” 868 As for
the amount of the contribution limits, Missouri’s fluctuated in accor-
dance with the consumer price index, and, when suit was filed, ranged
from $275 to $1,075, depending on the state office or size of constitu-
ency. The Court upheld these limits, writing that, in Buckley, it had
“rejected the contention that $1,000, or any other amount, was a
constitutional minimum below which legislatures could not regu-
late.” 869 The relevant inquiry, rather, was “whether the contribu-
tion limitation was so radical in effect as to render political associa-
tion ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate’s voice below the level
of notice, and render contributions pointless.” 870
    Outside the context of contributions to candidates, however, the
Court has not been convinced of the justifications for limiting such
uses of money for political purposes. Thus, a municipal ordinance
regulating the maximum amount that could be contributed to or
accepted by an association formed to take part in a city referen-
dum was invalidated.871 Although Buckley had sustained limits on
contributions as a prophylactic measure to prevent corruption or its
appearance, no risk of corruption was found in giving or receiving

not clear from the opinion whether the Court was applying a contribution or an ex-
penditure analysis to the ordinance, see id. at 301 (Justice Marshall concurring), or
whether it makes any difference in this context.
