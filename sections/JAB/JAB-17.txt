schools. Indeed, in its most recent decisions the Court has over-
turned several of the most restrictive school aid precedents from
its earlier jurisprudence. Throughout, the Court has allowed greater
discretion with respect to aid programs benefiting religiously affili-
ated colleges and social services agencies.
     A secular purpose is the first requirement of the Lemon tripar-
tite test to sustain the validity of legislation touching upon reli-
gion, and upon this standard the Justices display little disagree-
ment. There are adequate legitimate, non-sectarian bases for legislation
to assist nonpublic, religious schools: preservation of a healthy and
safe educational environment for all school children, promotion of
pluralism and diversity among public and nonpublic schools, and
prevention of overburdening of the public school system that would
accompany the financial failure of private schools.66
     The primary secular effect and no excessive entanglement as-
pects of the Lemon test, however, have proven much more divisive.
As a consequence, the Court’s applications of these tests have not
always been consistent, and the rules guiding their application have
not always been easy to decipher. Moreover, in its most recent deci-
sions the Court has substantially modified the strictures these tests
have previously imposed on public aid to pervasively sectarian en-
tities.
     In applying the primary effect and excessive entanglement tests,
the Court has drawn a distinction between public aid programs that
directly aid sectarian entities and those that do so only indirectly.
Aid provided directly, the Court has said, must be limited to secu-
lar use lest it have a primary effect of advancing religion. The Es-
tablishment Clause “absolutely prohibit[s] government-financed or
government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particu-
lar religious faith.” 67 The government may provide direct support
to the secular services and programs sponsored by religious enti-
ties, but it cannot directly subsidize such organizations’ religious
activities or proselytizing.68 Thus, the Court struck down as uncon-
stitutional a program providing grants for the maintenance and re-
pair of sectarian elementary and secondary school facilities, be-
cause the grants had no restrictions to prevent their use for such
purposes as defraying the costs of building or maintaining chapels
