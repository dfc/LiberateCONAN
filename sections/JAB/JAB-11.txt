eliminate a principal distinction between the Establishment Clause
and the Free Exercise Clause and make the former a “virtual nul-
lity.” 32 Justice O’Connor has suggested “endorsement” as a clarifi-
cation of the Lemon test; i.e., that the Establishment Clause is vio-
lated if the government intends its action to endorse or disapprove
of religion or if a “reasonable observer” would perceive the govern-
ment’s action as such an endorsement or disapproval.33 But others
have criticized that test as too amorphous to provide adequate guid-
ance.34 Justice O’Connor has also suggested that it may be inappro-
priate to try to shoehorn all Establishment Clause cases into one
test, and has called instead for recognition that different contexts
may call for different approaches.35 In two Establishment Clause
decisions, the Court employed all three tests in one decision 36 and
relied primarily on a modified version of the Lemon tests in the other.37
    In interpreting and applying the Free Exercise Clause, the Court
has consistently held religious beliefs to be absolutely immune from
governmental interference.38 But it has used a number of stan-
dards to review government action restrictive of religiously moti-
vated conduct, ranging from formal neutrality 39 to clear and pres-
ent danger 40 to strict scrutiny.41 For cases of intentional governmental
discrimination against religion, the Court still employs strict scru-
tiny 42 But for most other free exercise cases it has now reverted to
a standard of formal neutrality. “[T]he right of free exercise,” it has
stated, “does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply
