the standard of restraint on governmental action.20 The concept of
neutrality itself is “a coat of many colors,” 21 and three standards
that seemingly could be stated in objective fashion emerged as tests
of Establishment Clause validity. The first two standards emerged
together. “The test may be stated as follows: what are the purpose
and the primary effect of the enactment? If either is the advance-
ment or inhibition of religion then the enactment exceeds the scope
of legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution. That is
to say that to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause
there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect
that neither advances nor inhibits religion.” 22 The third test emerged
several years later and asks whether the governmental program re-
sults in “an excessive government entanglement with religion. The
test is inescapably one of degree . . . [T]he questions are whether
the involvement is excessive, and whether it is a continuing one
calling for official and continuing surveillance leading to an imper-
missible degree of entanglement.” 23 In 1971, these three tests were
combined and restated in Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for the Court
in Lemon v. Kurtzman,24 and are frequently referred to by refer-
ence to that case name.
    Although at one time accepted in principle by all the Jus-
tices,25 the tests have sometimes been difficult to apply,26 have re-

U.S. 664, 694–97 (1970) (Justice Harlan concurring). In the opinion of the Court in
Walz, Chief Justice Burger wrote: “The course of constitutional neutrality in this
area cannot be an absolutely straight line; rigidity could well defeat the basic pur-
pose of these provisions, which is to insure that no religion be sponsored or favored,
none commanded, and none inhibited. The general principle deducible from the First
Amendment and all that has been said by the Court is this: that we will not toler-
ate either governmentally established religion or governmental interference with re-
ligion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is room for play
in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exer-
cise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.” Id. at 669.

and are at best “guidelines” rather than a “constitutional caliper”; they must be used
to consider “the cumulative criteria developed over many years and applying to a
wide range of governmental action.” Inevitably, “no ‘bright line’ guidance is af-
forded.” Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 677–78 (1971). See also Committee for
