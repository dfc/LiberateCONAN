    In certain other contexts, the Court has relied on “common sense”
rather than requiring the government to demonstrate that a re-
cited harm was real and not merely conjectural. For example, it held
that a rule prohibiting high school coaches from recruiting middle
school athletes did not violate the First Amendment, finding that it
needed “no empirical data to credit [the] common-sense conclusion
that hard-sell [speech] tactics directed at middle school students could
lead to exploitation . . . .” 540 On the use of common sense in free
speech cases, Justice Souter wrote: “It is not that common sense is
always illegitimate in First Amendment demonstration. The need
for independent proof varies with the point that has to be estab-
lished . . . . But we must be careful about substituting common as-
sumptions for evidence when the evidence is as readily available
as public statistics and municipal property evaluations, lest we find
out when the evidence is gathered that the assumptions are highly
debatable.” 541
    Is There a Present Test?.—Complexities inherent in the myriad
varieties of expression encompassed by the First Amendment guar-
antees of speech, press, and assembly probably preclude any single
standard for determining the presence of First Amendment protec-
tion. For certain forms of expression for which protection is claimed,
the Court engages in “definitional balancing” to determine that those
forms are outside the range of protection.542 Balancing is in evi-
dence to enable the Court to determine whether certain covered speech
is entitled to protection in the particular context in which the ques-
tion arises.543 Use of vagueness, overbreadth, and less intrusive means
may very well operate to reduce the number of occasions when ques-
tions of protection must be answered squarely on the merits. What
is observable, however, is the re-emergence, at least in a tentative
     540 Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass’n v. Brentwood Academy, 551 U.S.

291, 300 (2007).
     541 City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425, 459 (2002) (Souter,

J., dissenting).
     542 Thus, obscenity, by definition, is outside the coverage of the First Amend-

ment, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,
413 U.S. 49 (1973), as are malicious defamation, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254 (1964), and “fighting words,” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S.
568 (1942). The Court must, of course, decide in each instance whether the ques-
tioned expression, as a matter of definition, falls within one of these or another cat-
egory. See, e.g., Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S.
518 (1972).
     543 E.g., the multifaceted test for determining when commercial speech is pro-

tected, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980); the
standard for determining when expressive conduct is protected, United States v. O’Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968); the elements going into decision with respect to access at
trials, Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 606–10 (1982); and the
test for reviewing press “gag orders” in criminal trials, Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stu-
art, 427 U.S. 539, 562–67 (1976), are but a few examples.
