it is in the public interest. State interests asserted in support of
the ban—protection of professionalism and the quality of prescrip-
tion goods—were found either badly served or not served by the stat-
ute.1021
     Turning from the interests of consumers to receive information
to the asserted right of advertisers to communicate, the Court voided
several restrictions. The Court voided a municipal ordinance that
barred the display of “For sale” and “Sold” signs on residential lawns,
purportedly so as to limit “white flight” resulting from a “fear psy-
chology” that developed among white residents following sale of homes
to nonwhites. The right of owners to communicate their intention
to sell a commodity and the right of potential buyers to receive the
message was protected, the Court determined; the community inter-
est could have been achieved by less restrictive means and in any
event may not be achieved by restricting the free flow of truthful
information.1022 Similarly, deciding a question it had reserved in the
Virginia Pharmacy case, the Court held that a state could not for-
bid lawyers from advertising the prices they charged for the perfor-
mance of routine legal services.1023 None of the proffered state jus-
tifications for the ban was deemed sufficient to overcome the private
and societal interest in the free exchange of this form of speech.1024
Nor may a state categorically prohibit attorney advertising through
mailings that target persons known to face particular legal prob-
lems,1025 or prohibit an attorney from holding himself out as a cer-

any substantial governmental interest was served by the restraints).
     1025 Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Ass’n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). Shapero was distin-

guished in Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618 (1995), a 5–4 decision up-
holding a prohibition on targeted direct-mail solicitations to victims and their rela-
tives for a 30-day period following an accident or disaster. “Shapero dealt with a
broad ban on all direct mail solicitations” (id. at 629), the Court explained, and was
not supported, as Florida’s more limited ban was, by findings describing the harms
to be prevented by the ban. Dissenting Justice Kennedy disagreed that there was a
valid distinction, pointing out that in Shapero the Court had said that “the mode of
communication [mailings versus potentially more abusive in-person solicitation] makes
all the difference,” and that mailings were at issue in both Shapero and Florida
Bar. 515 U.S. at 637 (quoting Shapero, 486 U.S. at 475).
