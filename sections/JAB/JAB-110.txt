or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or
act their faith therein.” 549 Speaking in the context of religious free-
dom, the Court said that, although the freedom to act on one’s be-
liefs could be limited, the freedom to believe what one will “is abso-
lute.” 550 But matters are not so simple.
    Flag Salutes and Other Compelled Speech.—One question
that has arisen is whether the government may compel a person to
publicly declare or affirm a personal belief. In Minersville School
District v. Gobitis,551 the Court had upheld the power of Pennsylva-
nia to expel from its schools certain children—Jehovah’s Witnesses—
who refused upon religious grounds to join in a flag salute cer-
emony and recite the pledge of allegiance. “Conscientious scruples
have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration,
relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed
at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs.” 552 But three years
later, in West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,553 a six-to-
three majority of the Court overturned Gobitis.554 Justice Jackson,
writing for the Court, chose to ignore the religious argument and
to ground the decision upon freedom of speech. The state policy, he
said, constituted “a compulsion of students to declare a belief. . . .
It requires the individual to communicate by word and sign his ac-
ceptance of the political ideas [the flag] bespeaks.” 555 The power of
a state to follow a policy that “requires affirmation of a belief and
an attitude of mind,” however, is limited by the First Amendment,
which, under the standard then prevailing, required the state to
prove that for the students to remain passive during the ritual “cre-
ates a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to
muffle expression.” 556

     552 310 U.S. at 594. Justice Stone alone dissented, arguing that the First Amend-

ment religion and speech clauses forbade coercion of “these children to express a
sentiment which, as they interpret it, they do not entertain, and which violates their
deepest religious convictions.” Id. at 601.
     553 319 U.S. 624 (1943).
     554 Justice Frankfurter dissented at some length, denying that the First Amend-

ment authorized the Court “to deny to the State of West Virginia the attainment of
that which we all recognize as a legitimate legislative end, namely, the promotion of
good citizenship, by employment of the means here chosen.” 319 U.S. at 646, 647.
Justices Roberts and Reed simply noted their continued adherence to Gobitis. Id. at
