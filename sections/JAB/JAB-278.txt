tected; although violence was not protected, its existence alone did
not deprive the other activities of First Amendment coverage. Thus,
speeches and nonviolent picketing, both to inform the merchants of
grievances and to encourage other blacks to join the boycott, were
protected activities, and association for those purposes was also pro-
tected.1469 That some members of the group might have engaged in
violence or might have advocated violence did not result in loss of
protection for association, absent a showing that those associating
had joined with intent to further the unprotected activities.1470 Nor
was protection to be denied because nonparticipants had been urged
to join by speech, by picketing, by identification, by threats of so-
cial ostracism, and by other expressive acts: “[s]peech does not lose
its protected character . . . simply because it may embarrass oth-
ers or coerce them into action.” 1471 The boycott had a disruptive
effect upon local economic conditions and resulted in loss of busi-
ness for the merchants, but these consequences did not justify sup-
pression of the boycott. Government may certainly regulate certain
economic activities having an incidental effect upon speech (e.g., la-
bor picketing or business conspiracies to restrain competition),1472
but that power of government does not extend to suppression of pick-
eting and other boycott activities involving, as this case did, speech
upon matters of public affairs with the intent of affecting govern-
mental action and motivating private actions to achieve racial equal-
ity.1473
     The critical issue, however, had been the occurrence of violent
acts and the lower court’s conclusion that they deprived otherwise

    1470  458 U.S. at 908.
     1471 458 U.S. at 910. The Court cited Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 537 (1945),

a labor picketing case, and Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415,
419 (1971), a public issues picketing case, which had also relied on the labor cases.
Compare NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, 447 U.S. 607, 618–19 (1980) (Justice Ste-
vens concurring) (labor picketing that coerces or “signals” others to engage in activ-
ity that violates valid labor policy, rather than attempting to engage reason, prohibitable).
To the contention that liability could be imposed on “store watchers” and on a group
known as “Black Hats” who also patrolled stores and identified black patronizers of
the businesses, the Court did not advert to the “signal” theory. “There is nothing
unlawful in standing outside a store and recording names. Similarly, there is noth-
ing unlawful in wearing black hats, although such apparel may cause apprehension
in others.” 458 U.S. at 925.
     1472 See, e.g., FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass’n, 493 U.S. 411 (1990)

(upholding application of per se antitrust liability to trial lawyers association’s boy-
cott designed to force higher fees for representation of indigent defendants by court-
appointed counsel).
     1473 In evaluating the permissibility of government regulation in this context that

has an incidental effect on expression, the Court applied the standards of United
States v. O’Brien, which permits a regulation “if it is within the constitutional power
of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest;
if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and
