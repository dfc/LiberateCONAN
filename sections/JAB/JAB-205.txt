     Taxation.—Disclaiming any intimation “that the owners of news-
papers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for
support of the government,” the Court voided a state two-percent
tax on the gross receipts of advertising in newspapers with a circu-
lation exceeding 20,000 copies a week.1070 In the Court’s view, the
tax was analogous to the 18th-century English practice of imposing
advertising and stamp taxes on newspapers for the express pur-
pose of pricing the opposition penny press beyond the means of the
mass of the population.1071 The tax at issue focused exclusively upon
newspapers, it imposed a serious burden on the distribution of news
to the public, and it appeared to be a discriminatorily selective tax
aimed almost solely at the opposition to the state administra-
tion.1072 Combined with the standard that government may not im-
pose a tax directly upon the exercise of a constitutional right it-
self,1073 these tests seem to permit general business taxes upon receipts
of businesses engaged in communicating protected expression with-
out raising any First Amendment issues.1074
    Ordinarily, a tax singling out the press for differential treat-
ment is highly suspect, and creates a heavy burden of justification
on the state. This is so, the Court explained in 1983, because such
“a powerful weapon” to single out a small group carries with it a

review that the First Amendment generally demands.” 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode
Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501 (1996) (a portion of the opinion joined by Justices Ken-
nedy and Ginsburg). Justice Thomas, similarly, wrote that, in cases “in which the
government’s asserted interest is to keep legal users of a product or service igno-
rant in order to manipulate their choices in the marketplace, the Central Hudson
test should not be applied because such an interest’ is per se illegitimate. . . .” Greater

(Thomas, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). Other decisions in which
the Court majority acknowledged that some Justices would grant commercial speech
greater protection than it has under the Central Hudson test include United States
v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 409–410 (2001) (mandated assessments, used
for advertising, on handlers of fresh mushrooms struck down as compelled speech,
rather than under Central Hudson), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S.
525, 554 (2001) (various state restrictions on tobacco advertising struck down under
Central Hudson as overly burdensome).

     1072 297 U.S. at 250–51. Grosjean was distinguished on this latter basis in Min-
