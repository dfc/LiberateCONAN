ests.625 Many restrictions upon political association have survived
this sometimes-exacting standard of review, in large measure upon
the basis of some of the governmental interests having been found
compelling.626
     If people have a First Amendment right to associate with oth-
ers to form a political party, then it follows that “[a] political party
has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes,
and to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view pro-
duce the nominee who best represents its political platform. These
rights are circumscribed, however, when the State gives a party a
role in the election process—as . . . by giving certain parties the
right to have their candidates appear on the general-election bal-
lot. Then, for example, the party’s racially discriminatory action may
become state action that violates the Fifteenth Amendment. And then
also the State acquires a legitimate governmental interest in assur-

134, 142–143 (1972); Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974); Illinois State Bd. of
Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 183 (1979).
      626 Thus, in Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 736 (1974), the Court found “compel-

ling” the state interest in achieving stability through promotion of the two-party sys-
tem, and upheld a bar on any independent candidate who had been affiliated with
any other party within one year. Compare Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 31–32
(1968) (casting doubt on state interest in promoting Republican and Democratic vot-
ers). The state interest in protecting the integrity of political parties was held to
justify requiring enrollment of a person in the party up to eleven months before a
primary election, Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752 (1973), but not to justify re-
quiring one to forgo one election before changing parties. Kusper v. Pontikes, 414
U.S. 51 (1973). See also Civil Serv. Comm’n v. National Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 413
U.S. 548 (1973) (efficient operation of government justifies limits on employee politi-
cal activity); Rodriguez v. Popular Democratic Party, 457 U.S. 1 (1982) (permitting
political party to designate replacement in office vacated by elected incumbent of
that party serves valid governmental interests). Storer v. Brown was distinguished
in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), holding invalid a requirement that
independent candidates for President and Vice-President file nominating petitions
by March 20 in order to qualify for the November ballot; state interests in assuring
voter education, treating all candidates equally (candidates participating in a party
primary also had to declare candidacy in March), and preserving political stability,
were deemed insufficient to justify the substantial impediment to independent can-
didates and their supporters. See also Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut,
479 U.S. 208 (1986) (state interests are insubstantial in imposing “closed primary”
under which a political party is prohibited from allowing independents to vote in its
primaries); California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 577 (2000) (require-
ment of a “blanket” primary, in which all registered voters, regardless of political
affiliation, may participate, unconstitutionally “forces political parties to associate
with—to have their nominees, and hence their positions, determined by—those who,
at best, have refused to affiliate with the party, and, at worst, have expressly affili-
ated with a rival.”); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S. 581 (2005) (Oklahoma statute
that allowed only registered members of a political party, and registered indepen-
dents, to vote in the party’s primary does not violate freedom of association; Oklaho-
ma’s “semiclosed primary system” distinguished from Connecticut’s closed primary
that the Court struck down in Tashjian).
