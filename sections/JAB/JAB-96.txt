ally designed to impede the course of justice.” The case presented
no situation in which someone was on trial, there was no judicial
proceeding pending that might be prejudiced, and the dispute was
more political than judicial.477 A unanimous Court in 1972 appar-
ently applied the standard to set aside a contempt conviction of a
defendant who, arguing his own case, alleged before the jury that
the trial judge by his bias had prejudiced his trial and that he was
a political prisoner. Though the defendant’s remarks may have been
disrespectful of the court, the Supreme Court noted that “[t]here is
no indication . . . that petitioner’s statements were uttered in a bois-
terous tone or in any wise actually disrupted the court proceeding”
and quoted its previous language about the imminence of the threat
necessary to constitute contempt.478
    Clear and Present Danger Revised: Dennis.—In Dennis v.
United States,479 the Court sustained the constitutionality of the Smith
Act,480 which proscribed advocacy of the overthrow by force and vio-
lence of the government of the United States, and upheld convic-
tions under it. Dennis’ importance here is in the rewriting of the
clear and present danger test. For a plurality of four, Chief Justice
Vinson acknowledged that the Court had in recent years relied on
the Holmes-Brandeis formulation of clear and present danger with-
out actually overruling the older cases that had rejected the test;
but while clear and present danger was the proper constitutional
test, that “shorthand phrase should [not] be crystallized into a rigid
rule to be applied inflexibly without regard to the circumstances of
each case.” It was a relative concept. Many of the cases in which it
had been used to reverse convictions had turned “on the fact that
the interest which the State was attempting to protect was itself
too insubstantial to warrant restriction of speech.” 481
    Here, by contrast, “[o]verthrow of the government by force and
violence is certainly a substantial enough interest for the govern-
ment to limit speech.” 482 And in combating that threat, the govern-
ment need not wait to act until the putsch is about to be executed
and the plans are set for action. “If Government is aware that a
group aiming at its overthrow is attempting to indoctrinate its mem-

that the charges made by the defendant could well have influenced the grand jurors
in their deliberations and that the fact that laymen rather than judicial officers were
subject to influence should call forth a less stringent test than when the latter were
the object of comment. Id. at 395.
