    Although the general issue is now settled, it is to be expected
that variations of the exemption upheld in Walz will present the
Court with an opportunity to elaborate the field still further.194 For
example, the Court determined that a sales tax exemption appli-
cable only to religious publications constituted a violation of the Es-
tablishment Clause,195 and, on the other hand, that application of
a general sales and use tax provision to religious publications vio-
lates neither the Establishment Clause nor the Free Exercise Clause.196
     Exemption of Religious Organizations from Generally Ap-
plicable Laws.—The Civil Rights Act’s exemption of religious or-
ganizations from the prohibition against religious discrimination in
employment 197 does not violate the Establishment Clause when ap-
plied to a religious organization’s secular, nonprofit activities. In Cor-
poration of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos,198 the Court held that a
church-run gymnasium operated as a nonprofit facility open to the
public could require that its employees be church members. Declar-
ing that “there is ample room for accommodation of religion under
the Establishment Clause,” 199 the Court identified a legitimate pur-
pose in freeing a religious organization from the burden of predict-
ing which of its activities a court will consider to be secular and
which religious. The rule applying across-the-board to nonprofit ac-
tivities and thereby “avoid[ing] . . . intrusive inquiry into religious
belief ” also serves to lessen entanglement of church and state.200




     194 For example, the Court subsequently accepted for review a case concerning

property tax exemption for church property used as a commercial parking lot, but
state law was changed, denying exemption for purely commercial property and re-
quiring a pro rata exemption for mixed use, and the Court remanded so that the
change in the law could be considered. Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, 404
U.S. 412 (1972).
     195 Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989).
     196 Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. California Bd. of Equalization, 493 U.S. 378

(1990). Similarly, there is no constitutional impediment to straightforward applica-
tion of 26 U.S.C. § 170 to disallow a charitable contribution for payments to a church
found to represent a reciprocal exchange rather than a contribution or gift. Hernan-
dez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680 (1989).
     197 Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2, makes it

unlawful for any employer to discriminate in employment practices on the basis of
an employee’s religion. Section 702, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–1, exempts from the prohibi-
tion “a religious corporation . . . with respect to the employment of individuals of a
particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corpora-
tion . . . of its activities.”
