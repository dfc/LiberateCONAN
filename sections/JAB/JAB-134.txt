under Dennis, and he could see no reason why membership that
constituted a purposeful form of complicity in a group engaging in
such advocacy should be a protected form of association. Of course,
“[i]f there were a similar blanket prohibition of association with a
group having both legal and illegal aims, there would indeed be a
real danger that legitimate political expression or association would
be impaired, but the membership clause . . . does not make crimi-
nal all association with an organization which has been shown to
engage in illegal advocacy.” 687 Only an “active” member of the Party—
one who with knowledge of the proscribed advocacy intends to ac-
complish the aims of the organization—was to be punished, the Court
said, not a “nominal, passive, inactive or purely technical” mem-
ber.688
    Disabilities Attaching to Membership in Proscribed Orga-
nizations.—The consequences of being or becoming a member of a
proscribed organization can be severe. Aliens are subject to depor-
tation for such membership.689 Congress made it unlawful for any
member of an organization required to register as a “Communist-
action” or a “Communist-front” organization to apply for a passport
or to use a passport.690 A now-repealed statute required as a condi-

    687  367 U.S. at 229.
    688  367 U.S. at 220. In Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290 (1961), the Court
reversed a conviction under the membership clause because the evidence was insuf-
ficient to prove that the Party had engaged in unlawful advocacy. “[T]he mere ab-
stract teaching of Communist theory, including the teaching of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as prepar-
ing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action. There must be some
substantial direct or circumstantial evidence of a call to violence now or in the fu-
ture which is both sufficiently strong and sufficiently pervasive to lend color to the
otherwise ambiguous theoretical material regarding Communist Party teaching, and
to justify the inference that such a call to violence may fairly be imputed to the
Party as a whole, and not merely to some narrow segment of it.” Id. at 297–98.
     689 See 66 Stat. 205 (1952), 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(6). “Innocent” membership in an

organization that advocates violent overthrow of the government is apparently insuf-
ficient to save an alien from deportation. Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522 (1954). Later
cases, however, seem to impose a high standard of proof on the government to show
a “meaningful association,” as a matter of statutory interpretation. Rowoldt v. Perfetto,
355 U.S. 115 (1957); Gastelum-Quinones v. Kennedy, 374 U.S. 469 (1963).
     690 Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, § 6, 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S.C. § 785.

The section was declared unconstitutional in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S.
500 (1964), as an infringement of the right to travel, a liberty protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. But the Court considered the case as well
in terms of its restrictions on “freedom of association,” emphasizing that the statute
reached membership whether it was with knowledge of the organization’s illegal aims
or not, whether it was active or not, and whether the member intended to further
the organization’s illegal aims. Id. at 507–14. But see Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1,
16–17 (1965), in which the Court denied that State Department area restrictions in
its passport policies violated the First Amendment, because the policy inhibited ac-
tion rather than expression, a distinction the Court continued in Haig v. Agee, 453
U.S. 280, 304–10 (1981).
