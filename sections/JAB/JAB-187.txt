retary shows more than simply a logical relation, that is, whether
he shows a reasonable relation” between the Policy and legitimate
penological objections, as Turner requires.974 The plurality con-
cluded that he had. Justices Thomas and Scalia concurred in the
result but would do away with the Turner factors because they be-
lieve that “States are free to define and redefine all types of punish-
ment, including imprisonment, to encompass various types of depri-
vation—provided only that those deprivations are consistent with the
Eighth Amendment.” 975
     Neither prisoners nor reporters have any affirmative First Amend-
ment right to face-to-face interviews, when general public access to
prisons is restricted and when there are alternatives by which the
news media can obtain information respecting prison policies and
conditions.976 Prison restrictions on such interviews do indeed im-
plicate the First Amendment rights of prisoners, the Court held,
but such rights must be balanced against “the legitimate penologi-
cal objectives of the corrections system” and “internal security within
the corrections facilities,” taking into account available alternative
means of communications, such as mail and “limited visits from mem-
bers of [prisoners’] families, the clergy, their attorneys, and friends
of prior acquaintance.” 977
     While agreeing with a previous affirmation that “news gather-
ing is not without its First Amendment protections,” 978 the Court
denied that the First Amendment imposed upon the government any
affirmative obligation to the press. “The First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments bar government from interfering in any way with a free press.
The Constitution does not, however, require government to accord
the press special access to information not shared by members of
the public generally.” 979 Pell and Saxbe did not delineate whether
the “equal access” rule applied only in cases in which there was
public access, so that a different rule for the press might follow when
general access was denied; nor did they purport to define what the
rules of equal access are. No greater specificity emerged from Houchins

     979 417 U.S. at 834. The holding was applied to federal prisons in Saxbe v. Wash-

shall argued that “at stake here is the societal function of the First Amendment in
preserving free public discussion of governmental affairs,” that the press’s role was
to make this discussion informed, and that the ban on face-to-face interviews uncon-
stitutionally fettered this role of the press. Id. at 850, 862.
