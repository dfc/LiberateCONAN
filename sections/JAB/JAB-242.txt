government would find it difficult to punish the publication of al-
most any information by a nonparticipant to the process in which
the information was developed to the same degree as it would be
foreclosed from obtaining prior restraint of such publication.1275 There
are also limits on the extent to which government may punish dis-
closures by participants in the criminal process, the Court having
invalidated a restriction on a grand jury witness’s disclosure of his
own testimony after the grand jury had been discharged.1276
    Obscenity.—Although public discussion of political affairs is at
the core of the First Amendment, the guarantees of speech and press
are broader. “We do not accede to appellee’s suggestion that the con-
stitutional protection for a free press applies only to the exposition
of ideas. The line between the informing and the entertaining is
too elusive for the protection of that basic right.” 1277 The right to
impart and to receive “information and ideas, regardless of their
social worth . . . is fundamental to our free society.” 1278 Indeed, it
is primarily with regard to the entertaining function of expression
that the law of obscenity is concerned, as the Court has rejected
any concept of “ideological” obscenity.1279 However, this function is
not the reason that obscenity is outside the protection of the First
Amendment, although the Court has never really been clear about
what that reason is.


the question affirmatively. Caution is impelled, however, by the Court’s similar res-
ervation. “We need not address all the implications of that question here, but only
whether in the circumstances of this case Landmark’s publication is protected by
the First Amendment.” 435 U.S. at 840.
     1275 See Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976).
     1276 Butterworth v. Smith, 494 U.S. 624 (1990).
     1277 Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948). Illustrative of the general

observation is the fact that “[m]usic, as a form of expression and communication, is
protected under the First Amendment.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,
790 (1989). Nude dancing is also. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 564

Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents, 360 U.S. 684 (1959). The last case involved the
banning of the movie Lady Chatterley’s Lover on the ground that it dealt too sympa-
thetically with adultery. “It is contended that the State’s action was justified be-
cause the motion picture attractively portrays a relationship which is contrary to
the moral standards, the religious precepts, and the legal code of its citizenry. This
argument misconceives what it is that the Constitution protects. Its guarantee is
not confined to the expression of ideas that are conventional or shared by a major-
ity. It protects advocacy of the opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper no
less than advocacy of socialism or the single tax. And in the realm of ideas it pro-
tects expression which is eloquent no less than that which is unconvincing.” Id. at
688–89.
