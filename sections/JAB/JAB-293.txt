whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of
speech which the Constitution protects.” 1555 Furthermore, the right
of petition has expanded. It is no longer confined to demands for “a
redress of grievances,” in any accurate meaning of these words, but
comprehends demands for an exercise by the government of its pow-
ers in furtherance of the interest and prosperity of the petitioners
and of their views on politically contentious matters.1556 The right
extends to the “approach of citizens or groups of them to adminis-
trative agencies (which are both creatures of the legislature, and
arms of the executive) and to courts, the third branch of Govern-
ment. Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of
the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one
aspect of the right of petition.” 1557
     The right of petition recognized by the First Amendment first
came into prominence in the early 1830s, when petitions against
slavery in the District of Columbia began flowing into Congress in
a constantly increasing stream, which reached its climax in the win-
ter of 1835. Finally on January 28, 1840, the House adopted as a
standing rule: “That no petition, memorial, resolution, or other pa-
per praying the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, or
any State or Territories of the United States in which it now ex-
ists, shall be received by this House, or entertained in any way what-
ever.” Because of efforts of John Quincy Adams, this rule was re-
pealed five years later.1558 For many years now the rules of the House
of Representatives have provided that Members having petitions to
present may deliver them to the Clerk and the petitions, except such
as in the judgment of the Speaker are of an obscene or insulting
character, shall be entered on the Journal and the Clerk shall fur-
nish a transcript of such record to the official reporters of debates
for publication in the Record.1559 Even so, petitions for the repeal
