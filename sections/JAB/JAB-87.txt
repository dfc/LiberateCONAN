that obscenity is not a protected form of expression.434 In Kingsley
Books v. Brown,435 the Court upheld a state statute that, though it
embodied some features of prior restraint, was seen as having little
more restraining effect than an ordinary criminal statute; that is,
the law’s penalties applied only after publication. But, in Times Film
Corp. v. City of Chicago,436 a divided Court specifically affirmed that,
at least in the case of motion pictures, the First Amendment did
not proscribe a licensing system under which a board of censors could
refuse to license for public exhibition films that it found obscene.
Books and periodicals may also be subjected to some forms of prior
restraint,437 but the thrust of the Court’s opinions in this area with
regard to all forms of communication has been to establish strict
standards of procedural protections to ensure that the censoring agency
bears the burden of proof on obscenity, that only a judicial order
can restrain exhibition, and that a prompt final judicial decision is
assured.438

  Other Tests
    Granted that the controversy over freedom of expression at the
time of the ratification of the First Amendment was limited almost
exclusively to the problem of prior restraint, nevertheless the words

residential areas and other theaters is not an impermissible prior restraint).

view”); City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D–4, L.L.C., 541 U.S. 774, 784 (2004) (“Where
(as here and as in FW/PBS) the regulation simply conditions the operation of an
adult business on compliance with neutral and nondiscretionary criteria . . . and
does not seek to censor content, an adult business is not entitled to an unusually
speedy judicial decision of the Freedman type”); Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana,
489 U.S. 46 (1989) (seizure of books and films based on ex parte probable cause hear-
ing under state RICO law’s forfeiture procedures constitutes invalid prior restraint;
instead, there must be a determination in an adversarial proceeding that the mate-
rials are obscene or that a RICO violation has occurred). But cf. Alexander v. United
States, 509 U.S. 544 (1993) (RICO forfeiture of the entire adult entertainment book
and film business of an individual convicted of obscenity and racketeering offenses,
based on the predicate acts of selling four magazines and three videotapes, does not
constitute a prior restraint and is not invalid as “chilling” protected expression that
is not obscene).
