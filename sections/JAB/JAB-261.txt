limited in application to barrooms; had it been, then the Twenty-
first Amendment would have afforded additional authority to regu-
late the erotic dancing.
     In Erie v. Pap’s A.M.,1376 the Supreme Court again upheld the
application of a statute prohibiting public nudity to an “adult” en-
tertainment establishment. Although there was again only a plural-
ity opinion, parts of that opinion were joined by five justices. These
five adopted Justice Souter’s position in Barnes, that the statute
satisfied the O’Brien test because it was intended “to combat harm-
ful secondary effects,” such as “prostitution and other criminal ac-
tivity.” 1377 Justice Souter, however, although joining the plurality
opinion, also dissented in part. He continued to believe that second-
ary effects were an adequate justification for banning nude danc-
ing, but did not believe “that the city has made a sufficient evidentiary
showing to sustain its regulation,” and therefore would have re-
manded the case for further proceedings.1378 He acknowledged his
“mistake” in Barnes in failing to make the same demand for evi-
dence.1379
    The plurality opinion found that Erie’s public nudity ban “regu-
lates conduct, and any incidental impact on the expressive element
of nude dancing is de minimis,” because Erie allowed dancers to
perform wearing only pasties and G-strings.1380 It may follow that
“requiring dancers to wear pasties and G-strings may not greatly
reduce . . . secondary effects, but O’Brien requires only that the regu-
lation further the interest of combating such effects,” not that it
further it to a particular extent.1381 The plurality opinion did not
address the question of whether statutes prohibiting public nudity
could be applied to serious theater, but its reliance on secondary
effects suggests that they could not.

tensive discourse on the expressive aspects of dance and the arts in general, and
the striptease in particular, see Judge Posner’s concurring opinion in the lower court’s
disposition of Barnes. Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081, 1089 (7th
Cir. 1990).
     1376 529 U.S. 277 (2000).
     1377 529 U.S. at 292, 291.
     1378 529 U.S. 310–311.
     1379 529 U.S. at 316.
     1380 529 U.S. at 301. The plurality said that, though nude dancing is “expres-

sive conduct,” we think that it falls “only within the outer ambit of the First Amend-
ment’s protection.” Id. at 289. The opinion also quotes Justice Stevens to the same
effect with regard to erotic materials generally. Id. at 294. In United States v. Play-
boy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 826 (2000), however, the Court wrote
that it “cannot be influenced . . . by the perception that the regulation in question
is not a major one because the speech [‘signal bleed’ of sexually oriented cable pro-
gramming] is not very important.”
     1381 529 U.S. at 301.
