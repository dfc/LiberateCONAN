citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to
provoke violent reaction.” 1159 But, in actuality, the Court has closely
scrutinized statutes on vagueness and overbreadth grounds and set
aside convictions as not being within the doctrine. Chaplinsky thus
remains formally alive but of little vitality.1160
    On the obverse side, the “hostile audience” situation, the Court
once sustained a conviction for disorderly conduct of one who re-
fused police demands to cease speaking after his speech seemingly
stirred numbers of his listeners to mutterings and threatened dis-
orders.1161 But this case has been significantly limited by cases that
hold protected the peaceful expression of views that stirs people to
anger because of the content of the expression, or perhaps because
of the manner in which it is conveyed, and that breach of the peace
and disorderly conduct statutes may not be used to curb such ex-
pression.
    The cases are not clear as to what extent the police must go in
protecting the speaker against hostile audience reaction or whether
only actual disorder or a clear and present danger of disorder will
entitle the authorities to terminate the speech or other expressive
conduct.1162 Nor, in the absence of incitement to illegal action, may


    1159 Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971). Cohen’s conviction for breach of

the peace, occasioned by his appearance in public with an “offensive expletive” let-
tered on his jacket, was reversed, in part because the words were not a personal
insult and there was no evidence of audience objection.
    1160 The cases hold that government may not punish profane, vulgar, or oppro-

brious words simply because they are offensive, but only if they are “fighting words”
that have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom they
are directed. Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972); Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105
(1973); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974); Lucas v. Arkansas, 416
U.S. 919 (1974); Kelly v. Ohio, 416 U.S. 923 (1974); Karlan v. City of Cincinnati,
416 U.S. 924 (1974); Rosen v. California, 416 U.S. 924 (1974); see also Eaton v. City
of Tulsa, 416 U.S. 697 (1974).
    1161 Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315 (1951). See also Milk Wagon Drivers v.

Meadowmoor Dairies, 312 U.S. 287 (1941), in which the Court held that a court
could enjoin peaceful picketing because violence occurring at the same time against
the businesses picketed could have created an atmosphere in which even peaceful,
otherwise protected picketing could be illegally coercive. But compare NAACP v.
Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982).
    1162 The principle actually predates Feiner. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S.

296 (1940); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949). For subsequent application,
see Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536
(1965); Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131 (1966); Gregory v. City of Chicago, 394
U.S. 111 (1969); Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564 (1970). Significant is Justice
Harlan’s statement of the principle reflected by Feiner. “Nor do we have here an
instance of the exercise of the State’s police power to prevent a speaker from inten-
tionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction. Cf. Feiner v. New York, 340
U.S. 315 (1951).” Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 20 (1970).
