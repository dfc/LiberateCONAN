of a host of variables.” 1104 The use of more than “an occasional exple-
tive,” the time of day of the broadcast, the likely audience, “and
differences between radio, television, and perhaps closed-circuit trans-
missions” were all relevant in the Court’s view.1105
    Governmentally Compelled Right of Reply to Newspapers.—
However divided it may have been in dealing with access to the
broadcast media, the Court was unanimous in holding void under
the First Amendment a state law that granted a political candidate
a right to equal space to answer criticism and attacks on his record
by a newspaper.1106 Granting that the number of newspapers had
declined over the years, that ownership had become concentrated,
and that new entries were prohibitively expensive, the Court agreed
with proponents of the law that the problem of newspaper respon-
sibility was a great one. But press responsibility, although desir-
able, “is not mandated by the Constitution,” whereas freedom is.
The compulsion exerted by government on a newspaper to print what
it would not otherwise print, “a compulsion to publish that which
‘reason tells them should not be published,’ ” runs afoul of the free
press clause.1107

(Justice Powell concurring) (“The Court today reviews only the Commission’s hold-
ing that Carlin’s monologue was indecent ‘as broadcast’ at two o’clock in the after-
noon, and not the broad sweep of the Commission’s opinion.”).
     1105 438 U.S. at 750. Subsequently, the FCC began to apply its indecency stan-

dard to fleeting uses of expletives in non-sexual and non-excretory contexts. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found this practice arbitrary and capricious
under the Administrative Procedure Act, but the Supreme Court disagreed and up-
held the FCC policy without reaching the First Amendment question. FCC v. Fox
Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–582 (2009). See also CBS Corp. v. FCC,
535 F.3d 167 (3d Cir. 2008), vacated and remanded, 129 S. Ct. 2176 (2009) (invali-
dating, on non-constitutional grounds, a fine against CBS for broadcasting Janet Jack-
son’s exposure of her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second during a Super Bowl
halftime show). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded this decision to the Third
Circuit for further consideration in light of FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. De-
cisions regarding legislation to ban “indecent” expression in broadcast and cable me-
dia as well as in other contexts are discussed under “Non-obscene But Sexually Ex-
plicit and Indecent Expression,” infra.

     1107 418 U.S. at 256. The Court also adverted to the imposed costs of the com-

pelled printing of replies but this seemed secondary to the quoted conclusion. The
Court has also held that a state may not require a privately owned utility company
to include in its billing envelopes views of a consumer group with which it dis-
agrees. Although a plurality opinion to which four Justices adhered relied heavily
on Tornillo, there was no Court majority consensus as to rationale. Pacific Gas &
Elec. v. Public Utilities Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1 (1986). See also Hurley v. Irish-
American Gay Group, 514 U.S. 334 (1995) (state may not compel parade organizer
to allow participation by a parade unit proclaiming message that organizer does not
wish to endorse).
