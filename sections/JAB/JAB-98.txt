ing membership in the Communist Party and belief in the violent
overthrow of the government.488 Chief Justice Vinson, for the Court,
rejected reliance on the clear and present danger test. “Govern-
ment’s interest here is not in preventing the dissemination of Com-
munist doctrine or the holding of particular beliefs because it is feared
that unlawful action will result therefrom if free speech is prac-
ticed. Its interest is in protecting the free flow of commerce from
what Congress considers to be substantial evils of conduct that are
not the products of speech at all. Section 9(h), in other words, does
not interfere with speech because Congress fears the consequences
of speech; it regulates harmful conduct which Congress has deter-
mined is carried on by persons who may be identified by their po-
litical affiliations and beliefs. The Board does not contend that po-
litical strikes, the substantive evil at which § 9(h) is aimed, are the
present or impending products of advocacy of the doctrines of Com-
munism or the expression of belief in overthrow of the Government
by force. On the contrary, it points out that such strikes are called
by persons who, so Congress has found, have the will and power to
do so without advocacy or persuasion that seeks acceptance in the
competition of the market.” 489
     The test, rather, must be one of balancing of interests. “When
particular conduct is regulated in the interest of public order, and
the regulation results in an indirect, conditional, partial abridge-
ment of speech, the duty of the courts is to determine which of these
two conflicting interests demands the greater protection under the
particular circumstances presented.” 490 As the interest in the re-
striction, the government’s right to prevent political strikes and the
disruption of commerce, was much more substantial than the lim-
ited interest on the other side in view of the relative handful of
persons affected in only a partial manner, the Court perceived no
difficulty upholding the statute.491
     Justice Frankfurter, in his concurring opinion in Dennis v. United
States,492 rejected the applicability of clear and present danger and
adopted a balancing test. “The demands of free speech in a demo-
cratic society as well as the interest in national security are better
served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interest,
