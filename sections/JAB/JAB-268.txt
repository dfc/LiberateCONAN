(school board business),” 1415 but, within the framework of such le-
gitimate limitations, “a content-based prohibition must be nar-
rowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.” 1416 Third,
with respect to “[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or desig-
nation a forum for public communication,” the government “may re-
serve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative or other-
wise, as long as the regulation on [sic] speech is reasonable and
not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials
oppose the speaker’s view.” 1417 The distinction between the first and
second categories, on the one hand, and third category, on the other,
can therefore determine the outcome of a case, because speakers
may be excluded from the first and second categories only for a “com-
pelling” governmental interest, whereas exclusion from the third cat-
egory need only be “reasonable.”
    The Court held that a school system did not create a limited
public forum by opening an interschool mail system to use by se-
lected civic groups “that engage in activities of interest and educa-
tional relevance to students,” and that, in any event, if a limited
public forum had thereby been created a teachers union rivaling
the exclusive bargaining representative could still be excluded as
not being “of a similar character” to the civic groups.1418 Less prob-
lematic was the Court’s conclusion that utility poles and other mu-
nicipal property did not constitute a public forum for the posting of
signs.1419 More problematic was the Court’s conclusion that the Com-
bined Federal Campaign, the Federal Government’s forum for coor-
dinated charitable solicitation of federal employees, is not a limited

this third category of public property: the “nonpublic forum.” Arkansas Educational
Television Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 679 (1998). “Although public broadcast-
ing as a general matter does not lend itself to scrutiny under the forum doctrine
[i.e., public broadcasters ordinarily are entitled to the editorial discretion to engage
in viewpoint discrimination], candidate debates present the narrow exception to this
rule.” Id. at 675. A public broadcaster, therefore, may not engage in viewpoint dis-
crimination in granting or denying access to candidates. Under the third type of
forum analysis, however, it may restrict candidate access for “a reasonable, viewpoint-
neutral” reason, such as a candidate’s “objective lack of support.” Id. at 683.
      1418 Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37 (1983). This

was a 5–4 decision, with Justice White’s opinion of the Court being joined by Chief
Justice Burger and by Justices Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O’Connor, and with Jus-
tice Brennan’s dissent being joined by Justices Marshall, Powell, and Stevens. See
also Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 (1988) (student newspaper
published as part of journalism class is not a public forum).
      1419 City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (upholding an

outright ban on use of utility poles for signs). The Court noted that “it is of limited
utility in the context of this case to focus on whether the tangible property itself
should be deemed a public forum.” Id. at 815 n.32.
