     Government as Educator.—Although the Court had previ-
ously made clear that students in public schools are entitled to some
constitutional protection,801 as are minors generally,802 its first at-
tempt to establish standards of First Amendment expression guar-
antees against curtailment by school authorities came in Tinker v.
Des Moines Independent Community School District.803 There, high
school principals had banned the wearing of black armbands by stu-
dents in school as a symbol of protest against United States’ ac-
tions in Vietnam. Reversing the refusal of lower courts to reinstate
students who had been suspended for violating the ban, the Court
set out the balance to be drawn. “First Amendment rights, applied
in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are
available to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that
either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to free-
dom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. . . . On the
other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for af-
firming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school of-
ficials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to pre-
scribe and control conduct in the schools.” 804 Restriction on expression
by school authorities is only permissible to prevent disruption of
educational discipline. “In order for the State in the person of school
officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion,
it must be able to show that its action was caused by something
more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasant-
ness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where
there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden
conduct would ‘materially and substantially interfere with the re-
quirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,’
the prohibition cannot be sustained.” 805

     801 West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) (flag

salute); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) (limitation of language curriculum
to English); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925) (compulsory school at-
tendance in public rather than choice of public or private schools).
     802 In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967). Of course, children are in some respects sub-

ject to restrictions that could not constitutionally be applied to adults. E.g., Ginsberg
v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968) (access to material deemed “harmful to minors,”
although not obscene as to adults).
     803 393 U.S. 503 (1969).
     804 393 U.S. at 506, 507.
     805 393 U.S. at 509 (quoting Burnside v. Byars, 363 F.2d 744, 749 (5th Cir. 1966).

See also Papish v. Board of Curators, 410 U.S. 667 (1973) (state university could not
expel a student for using “indecent speech” in campus newspaper). However, offen-
sive “indecent” speech in the context of a high school assembly is punishable by school
authorities. See Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986) (uphold-
ing 2-day suspension, and withdrawal of privilege of speaking at graduation, for stu-
dent who used sophomoric sexual metaphor in speech given to school assembly).
