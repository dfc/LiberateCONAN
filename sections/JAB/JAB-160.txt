student participants and audiences.” 820 Because most primary, in-
termediate, and secondary school environments are tightly struc-
tured, with few opportunities for unsupervised student expres-
sion,821 Tinker apparently has limited applicability. It may be, for
example, that students are protected for off-premises production of
“underground” newspapers (but not necessarily for attempted dis-
tribution on school grounds) as well as for non-disruptive symbolic
speech. For most student speech at public schools, however, Tin-
ker’s tilt in favor of student expression, requiring school administra-
tors to premise censorship on likely disruptive effects, has been re-
placed by Kuhlmeier’s tilt in favor of school administrators’ pedagogical
discretion.822
    In Morse v. Frederick,823 the Court held that a school could pun-
ish a pupil for displaying a banner that said, “BONG HiTS 4 JE-
SUS,” because these words could reasonably be interpreted as “pro-
moting illegal drug use.” 824 The Court indicated that it might have
reached a different result if the banner had addressed the issue of
“the criminalization of drug use or possession.” 825 Justice Alito, joined
by Justice Kennedy, wrote a concurring opinion stating that they
had joined the majority opinion “on the understanding that (a) it
goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech
that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug
use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction on speech that
can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or so-
cial issue, including speech on issues such as ‘the wisdom of the
war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.’ ” 826 As
Morse v. Frederick was a 5-to-4 decision, Justices Alito and Kenne-
dy’s votes were necessary for a majority and therefore should be
read as limiting the majority opinion with respect to future cases.

this broad category, depending upon what is meant by “designed to impart particu-
lar knowledge or skills.” See generally Stewart, The First Amendment, the Public
Schools, and the Inculcation of Community Values, 18 J. LAW & EDUC. 23 (1989).
     821 The Court in Kuhlmeier declined to decide “whether the same degree of def-

erence is appropriate with respect to school-sponsored expressive activities at the
college and university level.” 484 U.S. at 274, n.7.
     822 One exception may exist for student religious groups covered by the Equal

Access Act; in this context the Court seemed to step back from Kuhlmeier’s broad
concept of curriculum-relatedness, seeing no constitutionally significant danger of
perceived school sponsorship of religion arising from application of the Act’s require-
ment that high schools provide meeting space for student religious groups on the
same basis that they provide such space for student clubs. Westside Community Bd.
