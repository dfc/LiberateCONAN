    However, a state has been held to have a much greater counter-
vailing interest in regulating person-to-person solicitation of clients
by attorneys; therefore, especially because in-person solicitation is
“a business transaction in which speech is an essential but subordi-
nate component,” the state interest need only be important rather
than compelling.1028 Similarly, the Court upheld a rule prohibiting
high school coaches from recruiting middle school athletes, finding
that “the dangers of undue influence and overreaching that exist
when a lawyer chases an ambulance are also present when a high
school coach contacts an eighth grader.” 1029 The Court later re-
fused, however, to extend this principle to in-person solicitation by
certified public accountants, explaining that CPAs, unlike attor-
neys, are not professionally “trained in the art of persuasion,” and
that the typical business executive client of a CPA is “far less sus-
ceptible to manipulation” than was the accident victim in Ohralik.1030
A ban on personal solicitation is “justified only in situations ‘inher-
ently conducive to overreaching and other forms of miscon-
duct.’ ” 1031 To allow enforcement of such a broad prophylactic rule
absent identification of a serious problem such as ambulance chas-
ing, the Court explained, would dilute commercial speech protec-
tion “almost to nothing.” 1032
     Moreover, a statute prohibiting the practice of optometry under
a trade name was sustained because there was “a significant possi-
bility” that the public might be misled through deceptive use of the
same or similar trade names.1033 But a state regulatory commis-
sion prohibition of utility advertisements “intended to stimulate the
purchase of utility services” was held unjustified by the asserted
