front organizations” could be curbed.682 Organizations found to fall
within one or the other of these designations were required to reg-
ister and to provide for public inspection membership lists, account-
ings of all money received and expended, and listings of all print-
ing presses and duplicating machines; members of organizations which
failed to register were required to register and members were sub-
ject to comprehensive restrictions and criminal sanctions. After a
lengthy series of proceedings, a challenge to the registration provi-
sions reached the Supreme Court, which sustained the constitution-
ality of the section under the First Amendment, only Justice Black
dissenting on this ground.683 Employing the balancing test, Justice
Frankfurter for himself and four other Justices concluded that the
threat to national security posed by the Communist conspiracy out-
weighed considerations of individual liberty, the impact of the reg-
istration provision in this area in any event being limited to what-
ever “public opprobrium and obloquy” might attach.684 Three Justices
based their conclusion on findings that the Communist Party was
an anti-democratic, secret organization that was subservient to a
foreign power and that used more than speech in attempting to achieve
its ends, and was therefore subject to extensive governmental regu-
lation.685
    Punishment for Membership in an Organization That En-
gages in Proscribed Advocacy.—The Smith Act provision mak-
ing it a crime to organize or become a member of an organization
that teaches, advocates, or encourages the overthrow of govern-
ment by force or violence was used by the government against Com-
munist Party members. In Scales v. United States,686 the Court af-
firmed a conviction under this section and held it constitutional against
First Amendment attack. Advocacy such as the Communist Party
engaged in, Justice Harlan wrote for the Court, was unprotected

action and Communist-front organizations and their members were repealed in 1968.

     683 Communist Party v. SACB, 367 U.S. 1 (1961). The Court reserved decision

on the self-incrimination claims raised by the Party. The registration provisions ul-
timately floundered on this claim. Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70 (1965).

     685 367 U.S. at 170–75 (Justice Douglas dissenting on other grounds), 191 (Jus-

tice Brennan and Chief Justice Warren dissenting on other grounds). Justice Black’s
dissent on First Amendment grounds argued that “Congress has [no] power to out-
law an association, group or party either on the ground that it advocates a policy of
violent overthrow of the existing Government at some time in the distant future or
on the ground that it is ideologically subservient to some foreign country.” Id. at

     686 367 U.S. 203 (1961). Justices Black and Douglas dissented on First Amend-

ment grounds, id. at 259, 262, while Justice Brennan and Chief Justice Warren dis-
sented on statutory grounds. Id. at 278
