would “force the organization to send a message . . . that the Boy
Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behav-

    Political Association.—The major expansion of the right of as-
sociation has occurred in the area of political rights. “There can no
longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the
common advancement of political beliefs and ideas is a form of ‘or-
derly group activity’ protected by the First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments. The right to associate with the political party of one’s choice
is an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom.” 622 Usually
in combination with an equal protection analysis, the Court since
Williams v. Rhodes 623 has passed on numerous state restrictions that

the major parties or to form and join an independent political party

law schools to allow military recruiters on campus does not violate the schools’ free-
dom of expressive association because “[r]ecruiters are, by definition, outsiders who
come onto campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students—not to become
members of the school’s expressive association. This distinction is critical. Unlike
the public accommodations law in Dale, the Solomon Amendment does not force a
law school ‘to accept members it does not desire.’ ” Rumsfeld is discussed below un-
