ment for welfare benefits.” 999 Furthermore, the restriction in this
case “distorts the legal system” by prohibiting “speech and expres-
sion upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the
judicial power,” and thereby is “inconsistent with accepted separation-
of-powers principles.” 1000
     But, in United States v. American Library Association, Inc., a
four-Justice plurality of the Supreme Court upheld the Children’s
Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which provides that a public school
or “library may not receive federal assistance to provide Internet
access unless it installs software to block images that constitute ob-
scenity or child pornography, and to prevent minors from obtaining
access to material that is harmful to them.” 1001 The plurality con-
sidered whether CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the
receipt of federal assistance by requiring public libraries to limit
their freedom of speech if they accept federal funds. The plurality,
citing Rust v. Sullivan, found that, assuming that government enti-
ties have First Amendment rights (it did not decide the question),
CIPA does not infringe them. This is because CIPA does not deny a
benefit to libraries that do not agree to use filters; rather, the stat-
ute “simply insist[s] that public funds be spent for the purposes for
which they were authorized.” 1002 The plurality distinguished Legal
Services Corporation v. Velazquez on the ground that public librar-
ies have no role comparable to that of legal aid attorneys “that pits
them against the Government, and there is no comparable assump-
tion that they must be free of any conditions that their benefactors
might attach to the use of donated funds or other assistance.” 1003
     Finally, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine may have lim-
ited application on incidental restrictions on speech. In Rumsfeld v.
Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., the Supreme Court
upheld the Solomon Amendment, which provides, in the Court’s sum-
mary, “that if any part of an institution of higher education denies
military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters,
the entire institution would lose certain federal funds.” 1004 FAIR,
the group that challenged the Solomon Amendment, is an associa-
tion of law schools that barred military recruiting on their cam-
puses because of the military’s discrimination against homosexu-
als. FAIR challenged the Solomon Amendment as violating the First
