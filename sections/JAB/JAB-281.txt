more speech than necessary to serve a significant governmental in-
terest.” 1483 Regular time, place, and manner analysis (requiring that
regulation be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental
interest) “is not sufficiently rigorous,” the Court explained, “be-
cause injunctions create greater risk of censorship and discrimina-
tory application, and because of the established principle that an
injunction should be no broader than necessary to achieve its de-
sired goals.” 1484 Applying its new test, the Court upheld an injunc-
tion prohibiting protesters from congregating, picketing, patrolling,
demonstrating, or entering any portion of the public right-of-way
within 36 feet of an abortion clinic. Similarly upheld were noise re-
strictions designed to ensure the health and well-being of clinic pa-
tients. Other aspects of the injunction, however, did not pass the
test. Inclusion of private property within the 36-foot buffer was not
adequately justified, nor was inclusion in the noise restriction of a
ban on “images observable” by clinic patients. A ban on physically
approaching any person within 300 feet of the clinic unless that per-
son indicated a desire to communicate burdened more speech than
necessary. Also, a ban on demonstrating within 300 feet of the resi-
dences of clinic staff was not sufficiently justified, the restriction
covering a much larger zone than an earlier residential picketing
ban that the Court had upheld.1485
     In Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York,1486 the
Court applied Madsen to another injunction that placed restric-
tions on demonstrating outside an abortion clinic. The Court up-
held the portion of the injunction that banned “demonstrating within
fifteen feet from either side or edge of, or in front of, doorways or
doorway entrances, parking lot entrances, driveways and driveway
entrances of such facilities” what the Court called “fixed buffer
zones.” 1487 It struck down a prohibition against demonstrating “within
fifteen feet of any person or vehicles seeking access to or leaving
such facilities” what it called “floating buffer zones.” 1488 The Court
cited “public safety and order” 1489 in upholding the fixed buffer zones,
but it found that the floating buffer zones “burden more speech than
is necessary to serve the relevant governmental interests” 1490 be-
cause they make it “quite difficult for a protester who wishes to en-
gage in peaceful expressive activity to know how to remain in com-
