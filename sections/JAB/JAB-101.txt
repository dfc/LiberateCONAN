the Communist Party and its members.504 In certain other cases,
involving state attempts to compel the production of membership
lists of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and to investigate that organization, use of the balancing test re-
sulted in a finding that speech and associational rights outweighed
the governmental interest claimed.505 The Court used a balancing
test in the late 1960s to protect the speech rights of a public em-
ployee who had criticized his employers.506 Balancing, however, was
not used when the Court struck down restrictions on receipt of ma-
terials mailed from Communist countries,507 and it was not used in
cases involving picketing, pamphleteering, and demonstrating in pub-
lic places.508 But the only case in which it was specifically rejected
involved a statutory regulation like those that had given rise to the
test in the first place. United States v. Robel 509 held invalid under
the First Amendment a statute that made it unlawful for any mem-
ber of an organization that the Subversive Activities Control Board
had ordered to register to work in a defense establishment.510 Al-
though Chief Justice Warren for the Court asserted that the vice of
the law was that its proscription operated per se “without any need
to establish that an individual’s association poses the threat feared
by the Government in proscribing it,” 511 the rationale of the deci-
sion was not clear and present danger but the existence of less re-
strictive means by which the governmental interest could be accom-
plished.512 In a concluding footnote, the Court said: “It has been
suggested that this case should be decided by ‘balancing’ the gov-
ernmental interests . . . against the First Amendment rights as-
serted by the appellee. This we decline to do. We recognize that both
interests are substantial, but we deem it inappropriate for this Court
to label one as being more important or more substantial than the
other. Our inquiry is more circumscribed. Faced with a clear con-
flict between a federal statute enacted in the interests of national
