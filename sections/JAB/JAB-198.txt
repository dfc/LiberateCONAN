interests in energy consumption and avoidance of subsidization of
additional energy costs by all consumers.1034
     Although commercial speech is entitled to First Amendment pro-
tection, the Court has clearly held that it is different from other
forms of expression; it has remarked on the commonsense differ-
ences between speech that does no more than propose a commer-
cial transaction and other varieties.1035 The Court has developed the
four-pronged Central Hudson test to measure the validity of re-
straints upon commercial expression.1036
    Under the first prong of the test, certain commercial speech is
not entitled to protection; the informational function of advertising

Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm’n, 447 U.S. 530 (1980) (voiding a
ban on utility’s inclusion in monthly bills of inserts discussing controversial issues
of public policy). However, the linking of a product to matters of public debate does
not thereby entitle an ad to the increased protection afforded noncommercial speech.
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983).
     1035 Commercial speech is viewed by the Court as usually hardier than other

speech; because advertising is the sine qua non of commercial profits, it is less likely
to be chilled by regulation. Thus, the difference inheres in both the nature of the
speech and the nature of the governmental interest. Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy
v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 771–72 n.24 (1976); Ohralik v.
Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 455–56 (1978). It is, of course, important to
develop distinctions between commercial speech and other speech for purposes of
determining when broader regulation is permissible. The Court’s definitional state-
ments have been general, referring to commercial speech as that “proposing a com-
mercial transaction,” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, supra, or as “expression re-
lated solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.” Central Hudson
Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 561 (1980). It has simply viewed as non-
commercial the advertising of views on public policy that would inhere to the eco-
nomic benefit of the speaker. Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm’n, 447
U.S. 530 (1980). So too, the Court has refused to treat as commercial speech chari-
table solicitation undertaken by professional fundraisers, characterizing the commer-
cial component as “inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.”
Riley v. National Fed’n of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 796 (1988). By contrast, a mixing
of home economics information with a sales pitch at a “Tupperware” party did not
remove the transaction from commercial speech. Board of Trustees v. Fox, 492 U.S.
469 (1989). In Nike, Inc. v. Kasky, 45 P.3d 243 (Cal. 2002), cert. dismissed, 539 U.S.
654 (2003), Nike was sued for unfair and deceptive practices for allegedly false state-
ments it made concerning the working conditions under which its products were manu-
factured. The California Supreme Court ruled that the suit could proceed, and the
Supreme Court granted certiorari, but then dismissed it as improvidently granted,
with a concurring and two dissenting opinions. The issue left undecided was whether
Nike’s statements, though they concerned a matter of public debate and appeared
in press releases and letters rather than in advertisements for its products, should
be deemed “ ‘commercial speech’ because they might affect consumers’ opinions about
the business as a good corporate citizen and thereby affect their purchasing deci-
sions.” Id. at 657 (Stevens, J., concurring). Nike subsequently settled the suit.
     1036 Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557 (1980). In one case,

the Court referred to the test as having three prongs, referring to its second, third,
and fourth prongs, as, respectively, its first, second, and third. The Court in that
case did, however, apply Central Hudson’s first prong as well. Florida Bar v. Went
For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 624 (1995).
