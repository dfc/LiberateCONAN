speeches, and the Court found that Evers’ “emotionally charged rheto-
ric . . . did not transcend the bounds of protected speech set forth
in Brandenburg. . . . An advocate must be free to stimulate his au-
dience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for unity and ac-
tion in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite lawless
action, they must be regarded as protected speech.” 1173 Although it
held that, under Brandenburg, Evers’ speech did not constitute un-
protected incitement of lawless action,1174 the Court also cited Watts,
thereby implying that Evers’ speech also did not constitute a “true
threat.” 1175
    In Planned Parenthood v. American Coalition of Life Activists,
the en banc Ninth Circuit, by a 6-to-5 vote, upheld a damage award
in favor of four physicians and two health clinics that provided medi-
cal services, including abortions, to women.1176 The plaintiffs had
sued under a federal statute that gives aggrieved persons a right
of action against whoever by “threat of force . . . intentionally . . .
intimidates any person because the person is or has been . . . pro-
viding reproductive health services.” The defendants had published
“WANTED,” “unWANTED,” and “GUILTY” posters with the names,
photographs, addresses, and other personal information about abor-
tion doctors, three of whom were subsequently murdered by abor-
tion opponents. The defendants also operated a “Nuremberg Files”
website that listed approximately 200 people under the label “ABOR-
TIONIST,” with the legend: “Black font (working); Greyed-out Name
(wounded); Strikethrough (fatality).” 1177 The posters and the web-
site contained no language that literally constituted a threat, but,
the court found, “they connote something they do not literally say,”
namely “You’re Wanted or You’re Guilty; You’ll be shot or killed,” 1178
and the defendants knew that the posters caused abortion doctors
to “quit out of fear for their lives.” 1179
    The Ninth Circuit concluded that a “true threat” is “a state-
ment which, in the entire context and under all the circumstances,
a reasonable person would foresee would be interpreted by those to
whom the statement is communicated as a serious expression of in-
tent to inflict bodily harm upon that person.” 1180 “It is not neces-
sary that the defendant intend to, or be able to carry out his threat;
