viewed the history of racial strife in Illinois to conclude that the
legislature could reasonably have feared substantial evils from un-
restrained racial utterances. Nor did the Constitution require the
state to accept a defense of truth, because historically a defendant
had to show not only truth but publication with good motives and
for justifiable ends.1188 “Libelous utterances not being within the area
of constitutionally protected speech, it is unnecessary . . . to con-
sider the issues behind the phrase ‘clear and present danger.’ ” 1189
     Beauharnais has little continuing vitality as precedent. Its hold-
ing, premised in part on the categorical exclusion of defamatory state-
ments from First Amendment protection, has been substantially un-
dercut by subsequent developments, not the least of which are the
Court’s subjection of defamation law to First Amendment challenge
and its ringing endorsement of “uninhibited, robust, and wide-
open” debate on public issues in New York Times Co. v. Sulli-
van.1190 In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, the Court, in an opinion by
Justice Scalia, explained and qualified the categorical exclusions for
defamation, obscenity, and fighting words. These categories of speech
are not “entirely invisible to the Constitution,” even though they
“can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because
of their constitutionally proscribable content.” 1191 Content discrimi-
nation unrelated to that “distinctively proscribable content,” how-
ever, runs afoul of the First Amendment.1192 Therefore, the city’s
bias-motivated crime ordinance, interpreted as banning the use of
fighting words known to offend on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion, or gender, but not on such other possible bases as political
affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality, was invalidated for
its content discrimination. “The First Amendment does not permit
[the city] to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who ex-
press views on disfavored subjects.” 1193

a particular race. Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993). The law has long rec-
ognized motive as a permissible element in sentencing, the Court noted. Id. at 485.
It distinguished R.A.V. as involving a limitation on speech rather than conduct, and
because the state might permissibly conclude that bias-inspired crimes inflict greater
