been, in some manner, of the press,402 but the Court’s decision in
First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti that corporations are en-
titled to assert First Amendment speech guarantees against fed-
eral and, through the Fourteenth Amendment, state, regulations causes
the evaporation of the supposed “conflict” between speech clause pro-
tection of individuals only and press clause protection of press cor-
porations as well as of press individuals.403 The issue, the Court
wrote in Bellotti, was not what constitutional rights corporations
have but whether the speech that is being restricted is protected
by the First Amendment because of its societal significance. Be-
cause the speech in Bellotti concerned the enunciation of views on
the conduct of governmental affairs, it was protected regardless of
its source; while the First Amendment protects and fosters indi-
vidual self-expression as a worthy goal, it also and as importantly
affords the public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemina-
tion of information and ideas. Despite Bellotti’s emphasis upon the
political nature of the contested speech, it is clear that the same
principle—the right of the public to receive information—governs
nonpolitical, corporate speech.404
     With some qualifications, therefore, the speech and press clauses
may be analyzed under an umbrella “expression” standard, with little,
if any, hazard of missing significant doctrinal differences.

The Doctrine of Prior Restraint
    “[L]iberty of the press, historically considered and taken up by
the Federal Constitution, has meant, principally although not exclu-
sively, immunity from previous restraints or censorship.” 405 “Any
system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bear-
     402 In Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 133 n.16 (1979), the Court noted

that it has never decided whether the Times standard applies to an individual defen-
dant. Some think they discern in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974),
intimations of such leanings by the Court.
     403 435 U.S. 765 (1978). The decision, addressing a question not previously con-

fronted, was 5-to-4. Justice Rehnquist would have recognized no protected First Amend-
ment rights of corporations because, as entities entirely the creation of state law,
they were not to be accorded rights enjoyed by natural persons. Id. at 822. Justices
White, Brennan, and Marshall thought the First Amendment implicated but not disposi-
tive because of the state interests asserted. Id. at 802. Previous decisions recogniz-
ing corporate free speech had involved either press corporations, id. at 781–83; see
also id. at 795 (Chief Justice Burger concurring), or corporations organized espe-
cially to promote the ideological and associational interests of their members. E.g.,
NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963).
     404 Commercial speech when engaged in by a corporation is subject to the same

standards of protection as when natural persons engage in it. Consolidated Edison
Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 530, 533–35 (1980). Nor does the status of a corporation as a
government-regulated monopoly alter the treatment. Id. at 534 n.1; Central Hudson
Gas & Electric Co. v. PSC, 447 U.S. 557, 566–68 (1980).
     405 Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931).
