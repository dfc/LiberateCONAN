the shopping center, the property rights of the center owner will
overbalance the expressive rights to persons who would use their
property to communicate.
     Then, the Court formally overruled Logan Valley Plaza, hold-
ing that shopping centers are not functionally equivalent to the com-
pany town involved in Marsh.1440 Suburban malls may be the “new
town squares” in the view of sociologists, but they are private prop-
erty in the eye of the law. The ruling came in a case in which a
union of employees engaged in an economic strike against one store
in a shopping center was barred from picketing the store within
the mall. The rights of employees in such a situation are generally
to be governed by federal labor laws 1441 rather than the First Amend-
ment, although there is also the possibility that state constitu-
tional provisions may be interpreted more expansively by state courts
to protect some kinds of public issue picketing in shopping centers
and similar places.1442 Henceforth, only when private property “ ‘has
taken on all the attributes of a town’ ” is it to be treated as a pub-
lic forum.1443
    Picketing and Boycotts by Labor Unions.—Though “logi-
cally relevant” to what might be called “public issue” picketing, the
cases dealing with application of economic pressures by labor unions
are set apart by different “economic and social interests,” 1444 and
consequently are dealt with separately here.
    It was in a labor case that the Court first held picketing to be
entitled to First Amendment protection.1445 Striking down a flat pro-
hibition on picketing to influence or induce someone to do some-
thing, the Court said: “In the circumstances of our times the dis-
semination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute
must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guar-
     1440 Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976). Justice Stewart’s opinion for the

Court asserted that Logan Valley had in fact been overruled by Lloyd Corp., 424
U.S. at 517–18, but Justice Powell, the author of the Lloyd Corp. opinion, did not
believe that to be the case, id. at 523.
     1441 But see Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U.S. U.S. 180 (1978).
     1442 In PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), the Court held

that a state court interpretation of the state constitution to protect picketing in a
privately owned shopping center did not deny the property owner any federal consti-
tutional rights. But cf. Pacific Gas & Elec. v. Public Utilities Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1
(1986), holding that a state may not require a privately owned utility company to
include in its billing envelopes views of a consumer group with which it disagrees, a
majority of Justices distinguishing PruneYard as not involving such forced associa-
tion with others’ beliefs.
     1443 Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507, 516–17 (1976) (quoting Justice Black’s dis-

sent in Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U.S. 308, 332–33 (1968)).
     1444 Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 276 (1951).
     1445 Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940). Picketing as an aspect of commu-

nication was recognized in Senn v. Tile Layers Union, 301 U.S. 468 (1937).
