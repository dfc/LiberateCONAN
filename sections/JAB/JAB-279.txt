protected conduct of protection. “The First Amendment does not pro-
tect violence . . . . No federal rule of law restricts a State from im-
posing tort liability for business losses that are caused by violence
and by threats of violence. When such conduct occurs in the con-
text of constitutionally protected activity, however, ‘precision of regu-
lation’ is demanded . . . . Specifically, the presence of activity pro-
tected by the First Amendment imposes restraints on the grounds
that may give rise to damages liability and on the persons who may
be held accountable for those damages.” 1474 In other words, the states
may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, but
they may not award compensation for the consequences of nonvio-
lent, protected activity.1475 Thus, the state courts had to compute,
upon proof by the merchants, what damages had been the result of
violence, and could not include losses suffered as a result of all the
other activities comprising the boycott. And only those nonviolent
persons who associated with others with an awareness of violence
and an intent to further it could similarly be held liable.1476 Be-
cause most of the acts of violence had occurred early on, in 1966,
there was no way constitutionally that much if any of the later losses
of the merchants could be recovered in damages.1477 As to the field
secretary of the local NAACP, the Court refused to permit imposi-
tion of damages based upon speeches that could be read as advocat-
ing violence, because any violent acts that occurred were some time
after the speeches, and a “clear and present danger” analysis of the
speeches would not find them punishable.1478 The award against the
NAACP fell with the denial of damages against its local head, and,
in any event, the protected right of association required a rule that

Meadowmoor Dairies, 312 U.S. 287 (1941), in which an injunction had been sus-
tained against both violent and nonviolent activity, not on the basis of special rules
governing labor picketing, but because the violence had been “pervasive.” 458 U.S.
