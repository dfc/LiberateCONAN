same extent that a private employer can,796 the public employer none-
theless has broad leeway in restricting employee speech. If the em-
ployee speech does not relate to a matter of “public concern,” then
Connick applies and the employer is largely free of constitutional
restraint.797 If the speech does relate to a matter of public concern,
then, unless the speech was made by an employee pursuant to his
duties, Pickering’s balancing test is applied, with the governmental
interests in efficiency, workplace harmony, and the satisfactory per-
formance of the employee’s duties 798 balanced against the employ-
ee’s First Amendment rights. Although the general approach is easy
to describe, it has proven difficult to apply.799 The First Amend-
ment, however, does not stand alone in protecting the speech of pub-
lic employees; statutory protections for “whistleblowers” add to the
mix.800

     796 See, e.g., Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S.

507 (1980) (political patronage systems impermissibly infringe protected belief and
associational rights of employees); Madison School Dist. v. WERC, 429 U.S. 167 (1977)
(school teacher may not be prevented from speaking at a public meeting in opposi-
tion to position advanced by union with exclusive representation rights). The public
employer may, as may private employers, permit collective bargaining and confer on
representatives of its employees the right of exclusive representation, Abood v. De-
troit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 223–32 (1977), but the fact that its employees may
speak does not compel government to listen to them. See Smith v. Arkansas State
Highway Employees, 441 U.S. 463 (1979) (employees have right to associate to pres-
ent their positions to their employer but employer not constitutionally required to
engage in collective bargaining). See also Minnesota State Bd. for Community Col-
leges v. Knight, 465 U.S. 271 (1984) (public employees not members of union have
no First Amendment right to meet separately with public employers compelled by
state law to “meet and confer” with exclusive bargaining representative). Govern-
ment may also inquire into the fitness of its employees and potential employees, but
it must do so in a manner that does not needlessly endanger the expression and
associational rights of those persons. See, e.g., Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1969).
     797 In Connick, the Court noted that it did not suggest “that Myers’ speech, even

if not touching upon a matter of public concern, is totally beyond the protection of
the First Amendment.” Rather, it was beyond First Amendment protection “absent
the most unusual of circumstances.” 461 U.S. at 147. In Ceballos, however, the Court,
citing Connick at 147, wrote that, if an employee did not speak as a citizen on a
matter of public concern, then “the employee has no First Amendment cause of ac-
tion based on his or her employer’s reaction to the speech.” 547 U.S. at 418.
     798 In some contexts, the governmental interest is more far-reaching. See Snepp

v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 509 n.3 (1980) (interest in protecting secrecy of for-
eign intelligence sources).
     799 For analysis of efforts of lower courts to apply Pickering and Connick, see

Massaro, Significant Silences: Freedom of Speech in the Public Sector Workplace, 61
S. CAL. L. REV. 1 (1987); and Allred, From Connick to Confusion: The Struggle to
Define Speech on Matters of Public Concern, 64 IND. L.J. 43 (1988). In Waters v. Churchill,
511 U.S. 661 (1994), the Court grappled with what procedural protections may be
required by the First Amendment when public employees are dismissed on speech-
related grounds, but reached no consensus.
     800 The principal federal law is the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.

L. 101–12, 103 Stat. 16, 5 U.S.C. § 1201 note.
