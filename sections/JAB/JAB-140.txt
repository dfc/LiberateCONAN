quiring all state employees to swear, inter alia, that they would not
“aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow, destroy, or
alter or assist in the overthrow, destruction, or alteration” of gov-
ernment. Although couched in vagueness terms, the Court’s opin-
ion stressed that the vagueness was compounded by its effect on
First Amendment rights and seemed to emphasize that the state
could not deny employment to one simply because he unintention-
ally lent indirect aid to the cause of violent overthrow by engaging
in lawful activities that he knew might add to the power of persons
supporting illegal overthrow.717
    More precisely drawn oaths survived vagueness attacks but fell
before First Amendment objections in the next three cases. Elfbrandt
v. Russell 718 involved an oath that as supplemented would have been
violated by one who “knowingly and willfully becomes or remains a
member of the communist party . . . or any other organization hav-
ing for its purposes the overthrow by force or violence of the govern-
ment” with “knowledge of said unlawful purpose of said organiza-
tion.” The law’s blanketing in of “knowing but guiltless” membership
was invalid, wrote Justice Douglas for the Court, because one could
be a knowing member but not subscribe to the illegal goals of the
organization; moreover, it appeared that one must also have partici-
pated in the unlawful activities of the organization before public
employment could be denied.719 Next, in Keyishian v. Board of Re-
gents,720 the oath provisions sustained in Adler 721 were declared un-
constitutional. A number of provisions were voided as vague,722 but
the Court held invalid a new provision making Communist Party
membership prima facie evidence of disqualification for employ-
ment because the opportunity to rebut the presumption was too lim-
ited. It could be rebutted only by denying membership, denying knowl-
edge of advocacy of illegal overthrow, or denying that the organization
advocates illegal overthrow. But “legislation which sanctions mem-
bership unaccompanied by specific intent to further the unlawful
goals of the organization or which is not active membership vio-
