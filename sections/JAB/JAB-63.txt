    Sherbert was reaffirmed and applied in subsequent cases involv-
ing denial of unemployment benefits. Thomas v. Review Board 303
involved a Jehovah’s Witness who quit his job when his employer
transferred him from a department making items for industrial use
to a department making parts for military equipment. While his
belief that his religion proscribed work on war materials was not
shared by all other Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Court held that it was
inappropriate to inquire into the validity of beliefs asserted to be
religious so long as the claims were made in good faith (and the
beliefs were at least arguably religious). The same result was reached
in a 1987 case, the fact that the employee’s religious conversion rather
than a job reassignment had created the conflict between work and
Sabbath observance not being considered material to the determi-
nation that free exercise rights had been burdened by the denial of
unemployment compensation.304 Also, a state may not deny unem-
ployment benefits solely because refusal to work on the Sabbath was
based on sincere religious beliefs held independently of member-
ship in any established religious church or sect.305
     The Court applied the Sherbert balancing test in several areas
outside of unemployment compensation. The first two such cases
involved the Amish, whose religion requires them to lead a simple
life of labor and worship in a tight-knit and self-reliant community
largely insulated from the materialism and other distractions of mod-
ern life. Wisconsin v. Yoder 306 held that a state compulsory atten-
dance law, as applied to require Amish children to attend ninth and
tenth grades of public schools in contravention of Amish religious
beliefs, violated the Free Exercise Clause. The Court first deter-
mined that the beliefs of the Amish were indeed religiously based
and of great antiquity.307 Next, the Court rejected the state’s argu-
ments that the Free Exercise Clause extends no protection because
the case involved “action” or “conduct” rather than belief, and be-
cause the regulation, neutral on its face, did not single out reli-
gion.308 Instead, the Court analyzed whether a “compelling” govern-
mental interest required such “grave interference” with Amish belief

unclear, as it is settled that it is improper for courts to inquire into the interpreta-
tion of religious belief. E.g., United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257 (1982).
