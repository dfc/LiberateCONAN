    Government and the Conduct of Trials.—Conflict between
constitutional rights is not uncommon. One of the most difficult to
resolve is the conflict between a criminal defendant’s Fifth and Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial and the First Amendment’s protec-
tion of the rights to obtain and publish information about defen-
dants and trials. Convictions obtained in the context of prejudicial
pre-trial publicity 940 and during trials that were media “spectacu-
lars” 941 have been reversed, but the prevention of such occurrences
is of paramount importance to the governmental and public inter-
est in the finality of criminal trials and the successful prosecution
of criminals. However, the imposition of “gag orders” on press pub-
lication of information directly confronts the First Amendment’s bar
on prior restraints,942 although the courts have a good deal more
discretion in preventing the information from becoming public in
the first place.943 Perhaps the most profound debate that has arisen
in recent years concerns the right of access of the public and the
press to trial and pre-trial proceedings, and the Court has ad-
dressed the issue.
     When the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a pub-
lic trial did not guarantee access of the public and the press to pre-
trial suppression hearings,944 a major debate flowered concerning
the extent to which, if at all, the speech and press clauses pro-
tected the public and the press in seeking to attend trials.945 The
right of access to criminal trials against the wishes of the defen-

     939 Congress enacted the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96–440, 94 Stat.

1879, 42 U.S.C. § 2000aa, to protect the press and other persons having material
intended for publication from federal or state searches in specified circumstances,
and creating damage remedies for violations.
     940 Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 (1961); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723 (1963).
     941 Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); compare Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S.

532 (1965), with Chandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560 (1981).
     942 Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976).
     943 See, e.g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030 (1991) (disciplinary

rules restricting extrajudicial comments by attorneys are void for vagueness, but such
attorney speech may be regulated if it creates a “substantial likelihood of material
prejudice” to the trial of a client); Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20 (1984)
(press, as party to action, restrained from publishing information obtained through
discovery).
     944 Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368 (1979).
     945 DePasquale rested solely on the Sixth Amendment, the Court reserving judg-

ment on whether there is a First Amendment right of public access. 443 U.S. at
