resolved without giving rise to any separate theory of associa-
tion.586
    Freedom of association as a concept thus grew out of a series of
cases in the 1950s and 1960s in which certain states were attempt-
ing to curb the activities of the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People. In the first case, the Court unanimously
set aside a contempt citation imposed after the organization re-
fused to comply with a court order to produce a list of its members
within the state. “Effective advocacy of both public and private points
of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by
group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by
remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and
assembly.” 587 “[T]hese indispensable liberties, whether of speech, press,
or association,” 588 may be abridged by governmental action either
directly or indirectly, wrote Justice Harlan, and the state had failed
to demonstrate a need for the lists which would outweigh the harm
to associational rights which disclosure would produce.
    Applying the concept in subsequent cases, the Court, in Bates
v. City of Little Rock,589 again held that the disclosure of member-
ship lists, because of the harm to “the right of association,” could
be compelled only upon a showing of a subordinating interest; ruled
in Shelton v. Tucker 590 that, though a state had a broad interest to
inquire into the fitness of its school teachers, that interest did not
justify a regulation requiring all teachers to list all organizations
to which they had belonged within the previous five years; again
struck down an effort to compel membership lists from the NAACP; 591
and overturned a state court order barring the NAACP from doing
any business within the state because of alleged improprieties.592
Certain of the activities condemned in the latter case, the Court
said, were protected by the First Amendment and, though other ac-
tions might not have been, the state could not infringe on the “right
of association” by ousting the organization altogether.593
    A state order prohibiting the NAACP from urging persons to
seek legal redress for alleged wrongs and from assisting and repre-
senting such persons in litigation opened up new avenues when the
