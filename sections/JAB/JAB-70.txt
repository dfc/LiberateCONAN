Moreover, it said, RFRA “reflects a lack of proportionality or congru-
ence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved
. . . [and] is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States’
traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the
health and welfare of their citizens.” 347 “RFRA,” the Court con-
cluded, “contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separa-
tion of powers and the federal balance.” 348
    Boerne did not close the books on Smith, however, or even on
RFRA. Although Boerne held that RFRA was not a valid exercise of
Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power as applied to restrict states,
it remained an open issue whether RFRA may be applied to the
Federal Government, and whether its requirements could be im-
posed pursuant to other powers. Several lower courts answered these
questions affirmatively,349 and the Supreme Court has applied RFRA
to the Federal Government without addressing any constitutional
questions.350
    Congress responded to Boerne by enacting a new law purport-
ing to rest on its commerce and spending powers. The Religious Land
Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) 351 imposes the same
strict scrutiny test struck down in Boerne but limits its application
to certain land use regulations and to religious exercise by persons
in state institutions.352 In Cutter v. Wilkinson,353 the Court upheld
RLUIPA’s prisoner provision against a facial challenge under the
Establishment Clause, but it did not rule on congressional power
to enact RLUIPA. The Court held that RLUIPA “does not, on its
face, exceed the limits of permissible government accommodation

     352 The Act requires that state and local zoning and landmark laws and regula-

tions which impose a substantial burden on an individual’s or institution’s exercise
of religion be measured by a strict scrutiny test, and applies the same strict scru-
tiny test for any substantial burdens imposed on the exercise of religion by persons
institutionalized in state or locally run prisons, mental hospitals, juvenile detention
facilities, and nursing homes. Both provisions apply if the burden is imposed in a
program that receives federal financial assistance, or if the burden or its removal
would affect commerce.
