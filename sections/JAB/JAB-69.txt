ship between a religious institution and its ministers.341 The Court
found that even where such law is a “valid and neutral law of gen-
eral applicability,” and even if the basis for the employment deci-
sion is not religious doctrine, the Free Exercise Clause prohibits the
application of an employment discrimination law, since enforce-
ment of such law would involve “government interference with an
internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the
church itself.” 342
     Because of the broad ramifications of Smith, the political pro-
cesses were soon used in an attempt to provide additional legisla-
tive protection for religious exercise. In the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993 (RFRA),343 Congress sought to supersede Smith
and substitute a statutory rule of decision for free exercise cases.
The Act provides that laws of general applicability—federal, state,
and local—may substantially burden free exercise of religion only
if they further a compelling governmental interest and constitute
the least restrictive means of doing so. The purpose, Congress de-
clared in the Act itself, was “to restore the compelling interest test
as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder and to guar-
antee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is
substantially burdened.” 344 But this legislative effort was partially
frustrated in 1997 when the Court in City of Boerne v. Flores 345
held the Act unconstitutional as applied to the states. In applying
RFRA to the states, Congress had exercised its power under § 5 of
the Fourteenth Amendment to enact “appropriate legislation” to en-
force the substantive protections of the Amendment, including the
religious liberty protections incorporated in the Due Process Clause.
But the Court held that RFRA exceeded Congress’s power under
§ 5, because the measure did not simply enforce a constitutional right
but substantively altered that right. “Congress,” the Court said, “does
not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.” 346
     341 An important issue in the case was determining when an employee of a reli-

gious institution was a “minister.” The Court declined to create a uniform standard,
but suggested deference to the position of the religious institution in making such a
determinination. In this case, a “called” elementary school teacher (as opposed to a
“contract” teacher) was found to be a “minister” based on her title, the religious edu-
cation qualifications required for the position, how the church and the employee rep-
resented her position to others, and the religious functions performed by the em-
ployee as part of her job responsibilities. 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–553, slip op. at 15–
