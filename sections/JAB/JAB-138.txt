a member of the Communist Party.704 For the Court, Justice Clark
perceived no problem with the inquiry into Communist Party mem-
bership but cautioned that no issue had been raised whether an
employee who was or had been a member could be discharged merely
for that reason.705 With regard to the oath, the Court did not dis-
cuss First Amendment considerations but stressed that it believed
the appropriate authorities would not construe the oath adversely
against persons who were innocent of an organization’s purpose dur-
ing their affiliation, or persons who had severed their associations
upon knowledge of an organization’s purposes, or persons who had
been members of an organization at a time when it was not unlaw-
fully engaged.706 Otherwise, the oath requirement was valid as “a
reasonable regulation to protect the municipal service by establish-
ing an employment qualification of loyalty” and as being “reason-
ably designed to protect the integrity and competency of the ser-
vice.” 707
    In the following Term, the Court sustained a state statute dis-
qualifying for government employment persons who advocated the
overthrow of government by force or violence or persons who were
members of organizations that so advocated; the statute had been
supplemented by a provision applicable to teachers calling for the
drawing up of a list of organizations that advocated violent over-
throw and making membership in any listed organization prima fa-
cie evidence of disqualification.708 Justice Minton observed that ev-
eryone had a right to assemble, speak, think, and believe as he pleased,
but had no right to work for the state in its public school system
except upon compliance with the state’s reasonable terms. “If they
do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain
their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere. Has the State thus
deprived them of any right to free speech or assembly? We think
not.” 709 A state could deny employment based on a person’s advo-
cacy of overthrow of the government by force or violence or based

gaged in forbidden advocacy.
