overbreadth.760 Subsequently, in Bush v. Lucas 761 the Court held
that the civil service laws and regulations constitute a sufficiently
“elaborate, comprehensive scheme” to afford federal employees an
adequate remedy for deprivation of First Amendment rights as a
result of disciplinary actions by supervisors, and that therefore there
is no need to create an additional judicial remedy for the constitu-
tional violation.
     The Hatch Act cases were distinguished in United States v. Na-
tional Treasury Employees Union (NTEU),762 in which the Court struck
down an honoraria ban as applied to lower-level employees of the
Federal Government. The honoraria ban suppressed employees’ right
to free expression while the Hatch Act sought to protect that right,
and also there was no evidence of improprieties in acceptance of
honoraria by members of the plaintiff class of federal employees.763
The Court emphasized further difficulties with the “crudely crafted”
honoraria ban: it was limited to expressive activities and had no
application to other sources of outside income, it applied when nei-
ther the subjects of speeches and articles nor the persons or groups
paying for them bore any connection to the employee’s job responsi-
bilities, and it exempted a “series” of speeches or articles without
also exempting individual articles and speeches. These “anomalies”
led the Court to conclude that the “speculative benefits” of the ban
were insufficient to justify the burdens it imposed on expressive ac-
tivities.764
    Government as Employer: Free Expression Generally.—In
recent decades, the Court has eliminated the “right-privilege” dis-
tinction with respect to public employees’ free speech rights. Appli-
cation of that distinction to the public employment context was epito-
mized in the famous sentence of Justice Holmes’: “The petitioner
may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no con-
stitutional right to be a policeman.” 765 The Supreme Court em-
braced this application in the early 1950s, first affirming a lower
court decision by an evenly divided vote,766 and soon after applying

     763 See 513 U.S. at 471. The plaintiff class consisted of all Executive Branch

employees below grade GS–16. Also covered by the ban were senior executives, Mem-
bers of Congress, and other federal officers, but the possibility of improprieties by
these groups did not justify application of the ban to “the vast rank and file of fed-
eral employees below grade GS–16.”Id. at 472.
