cently come under direct attack by some Justices,27 and in several
instances the Court has not applied them at all.28 Nonetheless, the
Court employed the Lemon tests in several recent Establishment
Clause decisions,29 and those tests remain the primary standard of
Establishment Clause validity. Other tests, however, have also been
formulated and used. Justice Kennedy has proffered “coercion” as
an alternative test for violations of the Establishment Clause,30 and
the Court has used that test as the basis for decision from time to
time.31 But that test has been criticized on the grounds that it would

      27 See, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 636–40 (1987) (Justice Scalia,

joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting) (advocating abandonment of the “pur-
pose” test); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 108–12 (1985) (Justice Rehnquist dissent-
ing); Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402, 426–30 (1985) (Justice O’Connor, dissenting)
(addressing difficulties in applying the entanglement prong); Roemer v. Maryland
Bd. of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 768–69 (Justice White concurring in judgment)
(objecting to entanglement test). Justice Kennedy has also acknowledged criticisms
of the Lemon tests, while at the same time finding no need to reexamine them. See,
e.g., Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 655–56 (1989). At
least with respect to public aid to religious schools, Justice Stevens would abandon
the tests and simply adopt a “no-aid” position. Committee for Public Educ. & Reli-

on the basis of historical practice); Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 587 (1992) (reject-
ing a request to reconsider Lemon because the practice of invocations at public high
school graduations was invalid under established school prayer precedents). The Court
has also held that the tripartite test is not applicable when law grants a denomina-
tional preference, distinguishing between religions; rather, the distinction is to be
subjected to the strict scrutiny of a suspect classification. Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S.
228, 244–46 (1982). See also Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1

parochial school); Board of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687 (1994)
(invalidating law creating special school district for village composed exclusively of
members of one religious sect); Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819
(1995) (upholding the extension of a university subsidy of student publications to a
student religious publication).

whether to have a student offer a prayer over the public address system prior to
home football games); and Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793 (2000) (upholding under
