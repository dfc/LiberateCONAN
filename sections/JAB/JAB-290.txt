indefinite that police, court, and jury were free to react to nothing
more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.” 1541
    The First Amendment was the basis for reversal in Spence v.
Washington,1542 which set aside a conviction under a statute pun-
ishing the display of a United States flag to which something is
attached or superimposed; Spence had hung his flag from his apart-
ment window upside down with a peace symbol taped to the front
and back. The act, the Court thought, was a form of communica-
tion, and because of the nature of the act, and the factual context
and environment in which it was undertaken, the Court held it to
be protected. The context included the fact that the flag was pri-
vately owned, that it was displayed on private property, and that
there was no danger of breach of the peace. The nature of the act
was that it was intended to express an idea and it did so without
damaging the flag. The Court assumed that the state had a valid
interest in preserving the flag as a national symbol, but left un-
clear whether that interest extended beyond protecting the physi-
cal integrity of the flag.1543
    The underlying assumption that flag burning could be prohib-
ited as a means of protecting the flag’s symbolic value was later
rejected. Twice, in 1989 and again in 1990, the Court held that pros-
ecutions for flag burning at a public demonstration violated the First
Amendment. First, in Texas v. Johnson 1544 the Court rejected a state
desecration statute designed to protect the flag’s symbolic value, and
then in United States v. Eichman 1545 rejected a more limited fed-
eral statute purporting to protect only the flag’s physical integrity.
Both cases were decided by 5-to-4 votes, with Justice Brennan writ-
ing the Court’s opinions.1546 The Texas statute invalidated in John-
son defined the prohibited act of “desecration” as any physical mis-
    1541  415 U.S. at 578.
    1542  418 U.S. 405 (1974).
     1543 418 U.S. at 408–11, 412–13. Subsequently, the Court vacated, over the dis-

sents of Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist, two
convictions for burning flags and sent them back for reconsideration in the light of
Goguen and Spence. Sutherland v. Illinois, 418 U.S. 907 (1974); Farrell v. Iowa, 418
U.S. 907 (1974). The Court, however, dismissed, “for want of a substantial federal
question,” an appeal from a flag desecration conviction of one who, with no appar-
ent intent to communicate but in the course of “horseplay,” blew his nose on a flag,
simulated masturbation on it, and finally burned it. Van Slyke v. Texas, 418 U.S.
907 (1974).
     1544 491 U.S. 397 (1989).
     1545 496 U.S. 310 (1990).
     1546 In each case Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court was joined by Justices

Marshall, Blackmun, Scalia, and Kennedy, and in each case Chief Justice Rehnquist
and Justices White, Stevens, and O’Connor dissented. In Johnson the Chief Jus-
tice’s dissent was joined by Justices White and O’Connor, and Justice Stevens dis-
sented separately. In Eichman Justice Stevens wrote the only dissenting opinion, to
which the other dissenters subscribed.
