e.g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient rea-
son to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech
and press . . . . It is therefore vital that the standards for judging
obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press
for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to pru-
rient interest.” 1285 The standard that the Court thereupon adopted
for the designation of material as unprotected obscenity was “whether
to the average person, applying contemporary community stan-
dards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole ap-
peals to prurient interest.” 1286 The Court defined material appeal-
ing to prurient interest as “material having a tendency to excite
lustful thoughts,” and defined prurient interest as “a shameful or
morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.” 1287
     In the years after Roth, the Court struggled with many obscen-
ity cases with varying degrees of success. The cases can be grouped
topically, but, with the exception of those cases dealing with protec-
tion of children, 1288 unwilling adult recipients, 1289 and proce-
dure,1290 these cases are best explicated chronologically.

    1285  354 U.S. at 487, 488.
    1286  354 U.S. at 489.
     1287 354 U.S. at 487 n.20. A statute defining “prurient” as “that which incites

lasciviousness or lust” covers more than obscenity, the Court later indicated in Brockett
v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 498 (1985); obscenity consists in appeal to
“a shameful or morbid” interest in sex, not in appeal to “normal, healthy sexual de-
sires.” Brockett involved a facial challenge to the statute, so the Court did not have
to explain the difference between “normal, healthy” sexual desires and “shameful”
or “morbid” sexual desires.
     1288 In Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957), the Court unanimously re-

versed a conviction under a statute that punished general distribution of materials
unsuitable for children. Protesting that the statute “reduce[d] the adult population
of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children,” the Court pronounced the stat-
ute void. Narrowly drawn proscriptions for distribution or exhibition to children of
materials which would not be obscene for adults are permissible, Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), although the Court insists on a high degree of specificity.
Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 390 U.S. 676 (1968); Rabeck v. New York,
391 U.S. 462 (1968). Protection of children in this context is concurred in even by
those Justices who would proscribe obscenity regulation for adults. Paris Adult The-
atre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 73, 113 (1973) (Justice Brennan dissenting). But chil-
dren do have First Amendment protection and government may not bar dissemina-
tion of everything to them. “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject
to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young
from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik
v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212–14 (1975) (in context of nudity on movie
screen). See also FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 749–50 (1978); Pinkus v.
United States, 436 U.S. 293, 296–98 (1978).
     1289 Protection of unwilling adults was the emphasis in Rowan v. Post Office Dep’t,

397 U.S. 728 (1970), which upheld a scheme by which recipients of objectionable
mail could put their names on a list and require the mailer to send no more such
material. But, absent intrusions into the home, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726 (1978), or a degree of captivity that makes it impractical for the unwilling viewer
or auditor to avoid exposure, government may not censor content, in the context of
