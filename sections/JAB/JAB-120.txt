     When application of a public accommodations law was viewed
as impinging on an organization’s ability to present its message,
the Court found a First Amendment violation. Massachusetts could
not require the private organizers of Boston’s St. Patrick’s Day pa-
rade to allow a group of gays and lesbians to march as a unit pro-
claiming its members’ gay and lesbian identity, the Court held in
Hurley v. Irish-American Gay Group.612 To do so would require pa-
rade organizers to promote a message they did not wish to pro-
mote. Roberts and New York City were distinguished as not involv-
ing “a trespass on the organization’s message itself.” 613 Those cases
stood for the proposition that the state could require equal access
for individuals to what was considered the public benefit of organi-
zation membership. But even if individual access to the parade might
similarly be mandated, the Court reasoned, the gay group “could
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with
its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude an
applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position taken
by the club’s existing members.” 614
    In Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,615 the Court held that appli-
cation of New Jersey’s public accommodations law to require the
Boy Scouts of America to admit an avowed homosexual as an adult
member violated the organization’s “First Amendment right of ex-
pressive association.” 616 Citing Hurley, the Court held that “[t]he
forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group’s
freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person af-
fects in a significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or
private viewpoints.” 617 The Boy Scouts, the Court found, engages
in expressive activity in seeking to transmit a system of values, which
include being “morally straight” and “clean.” 618 The Court “ac-
cept[ed] the Boy Scouts’ assertion” that the organization teaches that
homosexual conduct is not morally straight.619 The Court also gave
“deference to [the] association’s view of what would impair its ex-
