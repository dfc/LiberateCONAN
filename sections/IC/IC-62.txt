have his way in such matters, provided the substituted penalty is
authorized by law and does not in common understanding exceed
the original penalty.256

Scope of the Power
    The pardon power embraces all “offences against the United
States,” except cases of impeachment, and includes the power to re-
mit fines, penalties, and forfeitures, except as to money covered into
the Treasury or paid an informer,257 the power to pardon abso-
lutely or conditionally, and the power to commute sentences, which,
as seen above, is effective without the convict’s consent.258 It has
been held, moreover, in face of earlier English practice, that indefi-
nite suspension of sentence by a court of the United States is an
invasion of the presidential prerogative, amounting as it does to a
condonation of the offense.259 It was early assumed that the power
included the power to pardon specified classes or communities whole-
sale, in short, the power to amnesty, which is usually exercised by
proclamation. General amnesties were issued by Washington in 1795,
by Adams in 1800, by Madison in 1815, by Lincoln in 1863, by John-
son in 1865, 1867, and 1868, and by Theodore Roosevelt—to
Aguinaldo’s followers—in 1902.260 Not until after the Civil War, how-
ever, was the point adjudicated, when it was decided in favor of
presidential prerogative.261




     256 Biddle v. Perovich, 274 U.S. 480, 486 (1927). In Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256

(1976), the Court upheld the presidential commutation of a death sentence to impris-
onment for life with no possibility of parole, the foreclosure of parole being contrary
to the scheme of the Code of Military Justice. “The conclusion is inescapable that
the pardoning power was intended to include the power to commute sentences on
conditions which do not in themselves offend the Constitution, but which are not
specifically provided for by statute.” Id. at 264.

     259 Ex parte United States, 242 U.S. 27 (1916). Amendment of sentence, how-

ever, within the same term of court, by shortening the term of imprisonment, al-
though defendant had already been committed, is a judicial act and no infringement
of the pardoning power. United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304 (1931).
