Court struck down Massachusetts’ Burma sanctions law on the ba-
sis of statutory preemption, and declined to address the appeals court’s
alternative holding applying Zschernig.487 Similarly, in 2003, the Court
held that California’s Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act was pre-
empted as interfering with federal foreign policy reflected in execu-
tive agreements, and, although the Court discussed Zschernig at some
length, it saw no need to resolve issues relating to its scope.488
    Dictum in Garamendi recognizes some of the questions that can
be raised about Zschernig. The Zschernig Court did not identify what
language in the Constitution mandates preemption, and commenta-
tors have observed that a respectable argument can be made that
the Constitution does not require a general foreign affairs preemp-
tion not tied to the Supremacy Clause, and broader than and inde-
pendent of the Constitution’s specific prohibitions 489 and grants of
power.490 The Garamendi Court raised “a fair question whether re-
spect for the executive foreign relations power requires a categori-
cal choice between the contrasting theories of field and conflict pre-
emption evident in the Zschernig opinions.” Instead, Justice Souter
suggested for the Court, field preemption may be appropriate if a
state legislates “simply to take a position on a matter of foreign
policy with no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state re-
sponsibility,” and conflict preemption may be appropriate if a state
legislates within an area of traditional responsibility, “but in a way

     489 It is contended, for example, that Article I, § 10‘s specific prohibitions against

states engaging in war, making treaties, keeping troops in peacetime, and issuing
letters of marque and reprisal would have been unnecessary if a more general, dor-
mant foreign relations power had been intended. Similarly, there would have been
no need to declare treaties to be the supreme law of the land if a more generalized
foreign affairs preemptive power existed outside of the Supremacy Clause. See Ramsey,
supra.

§ 1 is a power to conduct foreign relations.
