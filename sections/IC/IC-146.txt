of “usurping” legislative powers,628 but still earlier ones, Washing-
ton, Jefferson, and Jackson among them, took a very different line,
albeit less boldly and persistently than their later imitators.629 To-
day, there is no subject on which the President may not appropri-
ately communicate to Congress, in as precise terms as he chooses,
his conception of its duty. Conversely, the President is not obliged
by this clause to impart information which, in his judgment, should
in the public interest be withheld.630 The President has frequently
summoned both Houses into “extra” or “special sessions” for legisla-
tive purposes, and the Senate alone for the consideration of nomi-
nations and treaties. His power to adjourn the Houses has never
been exercised.

             THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS

The Right of Reception: Scope of the Power
    “Ambassadors and other public ministers” embraces not only “all
possible diplomatic agents which any foreign power may accredit
to the United States,” 631 but also, as a practical construction of the
Constitution, all foreign consular agents, who therefore may not ex-
ercise their functions in the United States without an exequatur from
the President.632 The power to “receive” ambassadors, et cetera, in-
cludes, moreover, the right to refuse to receive them, to request their
recall, to dismiss them, and to determine their eligibility under our
laws.633 Furthermore, this power makes the President the sole mouth-
piece of the nation in its dealing with other nations.

The Presidential Monopoly
    Wrote Jefferson in 1790: “The transaction of business with for-
eign nations is executive altogether. It belongs, then, to the head of
that department, except as to such portions of it as are specially
submitted to the Senate. Exceptions are to be construed strictly.” 634
So when Citizen Genet, envoy to the United States from the first
French Republic, sought an exequatur for a consul whose commis-
sion was addressed to the Congress of the United States, Jefferson
    628 The first Harrison, Polk, Taylor, and Fillmore all fathered sentiments to this

general effect. See 4 J. Richardson, supra at 1860, 1864; 6 id. at 2513–19, 2561–62,
