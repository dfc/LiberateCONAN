     Belmont and Pink were reinforced in American Ins. Ass’n v.
Garamendi.476 In holding that California’s Holocaust Victim Insur-
ance Relief Act was preempted as interfering with the Federal Gov-
ernment’s conduct of foreign relations, as expressed in executive agree-
ments, the Court reiterated that “valid executive agreements are
fit to preempt state law, just as treaties are.” 477 The preemptive
reach of executive agreements stems from “the Constitution’s allo-
cation of the foreign relations power to the National Govern-
ment.” 478 Because there was a “clear conflict” between the Califor-
nia law and policies adopted through the valid exercise of federal
executive authority (settlement of Holocaust-era insurance claims
being “well within the Executive’s responsibility for foreign af-
fairs”), the state law was preempted.479

State Laws Affecting Foreign Relations—Dormant Federal
  Power and Preemption
    If the foreign relations power is truly an exclusive federal power,
with no role for the states, a logical consequence, the Supreme Court
has held, is that some state laws impinging on foreign relations are
invalid even in the absence of a relevant federal policy. There is, in
effect, a “dormant” foreign relations power. The scope of this power
remains undefined, however, and its constitutional basis is debated
by scholars.
    The exclusive nature of the federal foreign relations power has
long been asserted by the Supreme Court. In 1840, for example,
the Court declared that “it was one of the main objects of the con-
stitution to make us, so far as regarded our foreign relations, one
people, and one nation; and to cut off all communications between
foreign governments, and the several state authorities.” 480 A hun-
dred years later the Court remained emphatic about federal exclu-
     476 539 U.S. 396 (2003). The Court’s opinion in Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453

U.S. 654 (1981), was rich in learning on many topics involving executive agree-
ments, but the preemptive force of agreements resting solely on presidential power
was not at issue, the Court concluding that Congress had either authorized various
presidential actions or had long acquiesced in others.
