ject it to the sovereignty and authority of the United States. But
his conquests do not enlarge the boundaries of this Union, nor ex-
tend the operation of our institutions and laws beyond the limits
before assigned to them by the legislative power. . . .”
    “But in the distribution of political power between the great de-
partments of government, there is such a wide difference between
the power conferred on the President of the United States, and the
authority and sovereignty which belong to the English crown, that
it would be altogether unsafe to reason from any supposed resem-
blance between them, either as regards conquest in war, or any other
subject where the rights and powers of the executive arm of the
government are brought into question.” 114 Even after the Civil War,
a powerful minority of the Court described the role of President as
Commander-in-Chief simply as “the command of the forces and the
conduct of campaigns.” 115
    The Prize Cases.—The basis for a broader conception was laid
in certain early acts of Congress authorizing the President to em-
ploy military force in the execution of the laws.116 In his famous
message to Congress of July 4, 1861,117 Lincoln advanced the claim
that the “war power” was his for the purpose of suppressing rebel-
lion, and in the Prize Cases 118 of 1863 a divided Court sustained
this theory. The immediate issue was the validity of the blockade
that the President, following the attack on Fort Sumter, had pro-
claimed of the Southern ports.119 The argument was advanced that
a blockade to be valid must be an incident of a “public war” validly
declared, and that only Congress could, by virtue of its power “to
declare war,” constitutionally impart to a military situation this char-
acter and scope. Speaking for the majority of the Court, Justice Grier
answered: “If a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the
President is not only authorized but bound to resist force by force.
He does not initiate the war, but is bound to accept the challenge
without waiting for any special legislative authority. And whether
the hostile party be a foreign invader, or States organized in rebel-
lion, it is none the less a war, although the declaration of it be ‘uni-
lateral.’ Lord Stowell (1 Dodson, 247) observes, ‘It is not the less a
war on that account, for war may exist without a declaration on
