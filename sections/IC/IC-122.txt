again nominated and appointed.” 547 Such legislation does not con-
stitute an attempt by Congress to seize the appointing power.
Stages of Appointment Process
     Nomination.—The Constitution appears to distinguish three
stages in appointments by the President with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate. The first is the “nomination” of the candidate
by the President alone; the second is the assent of the Senate to
the candidate’s “appointment;” and the third is the final appoint-
ment and commissioning of the appointee, by the President.548
     Senate Approval.—The fact that the power of nomination be-
longs to the President alone prevents the Senate from attaching con-
ditions to its approval of an appointment, such as it may do to its
approval of a treaty. In the words of an early opinion of the Attor-
ney General: “The Senate cannot originate an appointment. Its con-
stitutional action is confined to the simple affirmation or rejection
of the President’s nominations, and such nominations fail when-
ever it rejects them. The Senate may suggest conditions and limita-
tions to the President, but it cannot vary those submitted by him,
for no appointment can be made except on his nomination, agreed
to without qualifications or alteration.” 549 This view is borne out
by early opinion,550 as well as by the record of practice under the
Constitution.
     When Senate Consent Is Complete.—Early in January, 1931,
the Senate requested President Hoover to return its resolution no-
tifying him that it advised and consented to certain nominations to
the Federal Power Commission. In support of its action the Senate
invoked a long-standing rule permitting a motion to reconsider a
resolution confirming a nomination within “the next two days of ac-
tual executive session of the Senate” and the recall of the notifica-
tion to the President of the confirmation. The nominees involved
having meantime taken the oath of office and entered upon the dis-
charge of their duties, the President responded with a refusal, say-
ing: “I cannot admit the power in the Senate to encroach upon the
executive functions by removal of a duly appointed executive officer
      547 Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U.S. 282, 301 (1893). The Court noted that

the additional duties at issue were “germane to the offices.” Id.
      548 Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137, 155–56 (1803) (Chief Justice Mar-

shall). Marshall’s statement that the appointment “is the act of the President,” con-
flicts with the more generally held and sensible view that when an appointment is
made with its consent, the Senate shares the appointing power. 3 J. STORY, COMMEN-
