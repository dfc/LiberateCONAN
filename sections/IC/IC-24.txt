state constitutions may be constrained by operation of Clause 2.83
Three Justices elaborated on this view in Bush v. Gore,84 but the
Court ended the litigation—and the recount—on the basis of an equal
protection interpretation, without ruling on the Article II argu-
ment.

Constitutional Status of Electors
     Dealing with the question of the constitutional status of the elec-
tors, the Court said in 1890: “The sole function of the presidential
electors is to cast, certify and transmit the vote of the State for Presi-
dent and Vice President of the nation. Although the electors are ap-
pointed and act under and pursuant to the Constitution of the United
States, they are no more officers or agents of the United States than
are the members of the state legislatures when acting as electors
of federal senators, or the people of the States when acting as elec-
tors of representatives in Congress. . . . In accord with the provi-
sions of the Constitution, Congress has determined the time as of
which the number of electors shall be ascertained, and the days on
which they shall be appointed and shall meet and vote in the States,
and on which their votes shall be counted in Congress; has pro-
vided for the filling by each State, in such manner as its legisla-
ture may prescribe, of vacancies in its college of electors; and has
regulated the manner of certifying and transmitting their votes to
the seat of the national government, and the course of proceeding
in their opening and counting them.” 85 The truth of the matter is
that the electors are not “officers” at all, by the usual tests of of-
fice.86 They have neither tenure nor salary, and having performed
their single function they cease to exist as electors.
     This function is, moreover, “a federal function,” 87 because elec-
tors’ capacity to perform results from no power which was origi-
nally resident in the states, but instead springs directly from the
Constitution of the United States.88

Constitution as circumscribing the legislature’s authority under Art. II, § 1, cl. 2”).
     84 Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 111 (2000) (opinion of Chief Justice Rehnquist,

joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas). Relying in part on dictum in McPherson v.
Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 27 (1892), the three Justices reasoned that, because Article II
confers the authority on a particular branch of state government (the legislature)
rather than on a state generally, the customary rule requiring deference to state
court interpretations of state law is not fully operative, and the Supreme Court “must
ensure that postelection state-court actions do not frustrate” the legislature’s policy
as expressed in the applicable statute. 531 U.S. at 113.
