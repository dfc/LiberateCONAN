plained of.” 133 This question was answered in the affirmative, as
was the similar question later raised by an exclusion order.134
    Presidential Government of Labor Regulations.—The most
important segment of the home front regulated by what were in
effect presidential edicts was the field of labor relations. Exactly six
months before Pearl Harbor, on June 7, 1941, Mr. Roosevelt, citing
his proclamation thirteen days earlier of an unlimited national emer-
gency, issued an Executive Order seizing the North American Avia-
tion Plant at Inglewood, California, where, on account of a strike,
production was at a standstill.135 Attorney General Jackson justi-
fied the seizure as growing out of the “duty constitutionally and in-
herently rested upon the President to exert his civil and military
as well as his moral authority to keep the defense efforts of the
United States a going concern,” as well as “to obtain supplies for
which Congress has appropriated the money, and which it has di-
rected the President to obtain.” 136 Other seizures followed, and on
January 12, 1942, Mr. Roosevelt, by Executive Order 9017, created
the National War Labor Board. “Whereas,” the order read in part,
“by reason of the state of war declared to exist by joint resolutions
of Congress, . . . the national interest demands that there shall be
no interruption of any work which contributes to the effective pros-
ecution of the war; and Whereas as a result of a conference of rep-
resentatives of labor and industry which met at the call of the Presi-
dent on December 17, 1941, it has been agreed that for the duration
of the war there shall be no strikes or lockouts, and that all labor
disputes shall be settled by peaceful means, and that a National
War Labor Board be established for a peaceful adjustment of such
disputes. Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, it is hereby
ordered: 1. There is hereby created in the Office for Emergency Man-
agement a National War Labor Board . . . .” 137 In this field, too,

    134  Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944). Long afterward, in 1984, a
federal court granted a writ of coram nobis and overturned Korematsu’s conviction,
Korematsu v. United States, 584 F. Supp. 1406 (N.D.Cal. 1984), and in 1986, a fed-
eral court vacated Hirabayashi’s conviction for failing to register for evacuation but
let stand the conviction for curfew violations. Hirabayashi v. United States, 627 F.
Supp. 1445 (W.D.Wash. 1986). Other cases were pending, but Congress then imple-
mented the recommendations of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Intern-
ment of Civilians by acknowledging “the fundamental injustice of the evacuation,
relocation and internment,” and apologizing on behalf of the people of the United
States. Pub. L. 100–383, 102 Stat. 903 (1988), 50 U.S.C. App. §§ 1989 et seq. Repa-
rations were approved, and each living survivor of the internment was to be compen-
sated in an amount roughly approximating $20,000.
