Congress intervened by means of the War Labor Disputes Act of
June 25, 1943,138 which, however, still left ample basis for presiden-
tial activity of a legislative character.139
     Sanctions Implementing Presidential Directives.—To imple-
ment his directives as Commander-in-Chief in wartime, and espe-
cially those which he issued in governing labor disputes, President
Roosevelt often resorted to “sanctions,” which may be described as
penalties lacking statutory authorization. Ultimately, the President
sought to put sanctions in this field on a systematic basis. The or-
der empowered the Director of Economic Stabilization, on receiving
a report from the National War Labor Board that someone was not
complying with its orders, to issue “directives” to the appropriate
department or agency requiring that privileges, benefits, rights, or
preferences enjoyed by the noncomplying party be withdrawn.140
    Sanctions were also occasionally employed by statutory agen-
cies, such as OPA, to supplement the penal provisions of the Emer-
gency Price Control Act of January 30, 1942.141 In Steuart & Bro.
v. Bowles,142 the Supreme Court had the opportunity to regularize
this type of executive emergency legislation. Here, a retail dealer
in fuel oil was charged with having violated a rationing order of
OPA by obtaining large quantities of oil from its supplier without
surrendering ration coupons, by delivering many thousands of gal-
lons of fuel oil without requiring ration coupons, and so on, and
was prohibited by the agency from receiving oil for resale or trans-
fer for the ensuing year. The offender conceded the validity of the
rationing order in support of which the suspension order was is-
sued but challenged the validity of the latter as imposing a penalty
that Congress had not enacted and asked the district court to en-
join it.
    The court refused to do so and was sustained by the Supreme
Court in its position. Justice Douglas wrote for the Court: “[W]ith-
out rationing, the fuel tanks of a few would be full; the fuel tanks
of many would be empty. Some localities would have plenty; com-
munities less favorably situated would suffer. Allocation or ration-
ing is designed to eliminate such inequalities and to treat all alike
who are similarly situated. . . . But middlemen—wholesalers and
retailers—bent on defying the rationing system could raise havoc
with it. . . . These middlemen are the chief if not the only conduits
