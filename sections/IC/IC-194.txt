persons whom it has convicted. In the 1936 trial of Judge Ritter,
the Senate determined that removal is automatic upon conviction,
and does not require a separate vote.828 This practice has contin-
ued. Because conviction requires a two-thirds vote, this means that
removal can occur only as a result of a two-thirds vote. Unlike re-
moval, disqualification from office is a discretionary judgment, and
there is no explicit constitutional linkage to the two-thirds vote on
conviction. Although an argument can be made that disqualifica-
tion should nonetheless require a two-thirds vote,829 the Senate has
determined that disqualification may be accomplished by a simple
majority vote.830

Impeachable Offenses
     The Convention came to its choice of words describing the grounds
for impeachment after much deliberation, but the phrasing derived
directly from the English practice. On June 2, 1787, the framers
adopted a provision that the executive should “be removable on im-
peachment & conviction of mal-practice or neglect of duty.” 831 The
Committee of Detail reported as grounds “Treason (or) Bribery or
Corruption.” 832 And the Committee of Eleven reduced the phrase
to “Treason, or bribery.” 833 On September 8, Mason objected to this
limitation, observing that the term did not encompass all the con-
duct that should be grounds for removal; he therefore proposed to
add “or maladministration” following “bribery.” Upon Madison’s ob-
jection that “[s]o vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure dur-
ing pleasure of the Senate,” Mason suggested “other high crimes &
misdemeanors,” which was adopted without further recorded de-
bate.834
     The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” in the context of
impeachments has an ancient English history, first turning up in

AND HISTORICAL ANALYSIS 77–79 (2d ed. 2000).
    830 The Senate imposed disqualification twice, on Judges Humphreys and Archbald.

In the Humphreys trial the Senate determined that the issues of removal and dis-
qualification are divisible, 3 HINDS’ PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES § 2397
(1907), and in the Archbald trial the Senate imposed judgment of disqualification by
vote of 39 to 35. 6 CANNON’S PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES § 512 (1936).
During the 1936 trial of Judge Ritter, a parliamentary inquiry as to whether a two-
thirds vote or a simple majority vote is required for disqualification was answered
by reference to the simple majority vote in the Archbald trial. 3 DESCHLER’S PREC-
EDENTS ch. 14, § 13.10. The Senate then rejected disqualification of Judge Ritter by
vote of 76–0. 80 CONG. REC. 5607 (1936).
