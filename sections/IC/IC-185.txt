    Rare has been the opportunity for the Court to elucidate its opin-
ion in Mississippi v. Johnson, and, in the Watergate tapes case,785
it held the President amenable to subpoena to produce evidence for
use in a criminal case without dealing, except obliquely, with its
prior opinion. The President’s counsel had argued the President was
immune to judicial process, claiming “that the independence of the
Executive Branch within its own sphere . . . insulates a President
from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution, and
thereby protects confidential Presidential communications.” 786 How-
ever, the Court held, “neither the doctrine of separation of powers,
nor the need for confidentiality of high-level communications, with-
out more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privi-
lege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.” 787
The primary constitutional duty of the courts “to do justice in crimi-
nal prosecutions” was a critical counterbalance to the claim of presi-
dential immunity, and to accept the President’s argument would dis-
turb the separation-of-powers function of achieving “a workable
government” as well as “gravely impair the role of the courts under
Art. III.” 788
    Present throughout the Watergate crisis, and unresolved by it,
was the question of the amenability of the President to criminal
prosecution prior to conviction upon impeachment.789 It was ar-

Wall.) 50 (1867). Before and since, however, the device to obtain review of the Presi-
dent’s actions has been to bring suit against the subordinate officer charged with
carrying out the President’s wishes. Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S.
(12 Pet.) 524 (1838); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935); Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Congress has not provided pro-
cess against the President. In Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992), resolv-
ing a long-running dispute, the Court held that the President is not subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act and his actions, therefore, are not reviewable in suits
under the Act. Inasmuch as some agency action, the acts of the Secretary of Com-
merce in this case, is preliminary to presidential action, the agency action is not
“final” for purposes of APA review. Constitutional claims would still be brought, how-
ever. See also, following Franklin, Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994).

     789 The Impeachment Clause, Article I, § 3, cl. 7, provides that the party con-

victed upon impeachment shall nonetheless be liable to criminal proceedings. Mor-
ris in the Convention, 2 M. FARRAND, THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787
500 (rev. ed. 1937), and Hamilton in THE FEDERALIST, Nos. 65, 69 (J. Cooke ed. 1961),
442, 463, asserted that criminal trial would follow a successful impeachment.
