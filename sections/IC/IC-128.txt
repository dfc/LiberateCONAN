members of the White House staff, or presidential appointees. He
was to remain in office until a date mutually agreed upon between
the Attorney General and himself, and the regulations provided that
the Special Prosecutor “will not be removed from his duties except
for extraordinary improprieties on his part.” 564 On October 20, fol-
lowing the resignations of the Attorney General and the Deputy At-
torney General, the Solicitor General as Acting Attorney General
formally dismissed the Special Prosecutor 565 and three days later
rescinded the regulation establishing the office.566 In subsequent liti-
gation, a federal district court held that the firing by the Acting
Attorney General had violated the regulations, which were in force
at the time and which had to be followed until they were re-
scinded.567 The Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon 568 seemed
to confirm this analysis by the district court in upholding the au-
thority of the new Special Prosecutor to take the President to court
to obtain evidence in the President’s possession. Left unsettled were
two questions, the power of the President himself to go over the
heads of his subordinates and to fire the Special Prosecutor him-
self, whatever the regulations said, and the power of Congress to
enact legislation establishing an Office of Special Prosecutor free
from direction and control of the President.569 When Congress acted
to create an office, first called the Special Prosecutor and then the
Independent Counsel, resolution of the question became necessary.
    The Removal Power Rationalized.—The tension that had long
been noticed between Myers and Humphrey’s Executor, at least in
terms of the language used in those cases but also to some extent
in their holdings, appears to have been ameliorated by two deci-
sions, which purport to reconcile the cases but, more important, pur-
port to establish, in the latter case, a mode of analysis for resolv-
ing separation-of-powers disputes respecting the removal of persons
