     Different rules prevail when such an official is sued for a “con-
stitutional tort” for wrongs allegedly in violation of our basic char-
ter,807 although the Court has hinted that in some “sensitive” areas
officials acting in the “outer perimeter” of their duties may be ac-
corded an absolute immunity from liability.808 Jurisdiction to reach
such officers for acts for which they can be held responsible must
be under the general “federal question” jurisdictional statute, which,
as recently amended, requires no jurisdictional amount.809

                       COMMISSIONING OFFICERS
    The power to commission officers, as applied in practice, does
not mean that the President is under constitutional obligation to
commission those whose appointments have reached that stage, but
merely that it is he and no one else who has the power to commis-
sion them, and that he may do so at his discretion. Under the doc-
trine of Marbury v. Madison, the sealing and delivery of the com-
mission is a purely ministerial act which has been lodged by statute
with the Secretary of State, and which may be compelled by man-
damus unless the appointee has been in the meantime validly re-


ment because the FTCA has not waived sovereign immunity. United States v. Smith,
499 U.S. 160 (1991) (Westfall Act bars suit against federal employee even when an
exception in the FTCA bars suit against the government). Cognizant of the tempta-
tion of the government to immunize both itself and its employee, the Court in Gutier-
rez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U.S. 417 (1995), held that the Attorney General’s
certification is subject to judicial review.
     807 An implied cause of action against officers accused of constitutional viola-

tions was recognized in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bu-
reau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). In Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478 (1978), a
Bivens action, the Court distinguished between common-law torts and constitu-
tional torts and denied high federal officials, including cabinet secretaries, absolute
immunity, in favor of the qualified immunity previously accorded high state officials
under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982), the Court de-
nied presidential aides derivative absolute presidential immunity, but it modified the
rules of qualified immunity, making it more difficult to hold such aides, other fed-
eral officials, and indeed state and local officials, liable for constitutional torts. In
Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), the Court extended qualified immunity to
the Attorney General for authorizing a warrantless wiretap in a case involving do-
mestic national security. Although the Court later held such warrantless wiretaps
violated the Fourth Amendment, at the time of the Attorney General’s authorization
this interpretation was not “clearly established,” and the Harlow immunity pro-
tected officials exercising discretion on such open questions. See also Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987) (in an exceedingly opaque opinion, the Court ex-
tended similar qualified immunity to FBI agents who conducted a warrantless search).

     809 See 28 U.S.C. § 1331. On deleting the jurisdictional amount, see Pub. L. 94–

574, 90 Stat. 2721 (1976), and Pub. L. 96–486, 94 Stat. 2369 (1980). If such suits
are brought in state courts, they can be removed to federal district courts. 28 U.S.C.
