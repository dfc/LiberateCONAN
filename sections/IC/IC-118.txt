Tax Court as an Article I court was a “Court of Law” within the
meaning of the Appointments Clause.520 The other four Justices con-
cluded that the Tax Court, as an independent establishment in the
executive branch, was a “department” for purposes of the Appoint-
ments Clause. In their view, in the context of text and practice, the
term meant, not Cabinet-level departments, but “all independent
executive establishments,” so that “ ‘Heads of Departments’ in-
cludes the heads of all agencies immediately below the President
in the organizational structure of the Executive Branch.” 521
     The Freytag decision must be considered a tentative rather than
a settled construction.522
     As noted, the Appointments Clause also authorizes Congress to
vest the power in “Courts of Law.” Must the power to appoint when
lodged in courts be limited to those officers acting in the judicial
branch, as the Court first suggested? 523 No, the Court said subse-
quently. In Ex parte Siebold,524 the Court sustained Congress’s de-
cision to vest in courts the appointment of federal election supervi-
sors, charged with preventing fraud and rights violations in
congressional elections in the South, and disavowed any thought
that interbranch appointments could not be authorized under the
clause. A special judicial division was authorized to appoint indepen-
dent counsels to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute charges of
corruption in the executive, and the Court, in near unanimity, sus-
tained the law, denying that interbranch appointments, in and of
themselves, and leaving aside more precise separation-of-powers claims,
were improper under the clause.525
     Congressional Regulation of Conduct in Office.—Congress
has very broad powers in regulating the conduct in office of officers
and employees of the United States, and this authority extends to
regulation of political activities. By an act passed in 1876, it prohib-
ited “all executive officers or employees of the United States not ap-
pointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Sen-
     520 501 U.S. at 888–92. This holding was vigorously controverted by the other

four Justices. Id. at 901–14 (Justice Scalia concurring).
     521 501 U.S. at 918, 919 (Justice Scalia concurring).
     522 As the text suggested, Freytag seemed to be a tentative decision, and Edmond

v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 (1997), a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia,
whose concurring opinion in Freytag challenged the Court’s analysis, may easily be
read as retreating considerably from it.
     523 In re Hennen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 230 (1839). The suggestion was that inferior

officers are intended to be subordinate to those in whom their appointment is vested.
Id. at 257–58; United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 509 (1879).
     524 100 U.S. 371 (1880).
     525 Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 673–77 (1988). See also Young v. United

States ex rel. Vuitton, 481 U.S. 787 (1987) (appointment of private attorneys to act
as prosecutors for judicial contempt judgments); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S.
868, 888–92 (1991) (appointment of special judges by Chief Judge of Tax Court).
