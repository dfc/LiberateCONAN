The Chase Impeachment
     The issue of the scope of impeachable offenses was early joined
as a consequence of the Jefferson Administration’s efforts to rid it-
self of some of the Federalist judges who were propagandizing the
country through grand jury charges and other means. The theory
of extreme latitude was enunciated by Senator Giles of Virginia dur-
ing the impeachment trial of Justice Chase. “The power of impeach-
ment was given without limitation to the House of Representa-
tives; and the power of trying impeachments was given equally without
limitation to the Senate. . . . A trial and removal of a judge upon
impeachment need not imply any criminality or corruption in him
. . . [but] nothing more than a declaration of Congress to this ef-
fect: You hold dangerous opinions, and if you are suffered to carry
them into effect you will work the destruction of the nation. We want
your offices, for the purpose of giving them to men who will fill them
better.” 845 Chase’s counsel responded that to be impeachable, con-
duct must constitute an indictable offense.846 The issue was left un-
resolved, Chase’s acquittal owing more to the political divisions in
the Senate than to the merits of the arguments.847

Other Impeachments of Judges
    The 1803 impeachment and conviction of Judge Pickering as well
as several successful 20th century impeachments of judges appear
to establish that judges may be removed for seriously questionable
conduct that does not violate a criminal statute.848 The articles on

CHASE AND PRESIDENT ANDREW JOHNSON (1992). The proceedings against Presidents Ty-
ler and Johnson and the investigation of Justice Douglas are also generally viewed
as precedents that restrict the use of impeachment as a political weapon.
     848 Some have argued that the constitutional requirement of “good behavior” and

“high crimes and misdemeanors” conjoin to allow the removal of judges who have
engaged in non-criminal conduct inconsistent with their responsibilities, or that the
standard of “good behavior”—not that of “high crimes and misdemeanors”—should
govern impeachment of judges. See 3 DESCHLER’S PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESEN-
