sional limitations than of revised judicial opinion.735 It should be
noted that in 1947 Congress authorized the President to seek in-
junctive relief in “national emergency” labor disputes, which would
seem to imply absence of authority to act in situations not meeting
the statutory definition.736
     With regard to the power of the President to seek injunctive
relief in other situations without statutory authority, there is no clear
precedent. In New York Times Co. v. United States,737 the govern-
ment sought to enjoin two newspapers from publishing classified
material given to them by a dissident former governmental em-
ployee. Though the Supreme Court rejected the Government’s claim,
five of the six majority Justices relied on First Amendment grounds,
apparently assuming basic power to bring the action in the first
place, and three dissenters were willing to uphold the constitution-
ality of the Government’s action and its basic power on the prem-
ise that the President was authorized to protect the secrecy of gov-
ernmental documents. Only one Justice denied expressly that power
was lacking altogether to sue.738

The President as Executor of the Law of Nations
    Illustrative of the President’s duty to discharge the responsibili-
ties of the United States in international law with a view to avoid-
ing difficulties with other governments was the action of President
Wilson in closing the Marconi Wireless Station at Siasconset, Mas-
sachusetts, on the outbreak of the European War in 1914, the com-
pany having refused assurance that it would comply with naval cen-
sorship regulations. Justifying this drastic invasion of private rights,
Attorney General Gregory said: “The President of the United States
     735 Thus, the Chief Justice noted that “we agree” that the debates on Norris-

LaGuardia “indicate that Congress, in passing the Act, did not intend to permit the
United States to continue to intervene by injunction in purely private labor dis-
putes.” Of course, he continued, “whether Congress so intended or not is a question
different from the one before us now.” 330 U.S. at 278.
