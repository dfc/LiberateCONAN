cally motivated harassing and frivolous litigation. Congress has the
power, the Court advised, if it should think necessary to legislate,
to afford the President protection.801

The President’s Subordinates
     While the courts may be unable to compel the President to act
or to prevent him from acting, his acts, when performed, are in proper
cases subject to judicial review and disallowance. Typically, the sub-
ordinates through whom he acts may be sued, in a form of legal
fiction, to enjoin the commission of acts which might lead to irrepa-
rable damage 802 or to compel by writ of mandamus the perfor-
mance of a duty definitely required by law.803 Such suits are usu-
ally brought in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia.804 In suits under the common law, a subordinate execu-
tive officer may be held personally liable in damages for any act
done in excess of authority,805 although immunity exists for any-
thing, even malicious wrongdoing, done in the course of his du-
ties.806

     801 The Court observed at one point that it doubted that defending the suit would

much preoccupy the President, that his time and energy would not be much taken
up by it. “If the past is any indicator, it seems unlikely that a deluge of such litiga-
tion will ever engulf the Presidency.” 520 U.S. at 702.
     802 E.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) (suit to

enjoin Secretary of Commerce to return steel mills seized on President’s order); Dames
& Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981) (suit against Secretary of Treasury to nullify
presidential orders on Iranian assets). See also Noble v. Union River Logging Rail-
road, 147 U.S. 165 (1893); Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605 (1912).
     803 E.g., Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137 (1803) (suit against Secretary of

State to compel delivery of commissions of office); Kendall v. United States ex rel.
Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524 (1838) (suit against Postmaster General to compel pay-
ment of money owed under act of Congress); Decatur v. Paulding, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.)
497 (1840) (suit to compel Secretary of Navy to pay a pension).
     804 This was originally on the theory that the Supreme Court of the District of

Columbia had inherited, via the common law of Maryland, the jurisdiction of the
King’s Bench “over inferior jurisdictions and officers.” Kendall v. United States ex
rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524, 614, 620–21 (1838). Congress has now authorized
federal district courts outside the District of Columbia also to entertain such suits.

     805 E.g., Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cr.) 170 (1804); Bates v. Clark, 95 U.S. 204

v. Greenhow), 114 U.S. 269 (1885); Belknap v. Schild, 161 U.S. 10 (1896).

See Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.S. 292 (1988) (action must be discretionary in nature
as well as being within the scope of employment, before federal official is entitled to
absolute immunity). Following the Westfall decision, Congress enacted the Federal
Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (the Westfall Act),
which authorized the Attorney General to certify that an employee was acting within
the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which a suit
arose; upon certification, the employee is dismissed from the action, and the United
States is substituted, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) then governing the ac-
tion, which means that sometimes the action must be dismissed against the govern-
