Court has numerous times so stated.358 It does not appear that the
Court has ever held a treaty unconstitutional,359 although there are
cases in which the decision seemed to be compelled by constitu-
tional considerations.360 In fact, there would be little argument with
regard to the general point were it not for dicta in Justice Holmes’
opinion in Missouri v. Holland.361 “Acts of Congress,” he said, “are
the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the
Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under
the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether
the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts
prescribed to make the convention.” Although he immediately fol-
lowed this passage with a cautionary “[w]e do not mean to imply
that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power . . . ,” 362
the Justice’s language and the holding by which it appeared that
the reserved rights of the states could be invaded through the treaty
power led in the 1950s to an abortive effort to amend the Constitu-
tion to restrict the treaty power.363


     358 “The treaty is . . . a law made by the proper authority, and the courts of

justice have no right to annul or disregard any of its provisions, unless they violate
the Constitution of the United States.” Doe v. Braden, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 635, 656
(1853). “It need hardly be said that a treaty cannot change the Constitution or be
held valid if it be in violation of that instrument.” The Cherokee Tobacco, 78 U.S.
(11 Wall.), 616, 620 (1871). See also Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258, 267 (1890); United
States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 700 (1898); Asakura v. City of Seattle, 265
U.S. 332, 341 (1924).
     359 1 W. Willoughby, supra, at 561; L. Henkin, supra, at 137. In Power Author-

ity of New York v. FPC, 247 F.2d 538 (2d Cir. 1957), a reservation attached by the
Senate to a 1950 treaty with Canada was held invalid. The court observed that the
reservation was properly not a part of the treaty but that if it were it would still be
void as an attempt to circumvent constitutional procedures for enacting amend-
ments to existing federal laws. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment on moot-
ness grounds. 355 U.S. 64 (1957). In United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d
655 (4th Cir. 1953), an executive agreement with Canada was held void as conflict-
ing with existing legislation. The Supreme Court affirmed on nonconstitutional grounds.

     360 Cf. City of New Orleans v. United States, 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 662 (1836); Rocca

v. Thompson, 223 U.S. 317 (1912).

     362 252 U.S. at 433. Subsequently, he also observed: “The treaty in question does

not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution.” Id.
     363 The attempt, the so-called “Bricker Amendment,” was aimed at the expan-

sion into reserved state powers through treaties as well as executive agreements.
The key provision read: “A treaty shall become effective as internal law in the United
States only through legislation which would be valid in the absence of treaty.” S.J.
Res. 43, 82d Congress, 1st Sess. (1953), § 2. See also S.J. Res. 1, 84th Congress, 1st
Sess. (1955), § 2. Extensive hearings developed the issues thoroughly but not al-
ways clearly. Hearings on S.J. Res. 130: Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee, 82d Congress, 2d Sess. (1952). Hearings on S.J. Res. 1 & 43: Be-
fore a Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 83d Congress, 1st Sess. (1953).
