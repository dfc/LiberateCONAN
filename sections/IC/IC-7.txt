ultimately rejected the proposal and adopted language vesting in
the Senate the power to “advise and consent” with regard to these
matters.8
    Finally, the designation of the executive as the “President of the
United States” was made in a tentative draft reported by the Com-
mittee on Detail 9 and accepted by the Convention without discus-
sion.10 The same clause had provided that the President’s title was
to be “His Excellency,” 11 and, while this language was also ac-
cepted without discussion,12 it was subsequently omitted by the Com-
mittee on Style and Arrangement 13 with no statement of the rea-
son and no comment in the Convention.

Executive Power: Theory of the Presidential Office
    The most obvious meaning of the language of Article II, § 1, is
to confirm that the executive power is vested in a single person,
but almost from the beginning it has been contended that the words
mean much more than this simple designation of locus. Indeed, con-
tention with regard to this language reflects the much larger de-
bate about the nature of the Presidency. With Justice Jackson, we
“may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous
authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power as they
actually present themselves. Just what our forefathers did envi-
sion, or would have envisioned had they foreseen modern condi-
tions, must be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the
dreams Joseph was called upon to interpret for Pharaoh. A century
and a half of partisan debate and scholarly speculation yields no
net result but only supplies more or less apt quotations from re-
spected sources on each side of any question. They largely cancel
each other.” 14 At the least, it is no doubt true that the “loose and
general expressions” by which the powers and duties of the execu-
tive branch are denominated 15 place the President in a position in
which he, as Professor Woodrow Wilson noted, “has the right, in
law and conscience, to be as big a man as he can” and in which
“only his capacity will set the limit.” 16
