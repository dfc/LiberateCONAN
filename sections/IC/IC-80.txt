tion.346 Congress could not confer judicial power upon American con-
suls abroad to be exercised over American citizens abroad, but the
treaty-power can and has, and Congress has passed legislation per-
fecting such agreements, and the Supreme Court has upheld such
legislation.347
    Again, Congress of itself could not provide for the extradition
of fugitives from justice, but the treaty-power can and has done so
scores of times, and Congress has passed legislation carrying our
extradition treaties into effect.348 And Congress could not ordinar-
ily penalize private acts of violence within a state, but it can pun-
ish such acts if they deprive aliens of their rights under a treaty.349
Referring to such legislation, the Court has said: “The power of Con-
gress to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execu-
tion as well the powers enumerated in section 8 of Article I of the
Constitution, as all others vested in the Government of the United
States, or in any Department or the officers thereof, includes the
power to enact such legislation as is appropriate to give efficacy to
any stipulations which it is competent for the President by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate to insert in a treaty with for-
eign power.” 350 In a word, the treaty-power cannot purport to amend
the Constitution by adding to the list of Congress’s enumerated pow-
ers, but having acted, the consequence will often be that it has pro-
vided Congress with an opportunity to enact measures that inde-
pendently of a treaty Congress could not enact; the only question
that can be raised as to such measures is whether they are “neces-
sary and proper” for the carrying of the treaty in question into op-
eration.

    347  See In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453 (1891), where the treaty provisions involved are
given. The supplementary legislation, later reenacted at Rev. Stat. 4083–4091, was
repealed by the Joint Res. of August 1, 1956, 70 Stat. 774. The validity of the Ross
case was subsequently questioned. See Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 12, 64, 75 (1957).

     350 Neely v. Henkel, 180 U.S. 109, 121 (1901). A different theory is offered by

Justice Story in his opinion for the court in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.)
539 (1842): “Treaties made between the United States and foreign powers, often con-
tain special provisions, which do not execute themselves, but require the interposi-
tion of Congress to carry them into effect, and Congress has constantly, in such cases,
legislated on the subject; yet, although the power is given to the executive, with the
consent of the senate, to make treaties, the power is nowhere in positive terms con-
ferred upon Congress to make laws to carry the stipulations of treaties into effect.
It has been supposed to result from the duty of the national government to fulfill all
the obligations of treaties.” Id. at 619. Story was here in quest of arguments to prove
that Congress had power to enact a fugitive slave law, which he based on its power
“to carry into effect rights expressly given and duties expressly enjoined” by the Con-
stitution. Id. at 618–19. However, the treaty-making power is neither a right nor a
duty, but one of the powers “vested by this Constitution in the Government of the
United States.” Art. I, § 8, cl. 18.
