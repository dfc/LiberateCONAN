v. Cloyd W. Miller Co.,152 the Court held constitutional the new rent
control law on the ground that cessation of hostilities did not end
the government’s war power, but that the power continued to rem-
edy the evil arising out of the emergency. Yet, Justice Douglas noted
for the Court, “We recognize the force of the argument that the ef-
fects of war under modern conditions may be felt in the economy
for years and years, and that if the war power can be used in days
of peace to treat all the wounds which war inflicts on our society, it
may not only swallow up all other powers of Congress but largely
obliterate the Ninth and Tenth Amendments as well. There are no
such implications in today’s decision.” 153 Justice Jackson, though
concurring, noted that he found the war power “the most danger-
ous one to free government in the whole catalogue of powers” and
cautioned that its exercise “be scrutinized with care.” 154 And, in
Ludecke v. Watkins,155 four dissenting Justices were prepared to hold
that the presumption in the statute under review of continued war
with Germany was “a pure fiction” and not to be used.
    But the postwar period was a time of reaction against the war-
time exercise of power by President Roosevelt, and President Tru-
man was not permitted the same liberties. The Twenty-second Amend-
ment, writing into permanent law the two-term custom, the “Great
Debate” about our participation in NATO, the attempt to limit the
treaty-making power, and other actions, bespoke the reaction.156 The
Supreme Court signalized this reaction when it struck down the
President’s action in seizing the steel industry while it was struck
during the Korean War.157
     Nonetheless, the long period of the Cold War and of active hos-
tilities in Korea and Indochina, in addition to the issue of the use
of troops in the absence of congressional authorization, further cre-
ated conditions for consolidation of powers in the President. In par-
ticular, a string of declarations of national emergencies, most, in
whole or part, under the Trading with the Enemy Act,158 under-
girded the exercise of much presidential power. In the storm of re-
sponse to the Vietnamese conflict, here, too, Congress reasserted leg-
islative power to curtail what it viewed as excessive executive power,
repealing the Trading with the Enemy Act and enacting in its place
