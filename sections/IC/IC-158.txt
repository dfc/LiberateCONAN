frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or in-
volve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the
executive or legislature; but many such questions uniquely de-
mand single-voiced statement of the Government’s views. Yet it is
error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches for-
eign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field
seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular
question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the
political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the
light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the pos-
sible consequences of judicial action.” 672 However, the Court came
within one vote of creating a broad application of the political ques-
tion doctrine in foreign relations disputes, at least in the context of
a dispute between Congress and the President with respect to a proper
allocation of constitutional powers.673 In any event, the Court, in
adjudicating on the merits disputes in which the foreign relations
powers are called into question, follows a policy of such deference
to executive and congressional expertise that the result may not be
dissimilar to a broad application of the political question doc-
trine.674

                THE PRESIDENT AS LAW ENFORCER

Powers Derived From The “Take Care” Duty
    The Constitution does not say that the President shall execute
the laws, but that “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed,” i.e., by others, who are commonly, but not always with
      672 369 U.S. at 211–12. A case involving “a purely legal question of statutory

interpretation” is not a political question simply because the issues have significant
political and foreign relations overtones. Japan Whaling Ass’n v. American Cetacean
Society, 478 U.S. 221, 229–30 (1986) (Fisherman’s Protective Act does not com-
pletely remove Secretary of Commerce’s discretion in certifying that foreign nation-
als are “diminishing the effectiveness of ” an international agreement by taking whales
in violation of quotas set pursuant to the agreement).
      673 Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996, 1002–06 (Justices Rehnquist, Stewart, and

Stevens and Chief Justice Burger). The doctrine was applied in just such a dispute
in Dole v. Carter, 569 F.2d 1109 (10th Cir. 1977).
      674 “Matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely

proper subjects for judicial intervention.” Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 (1981).
See also Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 688 (1981); Rostker v. Goldberg,
453 U.S. 57, 64–68 (1981); Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 837–838 (1976); Parker v.
Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 756, 758 (1974); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 589
(1952). Neither may private claimants seek judicial review of executive actions de-
nying constitutional rights “in such sensitive areas as national security and foreign
policy” in suits for damages against offending officials, inasmuch as the President is
absolutely immune, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), and the Court has strongly
hinted that in these areas the immunity of presidential aides and other executive
officials “entrusted with discretionary authority” will be held to be absolute rather
than qualified. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 812–13 (1982).
