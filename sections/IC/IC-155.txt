relations, shall, in its correspondence with a foreign nation, as-
sume a fact in regard to the sovereignty of any island or country, it
is conclusive on the judicial department? And in this view, it is not
material to inquire, nor is it the province of the court to determine,
whether the executive be right or wrong. It is enough to know, that
in the exercise of his constitutional functions, he had decided the
question. Having done this, under the responsibilities which belong
to him, it is obligatory on the people and government of the Union.”
     “If this were not the rule, cases might often arise, in which, on
most important questions of foreign jurisdiction, there would be an
irreconcilable difference between the executive and judicial depart-
ments. By one of these departments, a foreign island or country might
be considered as at peace with the United States; whilst the other
would consider it in a state of war. No well-regulated government
has ever sanctioned a principle so unwise, and so destructive of na-
tional character.” 657 Thus, the right to determine the boundaries of
the country is a political function,658 as is also the right to deter-
mine what country is sovereign of a particular region,659 to deter-
mine whether a community is entitled under international law to
be considered a belligerent or an independent state,660 to deter-
mine whether the other party has duly ratified a treaty,661 to deter-
mine who is the de jure or de facto ruler of a country,662 to deter-
mine whether a particular person is a duly accredited diplomatic
agent to the United States,663 to determine how long a military oc-
cupation shall continue in fulfillment of the terms of a treaty,664 to
determine whether a treaty is in effect or not, although doubtless
an extinguished treaty could be constitutionally renewed by tacit
consent.665
     Recent Statements of the Doctrine.—The assumption under-
lying the refusal of courts to intervene in cases involving conduct
of foreign relations is well stated in Chicago & S. Air Lines v. Wa-
terman S.S. Corp.666 Here, the Court refused to review orders of
the Civil Aeronautics Board granting or denying applications by citi-
zen carriers to engage in overseas and foreign air transportation,
which by the terms of the Civil Aeronautics Act were subject to ap-
