never been established by law, no vacancy existed to which the Presi-
dent could constitutionally make a recess appointment. To this ar-
gument, it was answered that the Constitution recognizes “two de-
scriptions of offices altogether different in their nature, authorized
by the constitution—one to be created by law, and the other depend-
ing for their existence and continuance upon contingencies. Of the
first kind, are judicial, revenue, and similar offices. Of the second,
are Ambassadors, other public Ministers, and Consuls. The first de-
scriptions organize the government and give it efficacy. They form
the internal system, and are susceptible of precise enumeration. When
and how they are created, and when and how they become vacant,
may always be ascertained with perfect precision. Not so with the
second description. They depend for their original existence upon
the law, but are the offspring of the state of our relations with for-
eign nations, and must necessarily be governed by distinct rules.
As an independent power, the United States have relations with
all other independent powers; and the management of those rela-
tions is vested in the Executive.” 496
     By the opening section of the act of March 1, 1855, it was pro-
vided that “from and after the thirtieth day of June next, the Presi-
dent of the United States shall, by and with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, appoint representatives of the grade of envoys
extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary,” with a specified an-
nual compensation for each, “to the following countries. . . .” In the
body of the act was also this provision: “The President shall ap-
point no other than citizens of the United States, who are resi-
dents thereof, or who shall be abroad in the employment of the gov-
ernment at the time of their appointment. . . .” 497 The question of
the interpretation of the act having been referred to Attorney Gen-
eral Cushing, he ruled that its total effect, aside from its salary
provisions, was recommendatory only. It was “to say, that if, and
whenever, the President shall, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, appoint an envoy extraordinary and minister pleni-
potentiary to Great Britain, or to Sweden, the compensation of that
minister shall be so much and no more.” 498
     This line of reasoning is only partially descriptive of the facts.

of the foreign service, diplomatic as well as consular, contains de-
tailed provisions as to grades, salaries, promotions, and, in part, as
