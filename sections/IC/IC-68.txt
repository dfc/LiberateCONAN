invade it,” declared Justice Sutherland for the Court in 1936.282 The
Senate must, moreover, content itself with such information as the
President chooses to furnish it.283 In performing the function that
remains to it, however, it has several options. It may consent uncon-
ditionally to a proposed treaty, it may refuse its consent, or it may
stipulate conditions in the form of amendments to the treaty, of res-
ervations to the act of ratification, or of statements of understand-
ing or other declarations, the formal difference between the first two
and the third being that amendments and reservations, if accepted
by the President must be communicated to the other parties to the
treaty, and, at least with respect to amendments and often reserva-
tions as well, require reopening negotiations and changes, whereas
the other actions may have more problematic results.284 The act of
ratification for the United States is the President’s act, but it may
not be forthcoming unless the Senate has consented to it by the
required two-thirds of the Senators present, which signifies two-
thirds of a quorum, otherwise the consent rendered would not be
that of the Senate as organized under the Constitution to do busi-
ness.285 Conversely, the President may, if dissatisfied with amend-
ments which have been affixed by the Senate to a proposed treaty
or with the conditions stipulated by it to ratification, decide to aban-
don the negotiation, which he is entirely free to do.286
Treaties as Law of the Land
    Treaty commitments of the United States are of two kinds. As
Chief Justice Marshall wrote in 1829: “A treaty is, in its nature, a
contract between two nations, not a legislative act. It does not gen-
erally effect, of itself, the object to be accomplished; especially, so
far as its operation is infra-territorial; but is carried into execution
by the sovereign power of the respective parties to the instrument.
In the United States, a different principle is established. Our con-
stitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, conse-
quently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act
of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself, without the aid of
