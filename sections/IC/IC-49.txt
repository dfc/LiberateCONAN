to a great extent the ensuing peace.191 He may not, however, effect
a permanent acquisition of territory,192 though he may govern re-
cently acquired territory until Congress sets up a more permanent
regime.193
     The President is the ultimate tribunal for the enforcement of
the rules and regulations that Congress adopts for the government
of the forces, and that are enforced through courts-martial.194 In-
deed, until 1830, courts-martial were convened solely on the Presi-
dent’s authority as Commander in Chief.195 Such rules and regula-
tions are, moreover, it seems, subject in wartime to his amendment
at discretion.196 Similarly, the power of Congress to “make rules for
the government and regulation of the land and naval forces” (Art.
I, § 8, cl. 14) did not prevent President Lincoln from promulgating,
in April, 1863, a code of rules to govern the conduct in the field of
the armies of the United States, which was prepared at his in-
stance by a commission headed by Francis Lieber and which later
became the basis of all similar codifications both here and abroad.197
One important power that the President lacks is that of choosing
his subordinates, whose grades and qualifications are determined
by Congress and whose appointment is ordinarily made by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, though undoubtedly Con-
gress could if it wished vest their appointment in “the President
alone.” 198 Also, the President’s power to dismiss an officer from the
service, once unlimited, is today confined by statute in time of peace
to dismissal “in pursuance of the sentence of a general court-
martial or in mitigation thereof.” 199 But the provision is not re-
garded by the Court as preventing the President from displacing
an officer of the Army or Navy by appointing with the advice and
