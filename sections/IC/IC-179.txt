edent, both judicial and presidential and congressional practice. One
of the earliest pronouncements on presidential power in this area
was that of Chief Justice Marshall in Little v. Barreme.759 There, a
United States vessel under orders from the President had seized a
United States merchant ship bound from a French port allegedly
carrying contraband material; Congress had, however, provided for
seizure only of such vessels bound to French ports.760 The Chief Jus-
tice wrote: “It is by no means clear, that the President of the United
States, whose high duty it is to ‘take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed,’ and who is commander-in-chief of the armies and
navies of the United States, might not, without any special author-
ity for that purpose, in the then existing state of things, have em-
powered the officers commanding the armed vessels of the United
States, to seize and send into port for adjudication, American ves-
sels which were forfeited, by being engaged in this illicit com-
merce. But when it is observed, that [an act of Congress] . . . gives
a special authority to seize on the high seas, and limits that author-
ity to the seizure of vessels bound, or sailing to, a French port, the
legislature seems to have prescribed that the manner in which this
law shall be carried into execution, was to exclude a seizure of any
vessel not bound to a French port.” 761
     Other examples are at hand. In 1799, President Adams, in or-
der to execute the extradition provisions of the Jay Treaty, issued a
warrant for the arrest of one Robbins, and the action was chal-
lenged in Congress on the ground that no statutory authority ex-
isted by which the President could act; John Marshall defended the
action in the House of Representatives, the practice continued, and
it was not until 1848 that Congress enacted a statute governing
this subject.762 Again, in 1793, President Washington issued a neu-
trality proclamation; the following year, Congress enacted the first
neutrality statute and since then proclamations of neutrality have
been based on acts of Congress.763 Repeatedly, acts of the President
have been in areas in which Congress could act as well.764
     Justice Frankfurter’s concurring opinion 765 listed 18 statutory
authorizations for seizures of industrial property, all but one of which
    759 6 U.S. (2 Cr.) 170 (1804).
    760 1 Stat. 613 (1799).
    761 Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cr.) 170, 177–78 (1804).
    762 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 596, 613–14 (1800). The argument was endorsed in Fong

Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 714 (1893). The presence of a treaty, of
which this provision was self-executing, is sufficient to distinguish this example from
the steel seizure situation.
