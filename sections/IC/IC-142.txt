     Two fundamental textual issues adhere to any consideration of
the Recess Appointments Clause. The first is what constitutes a va-
cancy “that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.” If the
word “happen” is interpreted to refer only to vacancies that occur
during a recess, then the President would lack authority to make a
recess appointment to a vacancy that existed prior to the recess. If,
however, “happen” is construed more broadly to encompass all va-
cancies that exist during a recess, then the President would be em-
powered to make a recess appointment to any vacant position, irre-
spective of whether the position became vacant prior to or during a
recess. Although this issue was a source of controversy in the late
18th and early 19th centuries, a long line of Attorney General opin-
ions and judicial decisions have adopted the broader interpretation
of the clause. Attorney General William Wirt, serving under Presi-
dent Monroe, concluded that the phrase encompassed all vacancies
that happen to exist during a recess, declaring that “[t]his seems
to me the only construction of the Constitution which is compatible
with its spirit, reason, and purpose.” 614 This interpretation was first
adopted by a federal court in 1880 in In re Farrow,615 and has been
followed in judicial opinions on the issue ever since.616
     The second fundamental textual issue that adheres to any con-
sideration of the Recess Appointments Clause is the meaning of the
phrase “the Recess of the Senate.” An opinion issued by Attorney
General Knox in 1901 concluded that the phrase applied only to
adjournments between sessions of Congress (commonly referred to
as “intersession” recesses). In reaching this determination, Knox placed
      614 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 631, 633–34 (1823). Subsequent Attorney General opinions

that concurred include 2:525 (1832), 3:673 (1841), 4:523 (1846), 10:356 (1862), 11:179
(1865), 12:32 (1866), 12:455 (1868), 14:563 (1875), 15:207 (1877), 16:523 (1880), 18:28
(1884), 19:261 (1889), 26:234 (1907), 30:314 (1914), and 33:20 (1921). In 4 Ops. Atty.
Gen. 361, 363 (1845), the general doctrine was held not to apply to a yet unfilled
office that was created during the previous session of Congress, but this distinction
was rejected in the following Attorney General opinions: 12:455 (1868), 18:28 (1884),
and 19:261 (1889). For the early practice with reference to recess appointments, see

      615 3 Fed. 112 (C.C.N.D. Ga 1880).
      616 Subsequent cases concurring in this interpretation include United States v.

Allocco, 305 F.2d 704, 712 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 964 (1963) (a con-
trary interpretation “would create executive paralysis and do violence to the orderly
functioning of our complex government”); United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008,
1012 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1048 (1986) (a contrary inter-
pretation would “lead to the absurd result that all offices vacant on the day the Sen-
ate recesses would have to remain vacant at least until the Senate reconvenes”);
Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220, 1226–27 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S.
942 (2005) (“interpreting the phrase to prohibit the President from filling a vacancy
that comes into being on the last day of a Session but to empower the President to
fill a vacancy that arises immediately thereafter (on the first day of a recess) contra-
dicts what we understand to be the purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause: to
keep important offices filled and the government functioning”).
