treaties were concluded. Between 1939 and 1993, executive agree-
ments comprised more than 90% of the international agreements
concluded.418
     One must, of course, interpret the raw figures carefully. Only a
very small minority of all the executive agreements entered into
were based solely on the powers of the President as Commander in
Chief and organ of foreign relations; the remainder were autho-
rized in advance by Congress by statute or by treaty provisions rati-
fied by the Senate.419 Thus, consideration of the constitutional sig-
nificance of executive agreements must begin with a differentiation
among the kinds of agreements which are classed under this single
heading.420

Executive Agreements by Authorization of Congress
     Congress early authorized officers of the executive branch to en-
ter into negotiations and to conclude agreements with foreign gov-
ernments, authorizing the borrowing of money from foreign coun-
tries 421 and appropriating money to pay off the government of Algiers
to prevent pirate attacks on United States shipping.422 Perhaps the
first formal authorization in advance of an executive agreement was
enactment of a statute that permitted the Postmaster General to
“make arrangements with the Postmasters in any foreign country
for the reciprocal receipt and delivery of letters and packets, through
     418 CRS Study, xxxiv-xxxv, supra, 13–16. Not all such agreements, of course, are

published, either because of national-security/secrecy considerations or because the
subject matter is trivial. In a 1953 hearing exchange, Secretary of State Dulles esti-
mated that about 10,000 executive agreements had been entered into in connection
with the NATO treaty. “Every time we open a new privy, we have to have an execu-
tive agreement.” Hearing on S.J. Res. 1 and S.J. Res. 43: Before a Subcommittee of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, 83d Congress, 1st Sess. (1953), 877.
     419 One authority concluded that of the executive agreements entered into be-

tween 1938 and 1957, only 5.9 percent were based exclusively on the President’s
constitutional authority. McLaughlin, The Scope of the Treaty Power in the United
States—II, 43 MINN. L. REV. 651, 721 (1959). Another, somewhat overlapping study
found that in the period 1946–1972, 88.3% of executive agreements were based at
least in part on statutory authority; 6.2% were based on treaties, and 5.5% were
based solely on executive authority. International Agreements: An Analysis of Execu-
tive Regulations and Practices, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 95th Cong.,
1st Sess. (Comm. Print) (1977), 22 (prepared by CRS).
     420 “[T]he distinction between so-called ‘executive agreements’ and ‘treaties’ is

purely a constitutional one and has no international significance.” Harvard Re-
search in International Law, Draft Convention on the Law of Treaties, 29 AMER. J.
INT. L. 697 (Supp.) (1935). See E. Byrd, supra at 148–151. Many scholars have ag-
gressively promoted the use of executive agreements, in contrast to treaties, as a
means of enhancing the role of the United States, especially the role of the Presi-
dent, in the international system. See McDougal & Lans, Treaties and Congressional-
Executive or Presidential Agreements: Interchangeable Instruments of National Policy
(Pts. I & II), 54 YALE L. J. 181, 534 (1945).
