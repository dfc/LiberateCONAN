proval by the President and therefore impliedly beyond those provi-
sions of the act authorizing judicial review of board orders. Elabo-
rating on the necessity of judicial abstinence in the conduct of foreign
relations, Justice Jackson declared for the Court: “The President,
both as Commander in Chief and as the Nation’s organ for foreign
affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports are not and
ought not be published to the world. It would be intolerable that
courts, without the relevant information, should review and per-
haps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly
held secret. Nor can courts sit in camera in order to be taken into
executive confidences. But even if courts could require full disclo-
sure, the very nature of executive decisions as to foreign policy is
political, not judicial. Such decisions are wholly confided by our Con-
stitution on the political departments of the government, Executive
and Legislative. They are delicate, complex, and involve large ele-
ments of prophecy. They are and should be undertaken only by those
directly responsible to the people whose welfare they advance or
imperil. They are decisions of a kind for which the Judiciary has
neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and which has long been
held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judi-
cial intrusion or inquiry.” 667
    To the same effect are the Court’s holding and opinion in Ludecke
v. Watkins,668 where the question at issue was the power of the Presi-
dent to order the deportation under the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 of
     667 333 U.S. at 111. See also Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297 (1918);

Ricaud v. American Metal Co., 246 U.S. 304 (1918). Analogous to and arising out of
the same considerations as the political question doctrine is the “act of state” doc-
trine under which United States courts will not examine the validity of the public
acts of foreign governments done within their own territory, typically, but not al-
ways, in disputes arising out of nationalizations. E.g., Underhill v. Hernandez, 168
U.S. 250 (1897); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964); First
National City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba, 406 U.S. 759 (1972); Alfred Dunhill
of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. 682 (1976). For succinct analysis of
this amorphous doctrine, see Restatement, Foreign Relations, §§ 443–44. Congress
has limited the reach of the doctrine in foreign expropriation cases by the Hickenlooper
Amendments. 22 U.S.C. § 2370(e)(2). Consider, also, Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U.S. 654 (1981). Similar, also, is the doctrine of sovereign immunity of foreign states
in United States courts, under which jurisdiction over the foreign state, at least af-
ter 1952, turned upon the suggestion of the Department of State as to the applica-
bility of the doctrine. See Alfred Dunhill of London v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. at
698–706 (plurality opinion), but see id. at 725–28 (Justice Marshall dissenting). For
the period prior to 1952, see Z. & F. Assets Corp. v. Hull, 311 U.S. 470, 487 (1941).
Congress in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94–583, 90 Stat.
2891, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332(a)(2)(3)(4), 1391(f), 1441(d), 1602–1611, provided for
judicial determination of applicability of the doctrine but did adopt the executive
position with respect to no applicability for commercial actions of a foreign state.
E.g., Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480 (1983); Argentine Re-
public v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428 (1989). See Restatement, For-
eign Relations, §§ 451–63 (including Introductory Note, pp. 390–396).
     668 335 U.S. 160 (1948).
