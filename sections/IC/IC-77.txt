redress, which may in the end be enforced by actual war. It is obvi-
ous that with all this the judicial courts have nothing to do and
can give no redress.” 331
    Treaties Versus Prior Acts of Congress.—The Court has en-
forced numerous statutory provisions that it recognized as supersed-
ing prior treaty engagements. Chief Justice Marshall asserted that
the converse would be true as well 332—that a treaty that is self-
executing is the law of the land and prevails over an earlier incon-
sistent statute—and this proposition has been repeated many times
in dicta.333 But there is dispute whether in fact a treaty has ever
been held to have repealed or superseded an inconsistent statute.
Willoughby, for example, writes: “In fact, however, there have been
few (the writer is not certain that there has been any) instances in
which a treaty inconsistent with a prior act of Congress has been
given full force and effect as law in this country without the assent
of Congress. There may indeed have been cases in which, by treaty,
certain action has been taken without reference to existing Federal
laws, as, for example, where by treaty certain populations have been
collectively naturalized, but such treaty action has not operated to
repeal or annul the existing law upon the subject.” 334
    The one instance that may be an exception 335 is Cook v. United
States,336 in which a divided Court held that a 1924 treaty with
     331 Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 598 (1884). The repealability of treaties by

act of Congress was first asserted in an opinion of the Attorney General in 1854. 6
Ops. Atty. Gen. 291. The year following the doctrine was adopted judicially in a lengthy
and cogently argued opinion of Justice Curtis, speaking for a United States circuit
court in Taylor v. Morton, 23 Fed. Cas. 784 (No. 13,799) (C.C.D. Mass 1855). See

Three Gallons of Whiskey, 108 U.S. 491, 496 (1883); Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U.S.
238 (1889); The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U.S. 581, 600 (1889); Whitney v. Rob-
ertson, 124 U.S. 190, 194 (1888); Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 721
(1893). “Congress by legislation, and so far as the people and authorities of the United
States are concerned, could abrogate a treaty made between this country and an-
other country which had been negotiated by the President and approved by the Sen-
ate.” La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 423, 460 (1899). Cf. Reichart
v. Felps, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 160, 165–66 (1868), which states in dictum that “Con-
gress is bound to regard the public treaties, and it had no power . . . to nullify [In-
dian] titles confirmed many years before by the authorized agents of the govern-
ment.”
     332 Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314–15 (1829). In a later case, it was

determined in a different situation that by its terms the treaty in issue, which had
been assumed to be executory in the earlier case, was self-executing. United States
v. Percheman, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 51 (1833).

kee Tobacco, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 616, 621 (1871); Johnson v. Browne, 205 U.S. 309,

     335 Other cases, which are cited in some sources, appear distinguishable. United

States v. Schooner Peggy, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 103 (1801), applied a treaty entered into
subsequent to enactment of a statute abrogating all treaties then in effect between
