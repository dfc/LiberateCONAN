derlying legal circumstances.390 Apparently, President Lincoln was
the first to give notice of termination in the absence of prior con-
gressional authorization or direction, and Congress shortly thereaf-
ter by joint resolution ratified his action.391 The first such action by
the President, with no such subsequent congressional action, ap-
pears to be that of President McKinley in 1899, in terminating an
1850 treaty with Switzerland, but the action may be explainable as
the treaty being inconsistent with a subsequently enacted law.392
Other such renunciations by the President acting on his own have
been similarly explained and similarly the explanations have been
controverted. Although the Department of State, in setting forth le-
gal justification for President Carter’s notice of termination of the
treaty with Taiwan, cited many examples of a President’s acting alone,
many of these are ambiguous and may be explained away by, for
example, conflicts with later statutes, changed circumstances, or the
like.393
     No such ambiguity accompanied President Carter’s action on the
Taiwan treaty,394 and a somewhat lengthy Senate debate was pro-
voked. In the end, the Senate on a preliminary vote approved a “sense
of the Senate” resolution claiming for itself a consenting role in the
termination of treaties, but no final vote was ever taken and the
Senate thus did not place itself in conflict with the President.395
However, several Members of Congress went to court to contest the
termination, apparently the first time a judicial resolution of the
question had been sought. A divided Court of Appeals, on the mer-
its, held that presidential action was sufficient by itself to termi-

Foreign Relations, 96th Congress, 1st Sess. (1979), 156–191 (memorandum of Hon.
Herbert Hansell, Legal Advisor, Department of State), with Taiwan: Hearings Be-
fore the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 96th Congress, 1st Sess. (1979), 300–
307 (memorandum of Senator Goldwater). See CRS Study, supra at 164–66.

     392 The treaty, see 11 C. BEVANS, TREATIES AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OF

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 894 (1970), was probably at odds with the Tariff Act of
1897. 30 Stat. 151.
     393 Compare the views expressed in the Hansell and Goldwater memoranda, su-

pra. For expressions of views preceding the immediate controversy, see, e.g., Riesenfeld,
The Power of Congress and the President in International Relations, 25 CALIF. L. REV.

by the United States, 42 MINN. L. REV. 879 (1958).
     394 Note that the President terminated the treaty in the face of an expression of

the sense of Congress that prior consultation between President and Congress should
occur. 92 Stat. 730, 746 (1978).
     395 Originally, S. Res. 15 had disapproved presidential action alone, but it was

amended and reported by the Foreign Relations Committee to recognize at least 14
bases of presidential termination. S. REP. NO. 119, 96th Congress, 1st Sess. (1979).
In turn, this resolution was amended to state the described sense of the Senate view,
but the matter was never brought to final action. See 125 CONG. REC. 13672, 13696,
13711, 15209, 15859 (1979).
