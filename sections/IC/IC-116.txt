     In Edmond v. United States,512 the Court reviewed its pronounce-
ments regarding the definition of “inferior officer” and, disregard-
ing some implications of its prior decisions, seemingly settled, unani-
mously, on a pragmatic characterization. Thus, the importance of
the responsibilities assigned an officer, the fact that duties were lim-
ited, that jurisdiction was narrow, and that tenure was limited, are
only factors but are not definitive.513 “Generally speaking, the term
‘inferior officer’ connotes a relationship with some higher ranking
officer or officers below the President: Whether one is an ‘inferior’
officer depends on whether he has a superior. It is not enough that
other officers may be identified who formally maintain a higher rank,
or possess responsibilities of a greater magnitude. If that were the
intention, the Constitution might have used the phrase ‘lesser offi-
cer.’ Rather, in the context of a Clause designed to preserve politi-
cal accountability relative to important Government assignments,
we think it evident that ‘inferior officers’ are officers whose work is
directed and supervised at some level by others who were ap-
pointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of
the Senate.” 514
    Thus, officers who are not “inferior Officers” are principal offi-
cers who must be appointed by the President with the advice and
consent of the Senate in order to make sure that all the business
of the Executive will be conducted under the supervision of officers
appointed by the President with Senate approval.515 Further, the
Framers intended to limit the “diffusion” of the appointing power

the Constitution as capable of being vested by Congress with the appointing power.

     513 520 U.S. at 661–62.
     514 520 U.S. at 662–63. The case concerned whether the Secretary of Transpor-

tation, a presidential appointee with the advice and consent of the Senate, could
appoint judges of the Coast Guard Court of Military Appeals; necessarily, the judges
had to be “inferior” officers. In related cases, the Court held that designation or ap-
pointment of military judges, who are “officers of the United States,” does not vio-
late the Appointments Clause. The judges are selected by the Judge Advocate Gen-
eral of their respective branch of the Armed Forces. These military judges, however,
were already commissioned officers who had been appointed by the President with
the advice and consent of the Senate, so that their designation simply and permissi-
bly was an assignment to them of additional duties that did not need a second for-
mal appointment. Weiss v. United States, 510 U.S. 163 (1994). However, the appoint-
ment of civilian judges to the Coast Guard Court of Military Review by the same
method was impermissible; they had either to be appointed by an officer who could
exercise appointment-clause authority or by the President, and their actions were
not salvageable under the de facto officer doctrine. Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S.
