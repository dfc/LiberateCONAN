The counsel is assured full power and independent authority to in-
vestigate and, if warranted, to prosecute. Such counsel may be re-
moved from office by the Attorney General only for cause as pre-
scribed in the statute.60 The independent counsel was assuredly more
free from executive supervision than other federal prosecutors. In-
stead of striking down the law, however, the Court carefully as-
sessed the degree to which executive power was invaded and the
degree to which the President retained sufficient powers to carry
out his constitutionally assigned duties. The Court also considered
whether in enacting the statute Congress had attempted to aggran-
dize itself or had attempted to enlarge the judicial power at the
expense of the executive.61
    In the course of deciding that the President’s action in approv-
ing the closure of a military base, pursuant to statutory authority,
was not subject to judicial review, the Court enunciated a principle
that may mean a great deal, constitutionally speaking, or that may
not mean much of anything.62 The lower court had held that, al-
though review of presidential decisions on statutory grounds might
be precluded, his decisions were reviewable for constitutionality; in
that court’s view, whenever the President acts in excess of his statu-
tory authority, he also violates the Constitution’s separation-of-
powers doctrine. The Supreme Court found this analysis flawed. “Our
cases do not support the proposition that every action by the Presi-
dent, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory au-
thority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution. On the con-
trary, we have often distinguished between claims of constitutional
violations and claims that an official has acted in excess of his statu-
tory authority.” 63 Thus, the Court distinguished between executive
action undertaken without even the purported warrant of statutory
authorization and executive action in excess of statutory authority.
The former may violate separation of powers, but the latter will
not.64
