nal: it is limited to office holders, and judgments are limited to no
more than removal from office and disqualification to hold future
office.
     Impeachment was a device that figured from the first in the plans
proposed to the Convention; discussion addressed such questions as
what body was to try impeachments and what grounds were to be
stated as warranting impeachment.815 The attention of the Fram-
ers was for the most part fixed on the President and his removal,
and the results of this narrow frame of reference are reflected in
the questions unresolved by the language of the Constitution.

Persons Subject to Impeachment
     During the debate in the First Congress on the “removal” con-
troversy, it was contended by some members that impeachment was
the exclusive way to remove any officer of the government from his
post,816 but Madison and others contended that this position was
destructive of sound governmental practice,817 and the view did not
prevail. Impeachment, said Madison, was to be used to reach a bad
officer sheltered by the President and to remove him “even against
the will of the President; so that the declaration in the Constitu-
tion was intended as a supplementary security for the good behav-
ior of the public officers.” 818 While the language of section 4 covers
any “civil officer” in the executive branch,819 and covers judges as
well,820 it excludes military officers,821 and the precedent was early
established that it does not apply to members of Congress.822
     Judges.—Article III, section 1 specifically provides judges with
“good behavior” tenure, but the Constitution nowhere expressly vests
the power to remove upon bad behavior, and it has been assumed
that judges are made subject to the impeachment power through

     819 The term “civil officers of the United States” is not defined in the Constitu-

tion, although there may be a parallel with “officers of the United States” under the
Appointments Clause, Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and it may be assumed that not all execu-
tive branch employees are “officers.” For precedents relating to the definition, see 3
