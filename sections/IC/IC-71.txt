     Origin of the Conception.—How did this distinctive feature
of the Constitution come about, by virtue of which the treaty-
making authority is enabled to stamp upon its promises the qual-
ity of municipal law, thereby rendering them enforceable by the courts
without further action? The short answer is that Article VI, para-
graph 2, makes treaties the supreme law of the land on the same
footing with acts of Congress. The clause was a direct result of one
of the major weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. Although
the Articles entrusted the treaty-making power to Congress, fulfill-
ment of Congress’s promises was dependent on the state legisla-
tures.295 Particularly with regard to provisions of the Treaty of Peace
of 1783,296 in which Congress stipulated to protect the property rights
of British creditors of American citizens and of the former Loyal-
ists,297 the promises were not only ignored but were deliberately
flouted by many legislatures.298 Upon repeated British protests, John
Jay, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, suggested to Congress that
it request state legislatures to repeal all legislation repugnant to
the Treaty of Peace and to authorize their courts to carry the treaty
into effect.299 Although seven states did comply to some extent, the
impotency of Congress to effectuate its treaty guarantees was obvi-
ous to the Framers who devised Article VI, paragraph 2, to take
care of the situation.300
    Treaties and the States.—As it so happened, the first case in
which the Supreme Court dealt with the question of the effect of
treaties on state laws involved the same issue that had prompted
the drafting of Article VI, paragraph 2. During the Revolutionary
the Framers sought to prevent by enacting the Supremacy Clause.” Id. at 1384. On
August 5, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Medellin a stay of execution, Medel-
lin v. Texas, 129 S. Ct. 360 (2008) (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer
dissenting), and Texas executed him the same day.

     300 The Convention at first leaned toward giving Congress a negative over state

laws which were contrary to federal statutes or treaties, 1 M. Farrand, supra, at 47,
54, and then adopted the Paterson Plan which made treaties the supreme law of
the land, binding on state judges, and authorized the Executive to use force to com-
pel observance when such treaties were resisted. Id. at 245, 316, 2 id. at 27–29. In
the draft reported by the Committee on Detail, the language thus adopted was close
to the present Supremacy Clause; the draft omitted the authorization of force from
the clause, id. at 183, but in another clause the legislative branch was authorized to
call out the militia to, inter alia, “enforce treaties”. Id. at 182. The two words were
struck subsequently “as being superfluous” in view of the Supremacy Clause. Id. at
389–90.
