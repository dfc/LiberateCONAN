the President, by virtue of his own powers and the authority vested
in him by Congress,240 has used federal troops on a number of occa-
sions, five of them involving resistance to desegregation decrees in
the South.241 In 1957, Governor Faubus employed the Arkansas Na-
tional Guard to resist court-ordered desegregation in Little Rock,
and President Eisenhower dispatched federal soldiers and brought
the Guard under federal authority.242 In 1962, President Kennedy
dispatched federal troops to Oxford, Mississippi, when federal mar-
shals were unable to control with rioting that broke out upon the
admission of an African American student to the University of Mis-
sissippi.243 In June and September of 1964, President Johnson sent
troops into Alabama to enforce court decrees opening schools to
blacks.244 And, in 1965, the President used federal troops and fed-
eralized local Guardsmen to protect participants in a civil rights
march. The President justified his action on the ground that there
was a substantial likelihood of domestic violence because state au-
thorities were refusing to protect the marchers.245
