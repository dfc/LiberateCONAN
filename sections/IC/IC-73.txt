the treaty of 1850 with that country, to recover the estate of a rela-
tive dying intestate in Virginia, to sell the same, and to export the
proceeds of the sale.307
     Certain more recent cases stem from California legislation, most
of it directed against Japanese immigrants. A statute that excluded
aliens ineligible for American citizenship from owning real estate
was upheld in 1923 on the ground that the treaty in question did
not secure the rights claimed.308 But, in Oyama v. California,309 a
majority of the Court opined that this legislation conflicted with the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a view that
has since been endorsed by the California Supreme Court by a nar-
row majority.310 Meantime, California was informed that the rights
of German nationals, under the Treaty of December 8, 1923, be-
tween the United States and the Reich, to whom real property in
the United States had descended or been devised, to dispose of it,
had survived the recent war and certain war legislation, and accord-
ingly prevailed over conflicting state legislation.311
     307 See also Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258 (1890); Sullivan v. Kidd, 254 U.S.

433 (1921); Nielsen v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 47 (1929); Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 187
(1961). But a right under treaty to acquire and dispose of property does not except
aliens from the operation of a state statute prohibiting conveyances of homestead
property by any instrument not executed by both husband and wife. Todok v. Union
State Bank, 281 U.S. 449 (1930). Nor was a treaty stipulation guaranteeing to the
citizens of each country, in the territory of the other, equality with the natives of
rights and privileges in respect to protection and security of person and property,
violated by a state statute which denied to a non-resident alien wife of a person
killed within the State, the right to sue for wrongful death. Such right was afforded
to native resident relatives. Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., 213 U.S. 268 (1909).
The treaty in question having been amended in view of this decision, the question
arose whether the new provision covered the case of death without fault or negli-
gence in which, by the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, compensation
was expressly limited to resident parents; the Supreme Court held that it did not.

410 (1948), in which a California statute prohibiting the issuance of fishing licenses
to persons ineligible to citizenship was disallowed, both on the basis of the Four-
teenth Amendment and on the ground that the statute invaded a field of power re-
served to the National Government, namely, the determination of the conditions on
which aliens may be admitted, naturalized, and permitted to reside in the United
States. For the latter proposition, Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 66 (1941), was
relied upon.
     310 This occurred in the much advertised case of Sei Fujii v. State, 38 Cal.2d

718, 242 P.2d 617 (1952). A lower California court had held that the legislation in-
volved was void under the United Nations Charter, but the California Supreme Court
was unanimous in rejecting this view. The Charter provisions invoked in this connec-
tion [Arts. 1, 55 and 56], said Chief Justice Gibson, “[w]e are satisfied . . . were not
intended to supersede domestic legislation.” That is, the Charter provisions were
not self-executing. RESTATEMENT, FOREIGN RELATIONS, supra, § 701, Reporters’ Note 5,
