nate treaties, but the Supreme Court, no majority agreeing on a
common ground, vacated that decision and instructed the trial court
to dismiss the suit.396 Although no Court opinion bars future litiga-
tion, it appears that the political question doctrine or some other
rule of judicial restraint will leave such disputes to the contending
forces of the political branches.397
    Determination Whether a Treaty Has Lapsed.—There is clear
judicial recognition that the President may without consulting Con-
gress validly determine the question whether specific treaty provi-
sions have lapsed. The following passage from Justice Lurton’s opin-
ion in Charlton v. Kelly 398 is pertinent: “If the attitude of Italy was,
as contended, a violation of the obligation of the treaty, which, in
international law, would have justified the United States in denounc-
ing the treaty as no longer obligatory, it did not automatically have
that effect. If the United States elected not to declare its abroga-
tion, or come to a rupture, the treaty would remain in force. It was
only voidable, not void; and if the United States should prefer, it
might waive any breach which in its judgment had occurred and
conform to its own obligation as if there had been no such breach. . . .
That the political branch of the government recognizes the treaty
obligation as still existing is evidenced by its action in this case. . . .
The executive department having thus elected to waive any right
to free itself from the obligation to deliver up its own citizens, it is
the plain duty of this court to recognize the obligation to surrender
the appellant as one imposed by the treaty as the supreme law of
the land as affording authority for the warrant of extradition.” 399
So also it is primarily for the political departments to determine
whether certain provisions of a treaty have survived a war in which
the other contracting state ceased to exist as a member of the inter-
national community.400
     Status of a Treaty a Political Question.—It is clear that many
questions which arise concerning a treaty are of a political nature
and will not be decided by the courts. In the words of Justice Cur-
tis in Taylor v. Morton: 401 It is not “a judicial question, whether a
treaty with a foreign sovereign has been violated by him; whether

     396 Goldwater v. Carter, 617 F.2d 697 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (en banc), vacated and

remanded, 444 U.S. 996 (1979). Four Justices found the case nonjusticiable because
of the political question doctrine, id. at 1002, but one other Justice in the majority
and one in dissent rejected this analysis. Id. at 998 (Justice Powell), 1006 (Justice
Brennan). The remaining three Justices were silent on the doctrine.
