Martial Law and Constitutional Limitations
    Two theories of martial law are reflected in decisions of the Su-
preme Court. The first, which stems from the Petition of Right, 1628,
provides that the common law knows no such thing as martial law; 202
that is to say, martial law is not established by official authority of
any sort, but arises from the nature of things, being the law of para-
mount necessity, leaving the civil courts to be the final judges of
necessity.203 By the second theory, martial law can be validly and
constitutionally established by supreme political authority in war-
time. In the early years of the Supreme Court, the American judi-
ciary embraced the latter theory as it held in Luther v. Borden 204
that state declarations of martial law were conclusive and there-
fore not subject to judicial review.205 In this case, the Court found
that the Rhode Island legislature had been within its rights in re-
sorting to the rights and usages of war in combating insurrection
in that state. The decision in the Prize Cases,206 although not deal-
ing directly with the subject of martial law, gave national scope to
the same general principle in 1863.
    The Civil War being safely over, however, a divided Court, in
the elaborately argued Milligan case,207 reverting to the older doc-
trine, pronounced President Lincoln’s action void, following his sus-
pension of the writ of habeas corpus in September, 1863, in order-
ing the trial by military commission of persons held in custody as
“spies” and “abettors of the enemy.” The salient passage of the Court’s
opinion bearing on this point is the following: “If, in foreign inva-
sion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible
to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the the-
ater of active military operations, where war really prevails, there
is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus
