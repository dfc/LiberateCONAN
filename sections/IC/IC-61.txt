it is tendered; and if it be rejected, we have discovered no power in
a court to force it on him.” Marshall continued to hold that to be
noticed judicially this deed must be pleaded, like any private instru-
ment.250
     In Burdick v. United States,251 Marshall’s doctrine was put to a
test that seems to have overtaxed it, perhaps fatally. Burdick, hav-
ing declined to testify before a federal grand jury on the ground
that his testimony would tend to incriminate him, was proffered by
President Wilson “a full and unconditional pardon for all offenses
against the United States,” which he might have committed or par-
ticipated in in connection with the matter he had been questioned
about. Burdick, nevertheless, refused to accept the pardon and per-
sisted in his contumacy with the unanimous support of the Su-
preme Court. “The grace of a pardon,” remarked Justice McKenna
sententiously, “may be only a pretense . . . involving consequences
of even greater disgrace than those from which it purports to re-
lieve. Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the pen-
alties of the law. If so brought, escape by confession of guilt im-
plied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected . . . .” 252 Nor
did the Court give any attention to the fact that the President had
accompanied his proffer to Burdick with a proclamation, although
a similar procedure had been held to bring President Johnson’s am-
nesties to the Court’s notice.253 In 1927, however, in sustaining the
right of the President to commute a sentence of death to one of life
imprisonment, against the will of the prisoner, the Court aban-
doned this view. “A pardon in our days,” it said, “is not a private
act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a
part of the constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determi-
nation of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be bet-
ter served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.” 254 Whether
these words sound the death knell of the acceptance doctrine is per-
haps doubtful.255 They seem clearly to indicate that by substituting
a commutation order for a deed of pardon, a President can always

Walker, 161 U.S. 591 (1896), the Court had said: “It is almost a necessary corollary
of the above propositions that, if the witness has already received a pardon, he can-
not longer set up his privilege, since he stands with respect to such offence as if it
had never been committed.” Id. at 599, citing British cases.
