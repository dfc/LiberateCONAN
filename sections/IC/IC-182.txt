cally unless Congressional approval were given.” 773 He then re-
viewed the proceedings of Congress that attended the enactment of
the Taft-Hartley Act and concluded that “Congress has expressed
its will to withhold this power [of seizure] from the President as
though it had said so in so many words.” 774
    Justice Jackson attempted a schematic representation of presi-
dential powers, which “are not fixed but fluctuate, depending upon
their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.” Thus, there
are essentially three possibilities. “1. When the President acts pur-
suant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his au-
thority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possess in his
own right plus all that Congress can delegate. . . . 2. When the Presi-
dent acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of au-
thority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there
is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concur-
rent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. . . . 3. When
the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or
implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he
can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any consti-
tutional powers of Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain ex-
clusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Con-
gress from acting upon the subject.” 775 The seizure in question was
placed in the third category “because Congress has not left seizure
of private property an open field but has covered it by three statu-
tory policies inconsistent with this seizure.” Therefore, “we can sus-
tain the President only by holding that seizure of such strike-
bound industries is within his domain and beyond control by
Congress.” 776 That holding was not possible.
    Justice Burton, referring to the Taft-Hartley Act, said that “the
most significant feature of that Act is its omission of authority to
seize,” citing debate on the measure to show that the omission was
a conscious decision.777 Justice Clark relied on Little v. Barreme,778

tice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion joined by three other Justices, endorsed “the
three-part scheme used by Justice Jackson” as “[t]he proper framework for assess-
ing whether Executive actions are authorized.” The Court in this case found “that
the military commission convened [by the President, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba] to
try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate [the
Uniform Code of Military Justice].” Id. at 567. Thus, as Justice Kennedy noted, “the
President has acted in a field with a history of congressional participation and regu-
lation.” Id. at 638.
