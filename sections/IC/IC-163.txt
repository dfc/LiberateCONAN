budgetary responsibility provided for mandatory reporting of im-
poundments to Congress, for congressional disapproval of impound-
ments, and for court actions by the Comptroller General to compel
spending or obligation of funds.691
     Generally speaking, the law recognized two types of impound-
ments: “routine” or “programmatic” reservations of budget author-
ity to provide for the inevitable contingencies that arise in adminis-
tering congressionally-funded programs and “policy” decisions that
are ordinarily intended to advance the broader fiscal or other policy
objectives of the executive branch contrary to congressional wishes
in appropriating funds in the first place.
    Routine reservations were to come under the terms of a revised
Anti-Deficiency Act.692 Prior to its amendment, this law had permit-
ted the President to “apportion” funds “to provide for contingen-
cies, or to effect savings whenever savings are made possible by or
through changes in requirements, greater efficiency of operations,
or other developments subsequent to the date on which such appro-
priation was made available.” President Nixon had relied on this
“other developments” language as authorization to impound, for what
in essence were policy reasons.693 Congress deleted the contro-
verted clause and retained the other language to authorize reserva-
tions to maintain funds for contingencies and to effect savings made
possible in carrying out the program; it added a clause permitting
reserves “as specifically provided by law.” 694
     “Policy” impoundments were to be reported to Congress by the
President as permanent rescissions and, perhaps, as temporary de-
ferrals.695 Rescissions are merely recommendations or proposals of
the President and must be authorized by a bill or joint resolution,
or, after 45 days from the presidential message, the funds must be
made available for obligation.696 Temporary deferrals of budget au-
thority for less than a full fiscal year, as provided in the 1974 law,
were to be effective unless either the House of Representatives or
