gued that the Impeachment Clause necessarily required indict-
ment and trial in a criminal proceeding to follow a successful im-
peachment and that a President in any event was uniquely immune
from indictment, and these arguments were advanced as one ground
to deny enforcement of the subpoenas running to the President.790
Assertion of the same argument by Vice President Agnew was con-
troverted by the government, through the Solicitor General, but, as
to the President, it was argued that for a number of constitutional
and practical reasons he was not subject to ordinary criminal pro-

    Finally, most recently, the Court has definitively resolved one
of the intertwined issues of presidential accountability. The Presi-
dent is absolutely immune in actions for civil damages for all acts
within the “outer perimeter” of his official duties.792 The Court’s close
decision was premised on the President’s “unique position in the
constitutional scheme,” that is, it was derived from the Court’s in-
quiry of a “kind of ‘public policy’ analysis” of the “policies and prin-
ciples that may be considered implicit in the nature of the Presi-
dent’s office in a system structured to achieve effective government
under a constitutionally mandated separation of powers.” 793 Al-

munity in matters arising from “speech or debate,” and although it
was silent with respect to presidential immunity, the Court none-
theless considered such immunity “a functionally mandated inci-
dent of the President’s unique office, rooted in the constitutional tra-
dition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.” 794
Although the Court relied in part upon its previous practice of find-
ing immunity for officers, such as judges, as to whom the Constitu-
tion is silent, although a long common-law history exists, and in
part upon historical evidence, which it admitted was fragmentary
and ambiguous,795 the Court’s principal focus was upon the fact that
the President was distinguishable from all other executive officials.
He is charged with a long list of “supervisory and policy responsi-

that petition without reaching the question. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 687
