some fundamental or essential principle of government or highly
prejudicial to the public interest, and this may consist of a viola-
tion of the Constitution, of law, of an official oath, or of duty, by an
act committed or omitted, or, without violating a positive law, by
the abuse of discretionary powers from improper motives or for an
improper purpose.” 854 Former Justice Benjamin Curtis contro-
verted this argument, saying: “My first position is, that when the
Constitution speaks of ‘treason, bribery, and other high crimes and
misdemeanors,’ it refers to, and includes only, high criminal of-
fences against the United States, made so by some law of the United
States existing when the acts complained of were done, and I say
that this is plainly to be inferred from each and every provision of
the Constitution on the subject of impeachment.” 855 The Presi-
dent’s acquittal by a single vote was no doubt not the result of a
choice between the two theories, but the result may be said to have
placed a gloss on the impeachment language approximating the theory
of the defense.856

The Nixon Impeachment Proceedings
     For the first time in more than a hundred years,857 Congress
moved to impeach the President of the United States, a move fore-
stalled only by the resignation of President Nixon on August 9, 1974.858
Three articles of impeachment were approved by the House Judi-
     854 1 TRIAL OF ANDREW JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON IMPEACHMENT 88,

147 (1868).
     855 Id. at 409.
     856 For an account of the Johnson proceedings, see WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST, GRAND

INQUESTS: THE HISTORIC IMPEACHMENTS OF JUSTICE SAMUEL CHASE AND PRESIDENT ANDREW JOHN-
SON (1992).
     857 The only occasion before the Johnson impeachment when impeachment of a

President had come to a House vote was the House’s rejection in 1843 of an impeach-
ment resolution against President John Tyler. The resolution, which listed nine sepa-
rate counts and which was proposed by a member rather than by a committee, was
defeated by vote of 127 to 84. See 3 HINDS’ PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
§ 2398 (1907); CONG. GLOBE, 27th Cong. 3d Sess. 144–46 (1843).
     858 The President’s resignation did not necessarily require dismissal of the im-

peachment charges. Judgment upon conviction can include disqualification as well
as removal. Art. I, § 3, cl. 7. Precedent from the 1876 impeachment of Secretary of
War William Belknap, who had resigned prior to his impeachment by the House,
suggests that impeachment can proceed even after a resignation. See 3 HINDS’ PREC-
EDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, § 2445 (1907). The Belknap precedent may be
somewhat weakened, however, by the fact that his acquittal was based in part on
the views of some Senators that impeachment should not be applied to someone no
longer in office, id. at § 2467, although the Senate had earlier rejected (by majority
vote of 37–29) a resolution disclaiming jurisdiction, and had adopted by vote of 35–22
a resolution affirming that result See id. at § 2007 for an extensive summary of the
Senate’s consideration of the issue. See also id, § 2317 (it had been conceded during
the 1797 proceedings against Senator William Blount, who had been sequestered
from his seat in the Senate, that an impeached officer could not escape punishment
by resignation).
