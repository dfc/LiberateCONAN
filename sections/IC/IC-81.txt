    The foremost example of this interpretation is Missouri v. Hol-
land.351 There, the United States and Great Britain had entered
into a treaty for the protection of migratory birds,352 and Congress
had enacted legislation pursuant to the treaty to effectuate it.353
Missouri objected that such regulation was reserved to the states
by the Tenth Amendment and that the statute infringed on this res-
ervation, pointing to lower court decisions voiding an earlier act not
based on a treaty.354 Noting that treaties “are declared the su-
preme law of the land,” Justice Holmes for the Court said: “If the
treaty is valid there can be no dispute about the validity of the stat-
ute under Article I, § 8, as a necessary and proper means to ex-
ecute the powers of the Government.” 355 “It is obvious,” he contin-
ued, “that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the
national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but
that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to
be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, ‘a power which
must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized govern-
ment’ is not to be found.” 356 Because the treaty and thus the stat-
ute dealt with a matter of national and international concern, the
treaty was proper and the statute was “necessary and proper” to
effectuate the treaty.

Constitutional Limitations on the Treaty Power
    A question growing out of the discussion above is whether the
treaty power is bounded by constitutional limitations. By the Su-
premacy Clause, both statutes and treaties “are declared . . . to be
the supreme law of the land, and no superior efficacy is given to
either over the other.” 357 As statutes may be held void because they
contravene the Constitution, it should follow that treaties may be
held void, the Constitution being superior to both. And indeed the

Cullagh, 221 F. 288 (D. Kan. 1915). The Court did not purport to decide whether
those cases were correctly decided. Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 433 (1920).
Today, there seems no doubt that Congress’s power under the commerce clause would
be deemed more than adequate, but at that time a majority of the Court had a very
restrictive view of the commerce power. Cf. Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251
(1918).
