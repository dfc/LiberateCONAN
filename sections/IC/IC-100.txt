ing been a formal exchange of ratifications.448 Of a kindred type,
and owing much to the President’s capacity as Commander in Chief,
was a series of agreements entered into with Mexico between 1882
and 1896 according each country the right to pursue marauding In-
dians across the common border.449 Commenting on such an agree-
ment, the Court remarked, a bit uncertainly: “While no act of Con-
gress authorizes the executive department to permit the introduction
of foreign troops, the power to give such permission without legisla-
tive assent was probably assumed to exist from the authority of the
President as commander in chief of the military and naval forces of
the United States. It may be doubted, however, whether such power
could be extended to the apprehension of deserters [from foreign
vessels] in the absence of positive legislation to that effect.” 450 Jus-
tice Gray and three other Justices believed that such action by the
President must rest upon express treaty or statute.451
    Notable expansion of presidential power in this field first be-
came manifest in the administration of President McKinley. At the
outset of war with Spain, the President proclaimed that the United
States would consider itself bound for the duration by the last three
principles of the Declaration of Paris, a course which, as Professor
Wright observes, “would doubtless go far toward establishing these
three principles as international law obligatory upon the United States
in future wars.” 452 Hostilities with Spain were brought to an end
in August, 1898, by an armistice the conditions of which largely de-
termined the succeeding treaty of peace,453 just as did the Armi-
stice of November 11, 1918, determine in great measure the condi-
tions of the final peace with Germany in 1918. It was also President
McKinley who in 1900, relying on his own sole authority as Com-
mander in Chief, contributed a land force of 5,000 men and a na-
val force to cooperate with similar contingents from other Powers
to rescue the legations in Peking from the Boxers; a year later, again
without consulting either Congress or the Senate, he accepted for
the United States the Boxer Indemnity Protocol between China and
the intervening Powers.454 Commenting on the Peking protocol, Wil-
loughby quotes with approval the following remark: “This case is
interesting, because it shows how the force of circumstances com-
