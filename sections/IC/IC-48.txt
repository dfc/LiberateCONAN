sensus has emerged, and there is little evidence that there exists
within Congress the resolve to exercise the responsibility concomi-

The President as Commander of the Armed Forces
     While the President customarily delegates supreme command
of the forces in active service, there is no constitutional reason why
he should do so, and he has been known to resolve personally im-
portant questions of military policy. Lincoln early in 1862 issued
orders for a general advance in the hopes of stimulating McClellan
to action; Wilson in 1918 settled the question of an independent Ameri-
can command on the Western Front; Truman in 1945 ordered that
the bomb be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.185 As against an
enemy in the field, the President possesses all the powers which
are accorded by international law to any supreme commander. “He
may invade the hostile country, and subject it to the sovereignty
and authority of the United States.” 186 In the absence of attempts
by Congress to limit his power, he may establish and prescribe the
jurisdiction and procedure of military commissions, and of tribu-
nals in the nature of such commissions, in territory occupied by Armed
Forces of the United States, and his authority to do this sometimes
survives cessation of hostilities.187 He may employ secret agents to
enter the enemy’s lines and obtain information as to its strength,
resources, and movements.188 He may, at least with the assent of
Congress, authorize commercial intercourse with the enemy.189 He
may also requisition property and compel services from American
citizens and friendly aliens who are situated within the theater of
military operations when necessity requires, thereby incurring for
the United States the obligation to render “just compensation.” 190
By the same warrant, he may bring hostilities to a conclusion by
arranging an armistice, stipulating conditions that may determine
