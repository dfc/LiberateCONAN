cil on the President.246 The idea ultimately failed, partly because of
the diversity of ideas concerning the council’s make-up. One mem-
ber wished it to consist of “members of the two houses,” another
wished it to comprise two representatives from each of three sec-
tions, “with a rotation and duration of office similar to those of the
Senate.” The proposal with the strongest backing was that it should
consist of the heads of departments and the Chief Justice, who should
preside when the President was absent. Of this proposal the only
part to survive was the above cited provision. The consultative re-
lation here contemplated is an entirely one-sided affair, is to be con-
ducted with each principal officer separately and in writing, and is
to relate only to the duties of their respective offices.247 The Cabi-
net, as we know it today, that is to say, the Cabinet meeting, was
brought about solely on the initiative of the first President,248 and
may be dispensed with on presidential initiative at any time, being
totally unknown to the Constitution. Several Presidents have in fact
reduced the Cabinet meeting to little more than a ceremony with
social trimmings.249

                       PARDONS AND REPRIEVES

The Legal Nature of a Pardon
     In the first case to be decided concerning the pardoning power,
Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, said: “As this power
had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive of that
nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial insti-
tution ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their principles re-
specting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their
books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used
by the person who would avail himself of it. A pardon is an act of
grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of
the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed,
from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed.
It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, de-
livered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not
communicated officially to the Court. . . . A pardon is a deed, to the
validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete
without acceptance. It may then be rejected by the person to whom
