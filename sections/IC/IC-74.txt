    Treaties and Congress.—In the Convention, a proposal to re-
quire the adoption of treaties through enactment of a law before
they should be binding was rejected.312 But the years since have
seen numerous controversies with regard to the duties and obliga-
tions of Congress, the necessity for congressional action, and the
effects of statutes, in connection with the treaty power. For pur-
poses of this section, the question is whether entry into and ratifi-
cation of a treaty is sufficient in all cases to make the treaty provi-
sions the “law of the land” or whether there are some types of treaty
provisions that only a subsequent act of Congress can put into ef-
fect. The language quoted above 313 from Foster v. Neilson 314 early
established that not all treaties are self-executing, for, as Marshall
said in that decision, a treaty is “to be regarded in courts of justice
as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of
itself, without the aid of any legislative provision.” 315
     Leaving aside the question of when a treaty is and is not self-
executing,316 the issue of the necessity of congressional implemen-
tation and the obligation to implement has frequently roiled con-
gressional debates. The matter arose initially in 1796 in connection
with the Jay Treaty,317 certain provisions of which required appro-
priations to carry them into effect. In view of Article I, § 9, clause
7, which says that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury,
but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . . ,” it seems
to have been universally conceded that Congress must be applied
to if the treaty provisions were to be executed.318 A bill was intro-
duced in the House to appropriate the needed funds, and its sup-
porters, within and without Congress, argued that, because the treaty
was the law of the land, the legislative branch was bound to enact
the bill without further ado; opponents led by Madison and Albert
Gallatin contended that the House had complete discretion whether

are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them
into effect . . . . If the treaty contains stipulations which are self-executing that is,
require no legislation to make them operative, to that extent they have the force
and effect of a legislative enactment.” See S. Crandall, supra, chs. 11–15.
