    Finally, the Clinton impeachment raised the issue of what the
threshold is for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” While the Nixon
charges were premised on the assumption that an abuse of power
need not be a criminal offense to be an impeachable offense,874 the
Clinton proceedings—or at least the perjury charge—raised the is-
sue of whether criminal offenses that do not rise to the level of an
abuse of power may nonetheless be impeachable offenses.875 The
House’s vote to impeach President Clinton arguably amounted to
an affirmative answer,876 but the Senate’s acquittal leaves the mat-
ter somewhat unsettled.877 There appeared to be broad consensus
in the Senate that some private crimes not involving an abuse of
power (e.g., murder for personal reasons) are so outrageous as to
constitute grounds for removal,878 but there was no consensus on
where the threshold for outrageousness lies, and there was no con-
sensus that the perjury and obstruction of justice with which Presi-
     874 According to one scholar, the three articles of impeachment against Presi-

dent Nixon epitomized the “paradigm” for presidential impeachment—abuse of power
in which there is “not only serious injury to the constitutional order but also a nexus
between the misconduct of an impeachable official and the official’s formal duties.”

     875 Although committing perjury in a judicial proceeding—regardless of purpose

or subject matter—impedes the proper functioning of the judiciary both by frustrat-
ing the search for truth and by breeding disrespect for courts, and consequently may
be viewed as an (impeachable) “offense against the state” (see 145 CONG. REC. S1556
(daily ed. Feb. 12, 1999) (statement of Sen. Thompson)), such perjury arguably con-
stitutes an abuse of power only if the purpose or subject matter of the perjury re-
lates to official duties or to aggrandizement of power. Note that one of the charges
against President Clinton recommended by the House Judiciary Committee but re-
jected by the full House—providing false responses to the Committee’s interrogatories—
was squarely premised on an abuse of power.
     876 The House vote can be viewed as rejecting the views of a number of law

professors, presented in a letter to the Speaker entered into the Congressional Re-
cord, arguing that high crimes and misdemeanors must involve “grossly derelict ex-
ercise of official power.” 144 CONG. REC. H9649 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1998).
     877 Some Senators who explained their acquittal votes rejected the idea that the

particular crimes that President Clinton was alleged to have committed amounted
to impeachable offenses (see, e.g., 145 CONG. REC. S1560 (daily ed. Feb. 12, 1999)
(statement of Sen. Moynihan); id. at 1601 (statement of Sen. Lieberman)), some al-
leged failure of proof (see, e.g., id. at 1539 (statement of Sen. Specter); id. at 1581
(statement of Sen. Akaka)), and some cited both grounds (see, e.g., id. at S1578–91
(statement of Sen. Leahy), and id. at S1627 (statement of Sen. Hollings)).
     878 See, e.g., 145 CONG. REC. S1525 (daily ed. Feb. 12, 1999) (statement of Sen.

Cleland) (accepting the proposition that murder and other crimes would qualify for
impeachment and removal, but contending that “the current case does not reach the
necessary high standard”); id. at S1533 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (impeachment can-
not be limited to wrongful official conduct, but must include murder); and id. at S1592
(statement of Sen. Leahy) (acknowledging that “heinous” crimes such as murder would
warrant removal). This idea, incidentally, was not new; one Senator in the First Con-
gress apparently assumed that impeachment would be the first recourse if a Presi-
dent were to commit a murder. IX DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF THE FIRST FEDERAL CON-
