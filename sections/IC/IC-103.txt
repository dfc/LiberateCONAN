half the countries of the world protect themselves.465 Congressional
disquietude did not result in anything more substantial than pas-
sage of a “sense of the Senate” resolution expressing a desire that
“national commitments” be made more solemnly in the future than
in the past.466

The Domestic Obligation of Executive Agreements
    When the President enters into an executive agreement, what
sort of obligation does it impose on the United States? That it may
impose international obligations of potentially serious conse-
quences is obvious and that such obligations may linger for long
periods of time is equally obvious.467 Not so obvious is the nature
of the domestic obligations imposed by executive agreements. Do
treaties and executive agreements have the same domestic ef-
fect? 468 Treaties preempt state law through operation of the Su-
premacy Clause. Although it may be that executive agreements en-
tered into pursuant to congressional authorization or treaty obligation
also derive preemptive force from the Supremacy Clause, that tex-
tual basis for preemption is arguably lacking for executive agree-
ments resting solely on the President’s constitutional powers.
    Initially, it was the view of most judges and scholars that execu-
tive agreements based solely on presidential power did not become
the “law of the land” pursuant to the Supremacy Clause because
such agreements are not “treaties” ratified by the Senate.469 The
Supreme Court, however, found another basis for holding state laws
to be preempted by executive agreements, ultimately relying on the
Constitution’s vesting of foreign relations power in the national gov-
ernment.

     467 In 1918, Secretary of State Lansing assured the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee that the Lansing-Ishii Agreement had no binding force on the United
States, that it was simply a declaration of American policy so long as the President
and State Department might choose to continue it. 1 W. Willoughby, supra at 547.
In fact, it took the Washington Conference of 1921, two formal treaties, and an ex-
change of notes to eradicate it, while the “Gentlemen’s Agreement” was finally ended
after 17 years only by an act of Congress. W. McClure, supra at 97, 100.
