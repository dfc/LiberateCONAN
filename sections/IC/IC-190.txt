       moved.810 By an opinion of the Attorney General many years later,
       however, the President, even after he has signed a commission, still
       has a locus poenitentiae and may withhold it; nor is the appointee
       in office till he has this commission.811 This is probably the correct
       doctrine.812

    SECTION 4. The President, Vice President and all civil Offi-
cers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high
Crimes and Misdemeanors.

                                  IMPEACHMENT
           The impeachment provisions of the Constitution 813 were de-
       rived from English practice, but there are important differences. In
       England, impeachment had a far broader scope. While impeach-
       ment was a device to remove from office one who abused his office
       or misbehaved but who was protected by the Crown, it could be
       used against anyone—office holder or not—and was penal in na-
       ture, with possible penalties of fines, imprisonment, or even death.814
       By contrast, the American impeachment process is remedial, not pe-
            810 Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137, 157–58, 173 (1803). The doctrine

       applies to presidential appointments regardless of whether Senate confirmation is
       required.
            811 12 Ops. Atty. Gen. 306 (1867).
            812 For various reasons, Marbury got neither commission nor office. The case

       assumes, in fact, the necessity of possession of his commission by the appointee.
            813 Impeachment is the subject of several other provisions of the Constitution.

       Article I, § 2, cl. 5, gives to the House of Representatives “the sole power of impeach-
       ment.” Article I, § 3, cl. 6, gives to the Senate “the sole power to try all impeach-
       ments,” requires that Senators be under oath or affirmation when sitting for that
       purpose, stipulates that the Chief Justice of the United States is to preside when
       the President of the United States is tried, and provides for conviction on the vote
       of two-thirds of the members present. Article I, § 3, cl. 7, limits the judgment after
       impeachment to removal from office and disqualification from future federal office
       holding, but it allows criminal trial following conviction upon impeachment. Article
       II, § 2, cl. 1, deprives the President of the power to grant pardons or reprieves in
       cases of impeachment. Article III,§ 2, cl. 3, excepts impeachment cases from the jury
       trial requirement.
            Although the word “impeachment” is sometimes used to refer to the process by
       which any member of the House may “impeach” an officer of the United States un-
       der a question of constitutional privilege (see 3 HINDS’ PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE OF
       REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES §§ 2398 (impeachment of President John Tyler
       by a member) and 2469 (impeachment of Judge John Swayne by a member) (1907),
       the word as used in Article II, § 4 refers to impeachment by vote of the House, the
       consequence of which is that the Senate may then try the impeached officer.
