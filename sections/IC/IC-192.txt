being labeled “civil officers.” 823 The records in the Convention make
this a plausible though not necessary interpretation.824 And, in fact,
eleven of the fifteen impeachments reaching trial in the Senate have
been directed at federal judges, and all seven of those convicted in
impeachment trials have been judges.825 So settled apparently is

     823 See NATIONAL COMM’N ON JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE & REMOVAL, REPORT OF THE NATIONAL

COMM’N ON JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE & REMOVAL 9–11 (1993). The Commission was charged
by Congress with investigating and studying problems and issues relating to disci-
pline and removal of federal judges, to evaluate the advisability of developing alter-
natives to impeachment, and to report to the three Government Branches. Pub. L.
101–650, 104 Stat. 5124. The report and the research papers produced for it contain
a wealth of information on the subject.
     824 For practically the entire Convention, the plans presented and adopted pro-

vided that the Supreme Court was to try impeachments. 1 M. Farrand, supra, at
22, 244, 223–24, 231; 2 id. at 186. On August 27, it was successfully moved that the
provision in the draft of the Committee on Detail giving the Supreme Court jurisdic-
tion of trials of impeachment be postponed, id. at 430, 431, which was one of the
issues committed to the Committee of Eleven. Id. at 481. That Committee reported
the provision giving the Senate power to try all impeachments, id. at 497, which
the Convention thereafter approved. Id. at 551. It may be assumed that so long as
trial was in the Supreme Court, the Framers did not intend that the Justices, at
least, were to be subject to the process.
     The Committee of Five on August 20 was directed to report “a mode for trying
the supreme Judges in cases of impeachment,” id. at 337, and it returned a provi-
sion making Supreme Court Justices triable by the Senate on impeachment by the
House. Id. at 367. Consideration of this report was postponed. On August 27, it was
proposed that all federal judges should be removable by the executive upon the ap-
plication of both houses of Congress, but the motion was rejected. Id. at 428–29.
The matter was not resolved by the report of the Committee on Style, which left in
the “good behavior” tenure but contained nothing about removal. Id. at 575. There-
fore, unless judges were included in the term “civil officers,” which had been added
without comment on September 8 to the impeachment clause, id. at 552, they were
not made removable.
