                             THE TREATY-MAKING POWER

       President and Senate
            The plan that the Committee of Detail reported to the Federal
       Convention on August 6, 1787 provided that “the Senate of the United
       States shall have power to make treaties, and to appoint Ambassa-
       dors, and Judges of the Supreme Court.” 277 Not until September 7,
       ten days before the Convention’s final adjournment, was the Presi-
       dent made a participant in these powers.278 The constitutional clause
       evidently assumes that the President and Senate will be associated
       throughout the entire process of making a treaty, although Jay, writ-
       ing in The Federalist, foresaw that the initiative must often be seized
       by the President without benefit of senatorial counsel.279 Yet, so late
       as 1818 Rufus King, Senator from New York, who had been a mem-
       ber of the Convention, declared on the floor of the Senate: “In these
       concerns the Senate are the Constitutional and the only respon-
       sible counselors of the President. And in this capacity the Senate
       may, and ought to, look into and watch over every branch of the
       foreign affairs of the nation; they may, therefore, at any time call
       for full and exact information respecting the foreign affairs, and ex-
       press their opinion and advice to the President respecting the same,
       when, and under whatever other circumstances, they may think such
       advice expedient.” 280
            Negotiation, a Presidential Monopoly.—Actually, the nego-
       tiation of treaties had long since been taken over by the President;
       the Senate’s role in relation to treaties is today essentially legisla-
       tive in character.281 “He alone negotiates. Into the field of negotia-
       tion, the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to

             281 Washington sought to use the Senate as a council, but the effort proved fu-

       tile, principally because the Senate balked. For the details see E. Corwin, supra, at
