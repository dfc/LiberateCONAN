ing the removal power down to the Civil War, which was held to
yield the following results: “Article II grants to the President the
executive power of the Government, i.e., the general administra-
tive control of those executing the laws, including the power of ap-
pointment and removal of executive officers—a conclusion con-
firmed by his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed; that Article II excludes the exercise of legislative power
by Congress to provide for appointments and removals, except only
as granted therein to Congress in the matter of inferior offices; that
Congress is only given power to provide for appointments and re-
movals of inferior officers after it has vested, and on condition that
it does vest, their appointment in other authority than the Presi-
dent with the Senate’s consent; that the provisions of the second
section of Article II, which blend action by the legislative branch,
or by part of it, in the work of the executive, are limitations to be
strictly construed and not to be extended by implication; that the
President’s power of removal is further established as an incident
to his specifically enumerated function of appointment by and with
the advice of the Senate, but that such incident does not by impli-
cation extend to removals the Senate’s power of checking appoint-
ments; and finally that to hold otherwise would make it impossible
for the President, in case of political or other differences with the
Senate or Congress, to take care that the laws be faithfully ex-
ecuted.” 555
    The holding in Myers boils down to the proposition that the Con-
stitution endows the President with an illimitable power to remove
all officers in whose appointment he has participated, with the ex-
ception of federal judges. The motivation of the holding was not, it
may be assumed, any ambition on the Chief Justice’s part to set
history aright—or awry.556 Rather, it was the concern that he voiced

    556  The reticence of the Constitution respecting removal left room for four possi-
bilities: first, the one suggested by the common law doctrine of “estate in office,”
from which the conclusion followed that the impeachment power was the only power
of removal intended by the Constitution; second, that the power of removal was an
incident of the power of appointment and hence belonged, at any rate in the ab-
sence of legal or other provision to the contrary, to the appointing authority; third,
that Congress could, by virtue of its power “to make all laws which shall be neces-
sary and proper,” etc., determine the location of the removal power; fourth, that the
President by virtue of his “executive power” and his duty “to take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed,” possesses the power of removal over all officers of the
United States except judges. In the course of the debate on the act to establish a
Department of Foreign Affairs (later changed to Department of State) all of these
views were put forward, with the final result that a clause was incorporated in the
measure that implied, as pointed out above, that the head of the department would
be removable by the President at his discretion. Contemporaneously, and indeed un-
til after the Civil War, this action by Congress, in other words “the decision of 1789,”
