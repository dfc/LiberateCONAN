     The Myers Case.—However much the two arguments are still
subject to dispute, Chief Justice Taft, himself a former President,
appears in Myers v. United States 22 to have carried a majority of
the Court with him in establishing the Hamiltonian conception as
official doctrine. That case confirmed one reading of the “Decision
of 1789” in holding the removal power to be constitutionally vested
in the President.23 But its importance here lies in its interpreta-
tion of the first section of Article II. That language was read, with
extensive quotation from Hamilton and from Madison on the re-
moval power, as vesting all executive power in the President, the
subsequent language was read as merely particularizing some of
this power, and consequently the powers vested in Congress were
read as exceptions which must be strictly construed in favor of pow-
ers retained by the President.24 Myers remains the fountainhead of
the latitudinarian constructionists of presidential power, but its dicta,
with regard to the removal power, were first circumscribed in Hum-
phrey’s Executor v. United States,25 and then considerably altered
in Morrison v. Olson; 26 with regard to the President’s “inherent”
powers, the Myers dicta were called into considerable question by
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer.27
     The Curtiss-Wright Case.—Further Court support of the Hamiltonian
view was advanced in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,28
in which Justice Sutherland posited the doctrine that the power of the
National Government in foreign relations is not one of enumerated pow-
ers, but rather is inherent. The doctrine was then combined with Ham-
ilton’s contention that control of foreign relations is exclusively an ex-
ecutive function with obvious implications for the power of the President.
The case arose as a challenge to the delegation of power from Con-
gress to the President with regard to a foreign relations matter. Jus-
tice Sutherland denied that the limitations on delegation in the do-
mestic field were at all relevant in foreign affairs:

     24 Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 163–164 (1926). Professor Taft had held

different views. “The true view of the executive functions is, as I conceive it, that
the president can exercise no power which cannot be fairly and reasonably traced to
some specific grant of power or justly implied and included within such express grant
as proper and necessary in its exercise. Such specific grant must be either in the
federal constitution or in an act of Congress passed in pursuance thereof. There is
no undefined residuum of power which he can exercise because it seems to him to
be in the public interest. . . .” W. TAFT, OUR CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND HIS POWERS 139–
