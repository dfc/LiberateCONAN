the Senate passed a resolution of disapproval.697 With the decision
in INS v. Chadha,698 voiding as unconstitutional the one-House leg-
islative veto, it was evident that the veto provision in the deferral
section of the Impoundment Control Act was no longer viable. An
Administration effort to utilize the section, minus the veto device,
was thwarted by court action, in which, applying established sever-
ability analysis, the court held that Congress would not have en-
acted the deferral provision in the absence of power to police its
exercise through the veto.699 Thus, the entire deferral section was
inoperative. Congress, in 1987, enacted a more restricted authority,
limited to deferrals only for those purposes set out in the Anti-
Deficiency Act.700
    With passage of the Act, the constitutional issues faded into the
background; Presidents regularly reported rescission proposals, and
Congress responded by enacting its own rescissions, usually top-
ping the Presidents’. The entire field was, of course, confounded by
the application of the other part of the 1974 law, the Budget Act,
which restructured how budgets were received and acted on in Con-
gress, and by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985.701 This latter law was designed as a deficit-reduction
forcing mechanism, so that unless President and Congress cooper-
ate each year to reduce the deficit by prescribed amounts, a “seques-
tration” order would reduce funds down to a mandated figure.702
Dissatisfaction with the amount of deficit reduction continues to stimu-
late discussion of other means, such as “expedited” rescission and
the line-item veto, many of which may raise some constitutional is-
sues.

Power and Duty of the President in Relation to
  Subordinate Executive Officers
    If the law casts a duty upon a head of department eo nomine,
does the President thereupon become entitled by virtue of his duty
to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” to substitute
his own judgment for that of the principal officer regarding the dis-
     697 § 1013, 88 Stat. 334. Because the Act was a compromise between the House

of Representatives and the Senate, numerous questions were left unresolved; one
important one was whether the President could use the deferral avenue as a means
of effectuating policy impoundments or whether rescission proposals were the sole
means. The subsequent events described in the text mooted that argument.
