opinions make it difficult to evaluate the matter. During the Ko-
rean War, President Truman seized the steel industry, then in the
throes of a strike. No statute authorized the seizure, and the Solici-
tor General defended the action as an exercise of the President’s
executive powers that were conveyed by the first section of Article
II, by the obligation to enforce the laws, and by the vesting of the
function of commander-in-chief. By vote of six-to-three, the Court
rejected this argument and held the seizure void. But the doctrinal
problem is complicated by the fact that Congress had expressly re-
jected seizure proposals in considering labor legislation and had au-
thorized procedures not followed by the President that did not in-
clude seizure. Thus, four of the majority Justices 37 appear to have
been decisively influenced by the fact that Congress had denied the
power claimed and that this in an area in which the Constitution
vested the power to decide at least concurrently if not exclusively
in Congress. Three and perhaps four Justices 38 appear to have re-
jected the government’s argument on the merits while three 39 ac-
cepted it in large measure. Despite the inconclusiveness of the opin-
ions, it seems clear that the result was a substantial retreat from
the proclamation of vast presidential powers made in Myers and
Curtiss-Wright.40
     The Practice in the Presidential Office.—However con-
tested the theory of expansive presidential powers, the practice in
fact has been one of expansion of those powers, an expansion that
low v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982). Although perhaps somewhat latitudinarian
in some respect of the President’s powers, the analysis looks away from inherent
powers. But see Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), in which the statutory and con-
gressional ratification analyses is informed with a view of a range of presidential
foreign affairs discretion combined with judicial deference according the President
de facto much of the theoretically-based authority spelled out in Curtiss-Wright.
     36 343 U.S. 579 (1952). See Corwin, The Steel Seizure Case: A Judicial Brick

Without Straw, 53 COLUM. L. REV. 53 (1953). A case similar to Youngstown is AFL–
CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C. Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 443 U.S. 915 (1979),
which, on the basis of statutory interpretation of certain congressional delegations,
sustained a presidential order denying government contracts to companies that failed
to comply with certain voluntary wage and price guidelines.
     37 343 U.S. 593, 597–602 (Justice Frankfurter concurring, though he also noted

he expressly joined Justice Black’s opinion as well), 634, 635–40 (Justice Jackson
concurring), 655, 657 (Justice Burton concurring), 660 (Justice Clark concurring).
     38 343 U.S. at 582 (Justice Black delivering the opinion of the Court), 629 (Jus-

tice Douglas concurring, but note his use of the Fifth Amendment just compensa-
tion argument), 634 (Justice Jackson concurring), 655 (Justice Burton concurring).
     39 343 U.S. at 667 (Chief Justice Vinson and Justices Reed and Minton dissent-

ing).
     40 Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926); United States v. Curtiss-Wright

Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936). In Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 659–62, 668–69
(1981), the Court turned to Youngstown as embodying “much relevant analysis” on
an issue of presidential power. And, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 593 n.23
(2006), the Court cited Youngstown with approval, as did Justice Kennedy, in a con-
curring opinion joined by three other Justices, id. at 638.
