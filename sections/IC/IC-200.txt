The Clinton Impeachment
     President Clinton was impeached by the House, but acquitted
by vote of the Senate. The House approved two articles of impeach-
ment against the President stemming from the President’s re-
sponse to a sexual harassment civil lawsuit and to a subsequent
grand jury investigation instigated by an Independent Counsel. The
first article charged the President with committing perjury in testi-
fying before the grand jury about his sexual relationship with a White
House intern and his efforts to cover it up; 865 the second article
charged the President with obstruction of justice relating both to
the civil lawsuit and to the grand jury proceedings.866 Two addi-
tional articles of impeachment had been approved by the House Ju-
diciary Committee but were rejected by the full House.867 The Sen-
ate trial resulted in acquittal on both articles.868
     A number of legal issues surfaced during congressional consid-
eration of the Clinton impeachment.869 Although the congressional
     864 The grand jury had named the President as an unindicted coconspirator in

the case of United States v. Mitchell, et al., No. 74–110 (D.D.C. 1974), apparently in
the belief that he was not actually indictable while in office. The Supreme Court
agreed to hear the President’s claim that the grand jury acted outside its authority,
but finding that resolution of the issue was unnecessary to decision of the executive
privilege claim it dismissed as improvidently granted the President’s petition for cer-
tiorari. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 687 n.2 (1974).
     865 Approved by a vote of 228–206. 144 CONG. REC. H12,040 (daily ed. Dec. 19,

1998).
     866 Approved by a vote of 221–212. 144 CONG. REC. H12,041 (daily ed. Dec. 19,

1998).
     867 An article charging the President with perjury in the civil sexual harass-

ment suit brought against him was defeated by a vote of 229–205; another article
charging him with abuse of office by false responses to the House Judiciary Commit-
tee’s written request for factual admissions was defeated by vote of 285 to 148. 144
CONG. REC. H12,042 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 1998).
     868 The vote for acquittal was 55 to 45 on the grand jury perjury charge, and 50

to 50 on the obstruction of justice charge. 145 CONG. REC. S1458–59 (daily ed. Feb.
12, 1999).
