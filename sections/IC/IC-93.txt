Fifth Amendment against abrogation by Congress.416
    A regular staple of each Term’s docket of the Court is one or
two cases calling for an interpretation of the rights of Native Ameri-
cans under some treaty arrangement vis-a-vis the Federal Govern-
ment or the states. Thus, though no treaties have been negotiated
for decades and none presumably ever will again, litigation concern-
ing old treaties seemingly will go on.

      INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS WITHOUT SENATE
                      APPROVAL
    The capacity of the United States to enter into agreements with
other nations is not exhausted in the treaty-making power. The Con-
stitution recognizes a distinction between “treaties” and “agree-
ments” or “compacts” but does not indicate what the difference is.417
The differences, which once may have been clearer, have been seri-
ously blurred in practice within recent decades. Once a stepchild in
the family in which treaties were the preferred offspring, the execu-
tive agreement has surpassed in number and perhaps in interna-
tional influence the treaty formally signed, submitted for ratifica-
tion to the Senate, and proclaimed upon ratification.
     During the first half-century of its independence, the United States
was party to sixty treaties but to only twenty-seven published ex-
ecutive agreements. By the beginning of World War II, there had
been concluded approximately 800 treaties and 1,200 executive agree-
ments. In the period 1940–1989, the Nation entered into 759 trea-
ties and into 13,016 published executive agreements. Cumulatively,
in 1989, the United States was a party to 890 treaties and 5,117
executive agreements. To phrase it comparatively, in the first 50 years
of its history, the United States concluded twice as many treaties
as executive agreements. In the 50-year period from 1839 to 1889,
a few more executive agreements than treaties were entered into.
From 1889 to 1939, almost twice as many executive agreements as

total acreage violates Fifth Amendment’s taking clause by completely abrogating rights
