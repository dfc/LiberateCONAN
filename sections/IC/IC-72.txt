War, the Virginia legislature provided that the Commonwealth’s pa-
per money, which was depreciating rapidly, was to be legal cur-
rency for the payment of debts and to confound creditors who would
not accept the currency provided that Virginia citizens could pay
into the state treasury debts owed by them to subjects of Great Brit-
ain, which money was to be used to prosecute the war, and that
the auditor would give the debtor a certificate of payment which
would discharge the debtor of all future obligations to the credi-
tor.301 The Virginia scheme directly contradicted the assurances in
the peace treaty that no bars to collection by British creditors would
be raised, and in Ware v. Hylton 302 the Court struck down the state
law as violating the treaty that Article VI, paragraph 2, made supe-
rior. Justice Chase wrote: “A treaty cannot be the supreme law of
the land, that is, of all the United States, if any act of a state leg-
islature can stand in its way. If the constitution of a state . . . must
give way to a treaty, and fall before it; can it be questioned, whether
the less power, an act of the state legislature, must not be pros-
trate? It is the declared will of the people of the United States, that
every treaty made by the authority of the United States, shall be
superior to the constitution and laws of any individual state; and
their will alone is to decide.” 303
    In Hopkirk v. Bell,304 the Court further held that this same treaty
provision prevented the operation of a Virginia statute of limita-
tions to bar collection of antecedent debts. In numerous subse-
quent cases, the Court invariably ruled that treaty provisions su-
perseded inconsistent state laws governing the right of aliens to inherit
real estate.305 An example is Hauenstein v. Lynham,306 in which the
Court upheld the right of a citizen of the Swiss Republic, under

International Monetary Fund (Bretton Woods) Agreement of 1945, to which the United
States and Yugoslavia were parties, and an Agreement of 1948 between these two
nations, coupled with continued American observance of an 1881 treaty granting re-
ciprocal rights of inheritance to Yugoslavian and American nations, were held to pre-
clude Oregon from denying Yugoslavian aliens their treaty rights because of a fear
that Yugoslavian currency laws implementing such Agreements prevented American
nationals from withdrawing the proceeds from the sale of property inherited in the
latter country.
