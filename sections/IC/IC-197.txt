which Judge Pickering was impeached and convicted focused on al-
legations of mishandling a case before him and appearing on the
bench in an intemperate and intoxicated state.849 Both Judge Archbald
and Judge Ritter were convicted on articles of impeachment that
charged questionable conduct probably not amounting to indictable
offenses.850
    Of the three most recent judicial impeachments, Judges Claiborne
and Nixon had previously been convicted of criminal offenses, and
Judge Hastings had been acquitted of criminal charges after trial.
The impeachment articles against Judge Hastings charged both the
conduct for which he had been indicted and trial conduct. A sepa-
rate question was what effect the court acquittal should have had.851
    Although the language of the Constitution makes no such dis-
tinction, some argue that, because of the different nature of their
responsibilities and because of different tenure, different standards
should govern impeachment of judges and impeachment of execu-
tive officers.852

The Johnson Impeachment
    President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House on the
ground that he had violated the “Tenure of Office” Act 853 by dismiss-
ing a Cabinet chief. The theory of the proponents of impeachment
was succinctly put by Representative Butler, one of the managers
of the impeachment in the Senate trial. “An impeachable high crime
or misdemeanor is one in its nature or consequences subversive of
O. Douglas in 1970). For a critique of these views, see Paul S. Fenton, The Scope of
the Impeachment Power, 65 NW. U. L. REV.719 (1970), reprinted in Staff of the House
Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., Impeachment: Selected Materials 1801–03
(Comm. Print. 1998).

23 MINN. L. REV. 185 (1939). Judge Ritter was acquitted on six of the seven articles
brought against him, but convicted on a seventh charge that summarized the first
six articles and charged that the consequence of that conduct was “to bring his court
into scandal and disrepute, to the prejudice of said court and public confidence in
the Federal judiciary, and to render him unfit to continue to serve as such judge.”
This seventh charge was challenged unsuccessfully on a point of order, but was ruled
to be a separate charge of “general misbehavior.”

Judges Ritter and Claiborne were convicted on charges of income tax evasion, while
the House Judiciary Committee voted not to press such charges against President
Nixon. So too, the convictions of Judges Hastings and Nixon on perjury charges may
be contrasted with President Clinton’s acquittal on a perjury charge.
