not congressional authorization but a United Nations Security Coun-
cil resolution authorizing the use of force by member Nations. Only
at the last moment did the President seek authorization from Con-
gress, he and his officials contending that he had the power to act
unilaterally.180 After intensive debate, Congress voted, 250 to 183
in the House of Representatives and 53 to 46 in the Senate, to au-
thorize the President to use United States troops pursuant to the
U.N. resolution and purporting to bring the act within the context
of the War Powers Resolution.181
    By contrast, President George W. Bush sought a resolution from
Congress in 2002 to approve the eventual invasion of Iraq before
seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution, all the while denying
that express authorization from Congress, or for that matter, the
U.N. Security Council, was necessary to renew hostilities in Iraq.
Prior to adjourning for its midterm elections, Congress passed the
Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of
2002,182 which it styled as “specific statutory authorization within
the meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.” On sign-
ing the measure, the President noted that he had sought “an addi-
tional resolution of support” from Congress, and expressed appre-
ciation for receiving that support, but stated, “my request for it did
not, and my signing this resolution does not, constitute any change
in the long-standing positions of the executive branch on either the
President’s constitutional authority to use force to deter, prevent,
or respond to aggression or other threats to U.S. interests or on
the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.” 183 In the Bush
administration’s view, the primary benefit of receiving authoriza-
tion from Congress seems to have been the message of political unity
it conveyed to the rest of the world rather than the fulfillment of
any constitutional requirements.
    Although there is recurrent talk within Congress and without
as to amending the War Powers Resolution to strengthen it, no con-

the Congress” before attacking Iraq). On the day following his request for support-
ing legislation from Congress, President Bush, in answer to a question about the
requested action, stated: “I don’t think I need it. . . . I feel that I have the author-
