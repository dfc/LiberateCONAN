     Financial Disclosure and Limitations.—The Ethics in Gov-
ernment Act of 1978 540 requires high-level federal personnel to make
detailed, annual disclosures of their personal financial affairs.541 The
aims of the legislation are to enhance public confidence in govern-

ployees, to deter and detect conflicts of interest, to discourage indi-
viduals with questionable sources of income from entering government,
and to facilitate public appraisal of government employees’ perfor-

breadth of disclosures, to date judicial challenges have been unsuc-

this prohibition, even interpreted in accordance with the standards
applicable to speech restrictions on government employees, was over-

one comprehensive title, as amended, applying to all covered federal personnel was
enacted. 5 U.S.C. App. §§ 101–111.
