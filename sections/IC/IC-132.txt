been settled,580 although it appears likely that the controversies with
respect to congressional-presidential assertions of power in execu-
tive agency matters are only beginning.
     Inferior Officers.—In the case of inferior officers, Congress may
“limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the
public interest,” 581 and when Congress has vested the power to ap-
point these officers in heads of departments, it is ordinarily the de-
partment head, rather than the President, who enjoys the power of
removal. However, in the case of Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com-
pany Accounting Oversight Bd.,582 the Court considered whether an
inferior officer can be twice insulated from the President’s removal
authority—in other words, can a principal officer whom Congress
has protected from at will removal by the President in turn have
his or her power to remove an inferior officer restricted? 583 The Court
held that such multilevel protection from removal is contrary to the
President’s executive authority. First, even if the President deter-
mines that the inferior officer is neglecting his duties or discharg-
ing them improperly, the President does not have the power to re-
move that officer. Then, if the President seeks to have the principal
officer remove the inferior officer, the principal officer may not agree
with the President’s determination, and the President generally can-
not remove the principal officer simply because of this disagree-
ment.584
    In the absence of specific legislative provision to the contrary,
the President may at his discretion remove an inferior officer whose
term is limited by statute,585 or one appointed with the consent of
the Senate.586 He may remove an officer of the army or navy at
any time by nominating to the Senate the officer’s successor, pro-

independent agencies to the prosecutorial powers wielded by the independent coun-

     583 The case involved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a pri-

vate non-profit entity with a five-member board, that has significant authority over
accounting firms that participate in auditing public companies. The board members
are appointed to staggered 5-year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, and can only be removed for “good cause shown,” which requires a finding of
either a violation of securities laws or board rules, willful abuse of power, or failure
to enforce compliance with the rules governing registered public accounting firms.

moved by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.
