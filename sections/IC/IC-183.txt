in that Congress had laid down specific procedures for the Presi-
dent to follow, which he had declined to follow.779
    Despite the opinion of the Court, therefore, it seems clear that
four of the six Justices in the majority were more moved by the
fact that the President had acted in a manner considered and re-
jected by Congress in a field in which Congress was empowered to
establish the rules—rules the President is to see faithfully executed—
than with the fact that the President’s action was a form of “law-
making” in a field committed to the province of Congress. The opin-
ion of the Court, therefore, and its doctrinal implications must be
considered with care, as it is doubtful that the opinion lays down a
constitutional rule. Whatever the implications of the opinions of the
individual Justices for the doctrine of “inherent” presidential powers—
and they are significant—the implications for the area here under
consideration are cloudy and have remained so from the time of the
decision.780

          PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FROM JUDICIAL
                       DIRECTION
    In Mississippi v. Johnson,781 in 1867, the Court placed the Presi-
dent beyond the reach of judicial direction, either affirmative or re-
straining, in the exercise of his powers, whether constitutional or
statutory, political or otherwise, save perhaps for what must be a
small class of powers that are purely ministerial.782 An application
for an injunction to forbid President Johnson to enforce the Recon-
struction Acts, on the ground of their unconstitutionality, was an-
swered by Attorney General Stanberg, who argued, inter alia, the
absolute immunity of the President from judicial process.783 The Court
refused to permit the filing, using language construable as mean-
    779  343 U.S. at 662, 663.
    780  In Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 668–69 (1981), the Court re-
curred to the Youngstown analysis for resolution of the presented questions, but one
must observe that it did so saying that “the parties and the lower courts . . . have
all agreed that much relevant analysis is contained in” Youngstown. See also id. at
661–62, quoting Justice Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence, “which both parties agree
brings together as much combination of analysis and common sense as there is in
this area.”
     781 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475 (1867).
     782 The Court declined to express an opinion “whether, in any case, the Presi-

dent of the United States may be required, by the process of this court, to perform a
purely ministerial act under a positive law, or may be held amenable, in any case,
otherwise than by impeachment for crime.” 71 U.S. at 498. See Franklin v. Massa-
chusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 825–28 (1992) (Justice Scalia concurring). In NTEU v. Nixon,
492 F.2d 587 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the court held that a writ of mandamus could issue to
compel the President to perform a ministerial act, although it said that if any other
officer were available to whom the writ could run it should be applied to him.

counsel).
