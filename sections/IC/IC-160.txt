personae.” He was also of opinion that expenditures from the “se-
cret service” fund, in order to be valid, must be vouched for by the
President personally.677 On like grounds the Supreme Court once
held void a decree of a court martial, because, though it has been
confirmed by the Secretary of War, it was not specifically stated to
have received the sanction of the President as required by the 65th
Article of War.678 This case has, however, been virtually overruled,
and at any rate such cases are exceptional.679
     The general rule, as stated by the Court, is that when any duty
is cast by law upon the President, it may be exercised by him through
the head of the appropriate department, whose acts, if performed
within the law, thus become the President’s acts.680 Williams v. United
States 681 involved an act of Congress that prohibited the advance
of public money in any case whatever to disbursing officers of the
United States, except under special direction by the President.682
The Supreme Court held that the act did not require the personal
performance by the President of this duty. Such a practice, said the
Court, if it were possible, would absorb the duties of the various
departments of the government in the personal acts of one chief
executive officer, and be fraught with mischief to the public service.
The President’s duty in general requires his superintendence of the
administration; yet he cannot be required to become the adminis-
trative officer of every department and bureau, or to perform in per-
son the numerous details incident to services which, nevertheless,
he is, in a correct sense, by the Constitution and laws required and
expected to perform.683 As a matter of administrative practice, in
fact, most orders and instructions emanating from the heads of the

      679 Cf. In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 670–671 (1897), where it was held that

presumptions in favor of official action “preclude collateral attack on the sentences
of courts-martial.” See also United States v. Fletcher, 148 U.S. 84, 88–89 (1893);
Bishop v. United States, 197 U.S. 334, 341–42 (1905), both of which in effect repudi-
ate Runkle.
      680 The President, in the exercise of his executive power under the Constitu-

tion, “speaks and acts through the heads of the several departments in relation to
subjects which appertain to their respective duties.” The heads of the departments
are his authorized assistants in the performance of his executive duties, and their
official acts, promulgated in the regular course of business, are presumptively his
acts. Wilcox v. McConnel, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 498, 513 (1839). See also United States
