Impoundment of Appropriated Funds
     In his Third Annual Message to Congress, President Jefferson
established the first faint outline of what years later became a ma-
jor controversy. Reporting that $50,000 in funds which Congress had
appropriated for fifteen gunboats on the Mississippi remained
unexpended, the President stated that a “favorable and peaceful turn
of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of the
law unnecessary. . . .” But he was not refusing to expend the money,
only delaying action to obtain improved gunboats; a year later, he
told Congress that the money was being spent and gunboats were
being obtained.685 A few other instances of deferrals or refusals to
spend occurred in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries,
but it was only with the Administration of President Franklin
Roosevelt that a President refused to spend moneys for the pur-
poses appropriated. Succeeding Presidents expanded upon these prec-
edents, and in the Nixon Administration a well-formulated plan of
impoundments was executed in order to reduce public spending and
to negate programs established by congressional legislation.686
    Impoundment 687 was defended by Administration spokesmen as
being a power derived from the President’s executive powers and
particularly from his obligation to see to the faithful execution of
     684 38 Ops. Atty. Gen. 457, 458 (1936). And, of course, if the President exercises

his duty through subordinates, he must appoint them or appoint the officers who
appoint them, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109–143 (1976), and he must have the
power to discharge those officers in the Executive Branch, Myers v. United States,
272 U.S. 52 (1926), although the Court has now greatly qualified Myers to permit
congressional limits on the removal of some officers. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S.
654 (1988).

     686 History and law is much discussed in Executive Impoundment of Appropri-

ated Funds: Hearings Before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Separation of
Powers, 92d Congress, 1st Sess. (1971); Impoundment of Appropriated Funds by the
President: Hearings Before the Senate Government Operations Ad Hoc Subcommittee
on Impoundment of Funds, 93d Congress, 1st Sess. (1973). The most thorough study
of the legal and constitutional issues, informed through historical analysis, is Abas-
cal & Kramer, Presidential Impoundment Part I: Historical Genesis and Constitu-
tional Framework, 62 GEO. L. J. 1549 (1974); Abascal & Kramer, Presidential Im-
poundment Part II: Judicial and Legislative Response, 63, id. at 149 (1974). See generally

     687 There is no satisfactory definition of impoundment. Legislation enacted by

Congress uses the phrase “deferral of budget authority” which is defined to include:
“(A) withholding or delaying the obligation or expenditure of budget authority (whether
by establishing reserves or otherwise) provided for projects or activities; or (B) any
other type of Executive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obligation
or expenditure of budget authority, including authority to obligate by contract in
advance of appropriations as specifically authorized by law.” 2 U.S.C. § 682(1).
