    Controversy over Holmes’ language apparently led Justice Black
in Reid v. Covert 364 to deny that the difference in language of the
Supremacy Clause with regard to statutes and with regard to trea-
ties was relevant to the status of treaties as inferior to the Consti-
tution. “There is nothing in this language which intimates that trea-
ties do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the draft-
ing and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a
result. These debates as well as the history that surrounds the adop-
tion of the treaty provision in Article VI make it clear that the rea-
son treaties were not limited to those made in ‘pursuance’ of the
Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States
under the Articles of Confederation, including the important trea-
ties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in ef-
fect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who
created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for
the Bill of Rights—let alone alien to our entire constitutional his-
tory and tradition—to construe Article VI as permitting the United
States to exercise power under an international agreement without
observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would
permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned
by Article V.” 365
    Establishment of the general principle, however, is but the be-
ginning; there is no readily agreed-upon standard for determining
what the limitations are. The most persistently urged proposition
in limitation has been that the treaty power must not invade the
reserved powers of the states. In view of the sweeping language of
the Supremacy Clause, it is hardly surprising that this argument
has not prevailed.366 Nevertheless, the issue, in the context of Con-
gress’s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to effectuate
a treaty dealing with a subject arguably within the domain of the
    364  354 U.S. 1 (1957) (plurality opinion).
    365  354 U.S. at 16–17. For discussions of the issue, see Restatement, Foreign
Relations, § 302; Nowak & Rotunda, A Comment on the Creation and Resolution of
a “Non-Problem”: Dames & Moore v. Regan, the Foreign Affairs Power, and the Role

     366 Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796); Fairfax’s Devisee v. Hunter’s Les-

see, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 603 (1813); Chirac v. Chirac, 15 U.S. (2 Wheat.) 259 (1817);
Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483 (1880). Jefferson, in his list of exceptions to
the treaty power, thought the Constitution “must have meant to except out of these
the rights reserved to the States, for surely the President and Senate cannot do by
treaty what the whole Government is interdicted from doing in any way.” Jeffer-
son’s Manual of Parliamentary Practice, § 594, reprinted in THE RULES AND MANUAL OF
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, H. Doc. 102–405, 102d Congress, 2d Sess. (1993), 298–
299. But this view has always been the minority one. Q. Wright, supra, at 92 n.97.
The nearest the Court ever came to supporting this argument appears to be Frederickson
v. Louisiana, 64 U.S. (23 How.) 445, 448 (1860).
