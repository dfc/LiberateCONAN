     The Loyalty Issue.—By section 9A of the Hatch Act of 1939, a
federal employee was disqualified from accepting or holding any po-
sition in the Federal Government or the District of Columbia if he
belonged to an organization that he knew advocated the overthrow
of our constitutional form of government.534 The 79th Congress fol-
lowed up this provision with a rider to its appropriation acts forbid-
ding the use of any appropriated funds to pay the salary of any
person who advocated, or belonged to an organization which advo-
cated the overthrow of the government by force, or of any person
who engaged in a strike or who belonged to an organization which
asserted the right to strike against the government.535 These provi-
sos ultimately wound up in permanent law requiring all govern-
ment employees to take oaths disclaiming either disloyalty or strikes
as a device for dealing with the government as an employer.536 Along
with the loyalty-security programs initiated by President Tru-
man 537 and carried forward by President Eisenhower,538 these mea-
sures reflected the Cold War era and the fear of subversion and es-
pionage following the disclosures of several such instances here and
abroad.539
