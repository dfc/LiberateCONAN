    In the face of the proposition that electors are state officers, the
Court has upheld the power of Congress to act to protect the integ-
rity of the process by which they are chosen.89 But, in Ray v. Blair,90
the Court reasserted the conception of electors as state officers, with
some significant consequences.

Electors as Free Agents
     “No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan origi-
nally contemplated, what is implicit in its text, that electors would
be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judg-
ment as to the men best qualified for the Nation’s highest of-
fices.” 91 Writing in 1826, Senator Thomas Hart Benton admitted
that the framers had intended electors to be men of “superior dis-
cernment, virtue, and information,” who would select the President
“according to their own will” and without reference to the immedi-
ate wishes of the people. “That this invention has failed of its objec-
tive in every election is a fact of such universal notoriety, that no
one can dispute it. That it ought to have failed is equally uncontest-
able; for such independence in the electors was wholly incompat-
ible with the safety of the people. [It] was, in fact, a chimerical and
impractical idea in any community.” 92
    Electors constitutionally remain free to cast their ballots for any
person they wish and occasionally they have done so.93 In 1968, for
example, a Republican elector in North Carolina chose to cast his
vote not for Richard M. Nixon, who had won a plurality in the state,
but for George Wallace, the independent candidate who had won
the second greatest number of votes. Members of both the House of
Representatives and of the Senate objected to counting that vote
for Mr. Wallace and insisted that it should be counted for Mr. Nixon,
but both bodies decided to count the vote as cast.94
