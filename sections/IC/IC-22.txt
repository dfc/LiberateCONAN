tricts rather than statewide, the Court described the variety of per-
missible methods. “Therefore, on reference to contemporaneous and
subsequent action under the clause, we should expect to find, as
we do, that various modes of choosing the electors were pursued,
as, by the legislature itself on joint ballot; by the legislature through
a concurrent vote of the two houses; by vote of the people for a gen-
eral ticket; by vote of the people in districts; by choice partly by
the people voting in districts and partly by the legislature; by choice
by the legislature from candidates voted for by the people in dis-
tricts; and in other ways, as, notably, by North Carolina in 1792,
and Tennessee in 1796 and 1800. No question was raised as to the
power of the State to appoint, in any mode its legislature saw fit to
adopt, and none that a single method, applicable without excep-
tion, must be pursued in the absence of an amendment to the Con-
stitution. The district system was largely considered the most equi-
table, and Madison wrote that it was that system which was
contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, although it was
soon seen that its adoption by some States might place them at a
disadvantage by a division of their strength, and that a uniform
rule was preferable.” 72

State Discretion in Choosing Electors
    Although Clause 2 seemingly vests complete discretion in the
states, certain older cases had recognized a federal interest in pro-
tecting the integrity of the process. Thus, the Court upheld the power
of Congress to protect the right of all citizens who are entitled to
vote to lend aid and support in any legal manner to the election of
any legally qualified person as a presidential elector.73 Its power to
protect the choice of electors from fraud or corruption was sus-
tained.74 “If this government is anything more than a mere aggre-
gation of delegated agents of other States and governments, each
of which is superior to the general government, it must have the
power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from
violence and corruption. If it has not this power it is helpless be-
fore the two great natural and historical enemies of all republics,
open violence and insidious corruption.” 75
    More recently, substantial curbs on state discretion have been
instituted by both the Court and the Congress. In Williams v. Rhodes,76
the Court struck down a complex state system that effectively lim-
   72 146 U.S. at 28–29.
   73 Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884).
   74 Burroughs & Cannon v. United States, 290 U.S. 534 (1934).
   75 Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 657–58 (1884) (quoted in Burroughs and

Cannon v. United States, 290 U.S. 534, 546 (1934)).
   76 393 U.S. 23 (1968).
