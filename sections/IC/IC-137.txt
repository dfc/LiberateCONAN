     Prosecutorial and Grand Jury Access to Presidential Docu-
ments.—Rarely will there be situations when federal prosecutors
or grand juries seek information under the control of the Presi-
dent, since he has ultimate direction of federal prosecuting agen-
cies, but the Watergate Special Prosecutor, being in a unique legal
situation, was held able to take the President to court to enforce
subpoenas for tape recordings of presidential conversations and other
documents relating to the commission of criminal actions.602 While
holding that the subpoenas were valid and should be obeyed, the
Supreme Court recognized the constitutional status of executive privi-
lege, insofar as the assertion of that privilege relates to presiden-
tial conversations and indirectly to other areas as well.
     Presidential communications, the Court said, have “a presump-
tive privilege.” “The privilege is fundamental to the operation of gov-
ernment and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under
the Constitution.” The operation of government is furthered by the
protection accorded communications between high government offi-
cials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of
their duties. “A President and those who assist him must be free to
explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making
decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to ex-
press except privately.” The separation of powers basis derives from
the conferral upon each of the branches of the Federal Government
of powers to be exercised by each of them in great measure indepen-
dent of the other branches. The confidentiality of presidential con-
versations flows then from the effectuation of enumerated pow-
ers.603
     However, the Court continued, the privilege is not absolute. The
federal courts have the power to construe and delineate claims aris-
ing under express and implied powers. Deference is owed the con-
stitutional decisions of the other branches, but it is the function of
the courts to exercise the judicial power, “to say what the law is.”
The Judicial Branch has the obligation to do justice in criminal pros-
ecutions, which involves the employment of an adversary system of
criminal justice in which all the probative facts, save those clearly

the federal courts to preserve the confidentiality of judicial deliberations, cf. New
York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 752 n.3 (1971) (Chief Justice Burger
dissenting), and in each house of Congress to treat many of its papers and docu-
ments as privileged. Cf. Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1080, 1081–1982 (C.A.D.C.

2d Sess. (1962), 512 (Senator Stennis). See Calley v. Callaway, 519 F.2d 184 (5th
Cir. 1975) (en banc), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 911 (1976); United States v. Ehrlichman,
389 F. Supp. 95 (D.D.C. 1974).
