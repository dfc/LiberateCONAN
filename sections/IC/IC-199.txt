ciary Committee, charging obstruction of the investigation of the
“Watergate” burglary inquiry, misuse of law enforcement and intel-
ligence agencies for political purposes, and refusal to comply with
the Judiciary Committee’s subpoenas.859 Following President Nixon’s
resignation, the House adopted a resolution to “accept” the House
Judiciary Committee’s report recommending impeachment,860 but there
was no vote adopting the articles and thereby impeaching the for-
mer President, and consequently there was no Senate trial.
     In the course of the proceedings, there was strenuous argu-
ment about the nature of an impeachable offense, whether only
criminally-indictable actions qualify for that status or whether the
definition is broader.861 The three articles approved by the Judi-
ciary Committee were all premised on abuse of power, although the
first article, involving obstruction of justice, also involved a crimi-
nal violation.862 A second issue arose that apparently had not been
considered before: whether persons subject to impeachment could
be indicted and tried prior to impeachment and conviction or whether
indictment could occur only after removal from office. In fact, the
argument was really directed only to the status of the President,
as it was argued that he embodied the Executive Branch itself, while
lesser executive officials and judges were not of that calibre.863 That

     862 Indeed, the Committee voted not to recommend impeachment for alleged in-

come tax fraud, an essentially private crime not amounting to an abuse of power.
     863 The question first arose during the grand jury investigation of former Vice

President Agnew, during which the United States, through the Solicitor General,
argued that the Vice President and all civil officers were not immune from the judi-
cial process and could be indicted prior to removal, but that the President for a num-
ber of constitutional and practical reasons was not subject to the ordinary criminal
process. Memorandum for the United States, Application of Spiro T. Agnew, Civil
No. 73–965 (D.Md., filed October 5, 1973). Courts have held that a federal judge
was indictable and could be convicted prior to removal from office. United States v.
