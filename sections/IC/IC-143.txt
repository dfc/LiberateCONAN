significant weight on the use of the definite article “the” in the Re-
cess Appointments Clause. He further concluded that, if recess ap-
pointments were allowed during periods other than an intersession
recess, nothing would prevent an appointment from being made “dur-
ing any adjournment, as from Thursday or Friday until the follow-
ing Monday.” This position was abandoned in 1921 in an opinion
issued by Attorney General Daugherty that declared that an appoint-
ment made during a 29-day recess was constitutional. Daugherty’s
opinion focused on the practical aspects of the recess appointment
dynamic, stating that, “[i]f the President’s power of appointment is
to be defeated because the Senate takes an adjournment to a speci-
fied date, the painful and inevitable result will be measurably to
prevent the exercise of governmental functions.” 617 Further empha-
sizing this functional approach, Daugherty’s opinion rejected the no-
tion that this broader interpretation would authorize intrasession
appointments during brief adjournments, declaring that “an adjourn-
ment for 5 or even 10 days can [not] be said to constitute the re-
cess intended by the Constitution.” 618 The opinion concluded by em-
phasizing that, although “[e]very presumption is to be indulged in
favor of the validity of whatever action [the President] may take
. . . , there is a point, necessarily hard of definition, where pal-
pable abuse of discretion might subject his appointment to re-
view.” 619 Subsequent Attorney General and Department of Justice
Office of Legal Counsel opinions have continued to support the con-
stitutionality of intrasession recess appointments, with more re-
cent pronouncements on the issue asserting that the clause encom-
passes all recesses in excess of three days.620
    Thus, a Senate “recess” does not include holidays, or very brief
temporary adjournments,621 while, by an act of Congress, if the va-
cancy existed when the Senate was in session, the ad interim ap-
pointee, subject to certain exceptions, may receive no salary until

cess” must be to be actually a recess, a question here as in the pocket veto area, is
uncertain. 3 O. L. C. 311, 314 (1979). A “recess,” however, may be merely “construc-
tive,” as when a regular session succeeds immediately upon a special session. It was
this kind of situation that gave rise to the once famous Crum incident. See 3 W.
Willoughby, supra, at 1508–1509.
