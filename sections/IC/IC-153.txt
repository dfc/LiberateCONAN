is the body that lays and collects taxes for the common defense,
that creates armies and maintains navies, although it does not di-
rect them, that pledges the public credit, that declares war, that
defines offenses against the law of nations, that regulates foreign
commerce; and it has the further power “to make all laws which
shall be necessary and proper”—that is, which it deems to be such—
for carrying into execution not only its own powers but all the pow-
ers “of the government of the United States and of any department
or officer thereof.” Moreover, its laws made “in pursuance” of these
powers are “supreme law of the land,” and the President is bound
constitutionally to “take Care that” they “be faithfully executed.”
In point of fact, congressional legislation has operated to augment
presidential powers in the foreign field much more frequently than
it has to curtail them. The Lend-Lease Act of March 11, 1941 650 is
the classic example, although it only brought to culmination a whole
series of enactments with which Congress had aided and abetted
the administration’s foreign policy in the years between 1934 and
1941.651 Disillusionment with presidential policies in the context of
the Vietnamese conflict led Congress to legislate restrictions, not
only with respect to the discretion of the President to use troops
abroad in the absence of a declaration of war, but also limiting his
economic and political powers through curbs on his authority to de-
clare national emergencies.652 The lesson of history, however, ap-
pears to be that congressional efforts to regain what is deemed to
have been lost to the President are intermittent, whereas the presi-
dential exercise of power in today’s world is unremitting.653
