the periods of notice provided for in such treaties,” and the re-
quired notice was given.385 When, however, by section 34 of the Jones
Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the same President was authorized
and directed within ninety days to give notice to the other parties
to certain treaties, with which the Act was not in conflict but which
might restrict Congress in the future from enacting discriminatory
tonnage duties, President Wilson refused to comply, asserting that
he “did not deem the direction contained in section 34 . . . an exer-
cise of any constitutional power possessed by Congress.” 386 The same
attitude toward section 34 was continued by Presidents Harding and
Coolidge.387
    Very few precedents exist in which the President terminated a
treaty after obtaining the approval of the Senate alone. The first
occurred in 1854–1855, when President Pierce requested and re-
ceived Senate approval to terminate a treaty with Denmark.388 When
the validity of this action was questioned in the Senate, the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations reported that the procedure was cor-
rect, that prior full-Congress actions were incorrect, and that the
right to terminate resides in the treaty-making authorities, the Presi-
dent and the Senate.389
    Examples of treaty terminations in which the President acted
alone are much disputed with respect both to facts and to the un-

President to abrogate a treaty with China, but President Hayes vetoed it, partly on
the ground that Congress as an entity had no role to play in ending treaties, only
the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 9 J. Richardson, supra, at

     387 Since this time, very few instances appear in which Congress has requested

or directed termination by notice, but they have resulted in compliance. E.g., 65 Stat.
72 (1951) (directing termination of most-favored-nation provisions with certain Com-
munist countries in commercial treaties); 70 Stat. 773 (1956) (requesting renuncia-
tion of treaty rights of extraterritoriality in Morroco). The most recent example ap-
pears to be § 313 of the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which required the Secretary of
State to terminate immediately, in accordance with its terms, the tax treaty and
protocol with South Africa that had been concluded on December 13, 1946. Pub. L.

national Sanitary Convention of 1903. See 61 CONG. REC. 1793–1794 (1921). See CRS
