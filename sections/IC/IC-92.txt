with foreign nations,406 that the states were incompetent to inter-
fere with rights created by such treaties,407 that as long as the United
States recognized the national character of a tribe, its members were
under the protection of treaties and of the laws of Congress and
their property immune from taxation by a state,408 that a stipula-
tion in an Indian treaty that laws forbidding the introduction, of
liquors into Indian territory was operative without legislation, and
binding on the courts although the territory was within an orga-
nized county of a state,409 and that an act of Congress contrary to
a prior Indian treaty repealed it.410
    Present Status of Indian Treaties.—Today, the subject of In-
dian treaties is a closed account in the constitutional law ledger.
By a rider inserted in the Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1871,
it was provided “That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within
the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recog-
nized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United
States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, that nothing herein
contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation
of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such
Indian nation or tribe.” 411 Subsequently, the power of Congress to
withdraw or modify tribal rights previously granted by treaty has
been invariably upheld.412 Statutes modifying rights of members in
tribal lands,413 granting a right of way for a railroad through lands
ceded by treaty to an Indian tribe,414 or extending the application
of revenue laws respecting liquor and tobacco over Indian territo-
ries, despite an earlier treaty exemption,415 have been sustained.
    When, on the other hand, definite property rights have been con-
ferred upon individual Native Americans, whether by treaty or un-
der an act of Congress, they are protected by the Constitution to
the same extent and in the same way as the private rights of other
residents or citizens of the United States. Hence, the Court held
