ate, . . . from requesting, giving to, or receiving from, any other officer
or employee of the Government, any money or property or other
thing of value for political purposes.” 526 The validity of this mea-
sure having been sustained,527 the substance of it, with some elabo-
rations, was incorporated in the Civil Service Act of 1883.528 The
Lloyd-La Follette Act in 1912 began the process of protecting civil
servants from unwarranted or abusive removal by codifying “just
cause” standards previously embodied in presidential orders, defin-
ing “just causes” as those that would promote the “efficiency of the
service.” 529 Substantial changes in the civil service system were in-
stituted by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which abolished
the Civil Service Commission and delegated its responsibilities, its
management, and its administrative duties to the Office of Person-
nel Management and its review and protective functions to the Merit
Systems Protection Board.530
    Until 1993, § 9(a) of the Hatch Act 531 prohibited any person in
the executive branch, or any executive branch department or agency,
except the President and the Vice President and certain “policy de-
termining” officers, to “take an active part in political management
or political campaigns,” although employees had been permitted to
“express their opinions on all political subjects and candidates.” In
United Public Workers v. Mitchell,532 these provisions were upheld
as “reasonable” against objections based on the First, Fifth, Ninth,
and Tenth Amendments. The Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993,

    527  Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. 371 (1882). Chief Justice Waite’s opinion exten-
sively reviews early congressional legislation regulative of conduct in office. Id. at

     528 22 Stat. 403 (the Pendleton Act). On this law and subsequent enactments

that created the civil service as a professional cadre of bureaucrats insulated from
politics, see Developments in the Law: Public Employment, 97 HARV. L. REV. 1611,

     529 Act of Aug. 24, 1912, § 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555, codified as amended at 5 U.S.C.

§ 7513. The protection was circumscribed by the limited enforcement mechanisms
under the Civil Service Commission, which were gradually strengthened. See Devel-
opments, supra, 97 HARV. L. REV., 1630–31.
     530 92 Stat. 1111 (codified in scattered sections of titles 5, 10, 15, 28, 31, 38, 39,

     531 53 Stat. 1147, 1148 (1939), then 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a). The 1940 law, § 12(a), 54

Stat. 767–768, applied the same broad ban to employees of federally funded state
and local agencies, but this provision was amended in 1974 to restrict state and
local government employees in only one respect: running for public office in partisan
elections. Act of Oct. 15, 1974, Pub. L. 93–443, § 401(a), 88 Stat. 1290, 5 U.S.C. § 1502.

Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), in which the constitutional attack was renewed, in
large part based on the Court’s expanding free speech jurisprudence, but the act
was again sustained. A “little Hatch Act” of a state, applying to its employees, was
sustained in Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973).
