tion, the litigation involved, of course, the claim of confidentiality
of conversations between the President and his aides.
    Private Access to Government Information.—Private par-
ties may seek to obtain information from the government either to
assist in defense to criminal charges brought by the government or
in civil cases to use in either a plaintiff ’s or defendant’s capacity in
suits with the government or between private parties.594 In crimi-
nal cases, a defendant is guaranteed compulsory process to obtain
witnesses by the Sixth Amendment and by the due process clause
is guaranteed access to relevant exculpatory information in the pos-
session of the prosecution.595 Generally speaking, when the prosecu-
tion is confronted with a judicial order to turn over to a defendant
information that it does not wish to make available, the prosecu-
tion has the option of dropping the prosecution and thus avoiding
disclosure.596 But that alternative may not always be available; in
the Watergate prosecution, only by revoking the authority of the
Special Prosecutor and bringing the cases back into the confines of
the Department of Justice could this possibility have been real-
ized.597
    In civil cases the government may invoke the state secrets privi-
lege against revealing military or other secrets. In United States v.
Reynolds,598 a tort claim brought against the United States for com-
pensation for the deaths of civilians in the crash of an Air Force

I:18 passim. For a strong argument that the doctrine lacks any constitutional or
other legal basis, see R. BERGER, EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE: A CONSTITUTIONAL MYTH (1974).
The book, however, precedes the Court decision in Nixon.
     594 There are also, of course, instances of claimed access for other purposes, for

which the Freedom of Information Act, 80 Stat. 383 (1966), 5 U.S.C. § 552, provides
generally for public access to governmental documents. In 522(b), however, nine types
of information are exempted from coverage, several of which relate to the types as
to which executive privilege has been asserted, such as matter classified pursuant
to executive order, interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters, and law en-
forcement investigatory files. See, e.g., EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973); FTC v. Grolier,
Inc., 462 U.S. 19 (1983); CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159 (1985); John Doe Agency v. John
Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989); Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973),
cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974).
     595 See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Rule 16, Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure. The earliest judicial dispute involving what later became known
as executive privilege arose in United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30 and 187 (C.C.D.
Va. 1807), in which defendant sought certain exculpatory material from President
Jefferson. Dispute continues with regard to the extent of presidential compliance,
but it appears that the President was in substantial compliance with outstanding
orders if not in full compliance.
     596 E.g., Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1968).
     597 Thus, defendant in United States v. Ehrlichman, 376 F. Supp. 29 (D.D.C.

1974), was held entitled to access to material in the custody of the President wherein
the President’s decision to dismiss the prosecution would probably have been unavail-
ing.
