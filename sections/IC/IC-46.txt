ment in hostilities, is limited to instances of (1) a declaration of
war, (2) a specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emer-
gency created by an attack on the United States, its territories or
possessions, or its armed forces.174 In the absence of a declaration
of war, a President must within 48 hours report to Congress when-
ever he introduces troops (1) into hostilities or situations of immi-
nent hostilities, (2) into a foreign nation while equipped for com-
bat, except in certain nonhostile situations, or (3) in numbers which
substantially enlarge United States troops equipped for combat al-
ready located in a foreign nation.175 If the President introduces troops
in the first of these three situations, then he must terminate the
use of troops within 60 days after his report was submitted or was
required to be submitted to Congress, unless Congress (1) has de-
clared war, (2) has extended the period, or (3) is unable to meet as
a result of an attack on the United States, but the period can be
extended another 30 days by the President’s certification to Con-
gress of unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of the
troops.176 Congress may through the passage of a concurrent reso-
lution require the President to remove the troops sooner.177 The Reso-
lution further states that no legislation, whether enacted prior to
or subsequent to passage of the Resolution will be taken to em-
power the President to use troops abroad unless the legislation spe-
cifically does so and that no treaty may so empower the President
unless it is supplemented by implementing legislation specifically
addressed to the issue.178
    Aside from its use as a rhetorical device, the War Powers Reso-
lution has been of little worth in reordering presidential-
congressional relations in the years since its enactment. All Presi-
dents operating under it have expressly or implicitly considered it
to be an unconstitutional infringement on presidential powers, and
on each occasion of use abroad of United States troops the Presi-
dent in reporting to Congress has done so “consistent[ly] with” the
reporting section but not pursuant to the provision.179 Upon the in-
vasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops in 1990, President Bush sought
    174   87 Stat. 554, 2(c), 50 U.S.C. § 1541(c).
    175   50 U.S.C. § 1543(a).
      176 50 U.S.C. § 1544(b).
      177 Id. at § 1544(c). It is the general consensus that, following INS v. Chadha,

462 U.S. 919 (1983), this provision of the Resolution is unconstitutional.
      178 50 U.S.C. § 1547(a).
