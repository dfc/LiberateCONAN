any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation im-
port a contract—when either of the parties engages to perform a
particular act, the treaty addresses itself to the political, not the
judicial department; and the legislature must execute the contract,
before it can become a rule for the court.” 287
    To the same effect, but more accurate, is Justice Miller’s lan-
guage for the Court a half century later, in the Head Money Cases:
“A treaty is primarily a compact between independent nations. It
depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and
the honor of the governments which are parties of it. . . . But a
treaty may also contain provisions which confer certain rights upon
the citizens or subjects of one of the nations residing in the territo-
rial limits of the other, which partake of the nature of municipal
law, and which are capable of enforcement as between private par-
ties in the courts of the country.” 288
     The meaning of treaties, as of statutes, is determined by the
courts. “If treaties are to be given effect as federal law under our
legal system, determining their meaning as a matter of federal law
‘is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department,’
headed by the ‘one supreme Court’ established by the Constitu-
tion.” 289 Yet, “[w]hile courts interpret treaties for themselves, the
meaning given them by the departments of government particu-
larly charged with their negotiation and enforcement is given great
weight.” 290 Decisions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in-

     289 Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 353–54 (2006), quoting Marbury v.

Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137, 177 (1803). In Sanchez-Llamas, two foreign nationals
were arrested in the United States, and, in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations, their nations’ consuls were not notified that they
had been detained by authorities in a foreign country (the U.S.). The foreign nation-
als were convicted in Oregon and Virginia state courts, respectively, and cited the
violations of Article 36 in challenging their convictions. The Court did not decide
whether Article 36 grants rights that may be invoked by individuals in a judicial
proceeding (four justices would have held that it did grant such rights). The reason
that the Court did not decide whether Article 36 grants rights to defendants was
that it held, by a 6-to-3 vote, that, even if Article 36 does grant rights, the defen-
dants in the two cases before it were not entitled to relief on their claims. It found,
specifically, that “suppression of evidence is [not] a proper remedy for a violation of
Article 36,” and that “an Article 36 claim may be deemed forfeited under state pro-
cedural rules because a defendant failed to raise the claim at trial.” Id. at 342.
