treaty-making power, not formally but in effect, as a determinative
element in the field of foreign policy. The President’s first impor-
tant utilization of the executive agreement device took the form of
an exchange of notes on November 16, 1933, with Maxim M. Litvinov,
the USSR Commissar for Foreign Affairs, whereby American recog-
nition was extended to the Soviet Union and certain pledges made
by each official.460
    The Hull-Lothian Agreement.—With the fall of France in June,
1940, President Roosevelt entered into two executive agreements the
total effect of which was to transform the role of the United States
from one of strict neutrality toward the European war to one of semi-
belligerency. The first agreement was with Canada and provided for
the creation of a Permanent Joint Board on Defense which would
“consider in the broad sense the defense of the north half of the
Western Hemisphere.” 461 Second, and more important than the first,
was the Hull-Lothian Agreement of September 2, 1940, under which,
in return for the lease for ninety-nine years of certain sites for na-
val bases in the British West Atlantic, the United States handed
over to the British Government fifty over-age destroyers which had
been reconditioned and recommissioned.462 And on April 9, 1941,
the State Department, in consideration of the just-completed Ger-

with the Danish minister in Washington, whereby the United States
acquired the right to occupy Greenland for purposes of defense.463
    The Post-War Years.—Post-war diplomacy of the United States
was greatly influenced by the executive agreements entered into at

into the multinational defense pacts, like NATO, SEATO, CENTRO,
and the like—re-established itself, but soon the executive agree-

to enter into the arrangement placed great reliance on the President’s “inherent”
powers under the Commander-in-Chief clause and as sole organ of foreign relations
but ultimately found adequate statutory authority to take the steps deemed desir-
able. 39 Ops. Atty. Gen. 484 (1940).
