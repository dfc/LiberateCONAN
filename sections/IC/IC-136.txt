plane testing secret electronics equipment, plaintiffs sought discov-
ery of the Air Force’s investigation report on the accident, and the
government resisted on a claim of privilege as to the nondisclosure
of military secrets. The Court accepted the Government’s claim, hold-
ing that courts must determine whether under the circumstances
the claim of privilege was appropriate without going so far as to
force disclosure of the thing the privilege is designed to protect. The
private litigant’s showing of necessity for the information should gov-
ern in each case how far the trial court should probe. Where the
necessity is strong, the court should require a strong showing of
the appropriateness of the privilege claim, but once the court is sat-
isfied of the appropriateness the privilege must prevail no matter
how compelling the need.599
    Reynolds dealt with an evidentiary privilege. There are other
circumstances, however, in which cases must be “dismissed on the
pleadings without ever reaching the question of evidence.” 600 In hold-
ing that federal courts should refuse to entertain a breach of con-
tract action seeking enforcement of an agreement to compensate some-
one who performed espionage services during the Civil War, the Court
in Totten v. United States declared that “public policy forbids the
maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would
inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself re-
gards as confidential.” 601

tal employees’ clearances, disciplines, or discharges often raises claims of such privi-
lege. E.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988); Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518 (1988). After the Court approved a governmental secrecy agreement
imposed on CIA employees, Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507 (1980), the govern-
ment expanded its secrecy program with respect to classified and “classifiable” infor-
mation. When Congress sought to curb this policy, the Reagan Administration con-
vinced a federal district judge to declare the restrictions void as invasive of the
President’s constitutional power to manage the executive. National Fed’n of Fed. Em-
ployees v. United States, 688 F. Supp. 671 (D.D.C. 1988), vacated and remanded sub
nom. American Foreign Service Ass’n v. Garfinkel, 490 U.S. 153 (1989). For similar
assertions in the context of plaintiffs suing the government for interference with their
civil and political rights during the protests against the Vietnam War, in which the
plaintiffs were generally denied the information in the possession of the govern-
ment under the state-secrets privilege, see Halkin v. Helms, 598 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir.
1978); Ellsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51 (D.C. Cir. 1983). For review and analysis,
see Quint, The Separation of Powers Under Carter, 62 TEX. L. REV. 785, 875–80 (1984).

ing and applying Totten’s “broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espio-
nage agreements are altogether forbidden”). The Court in Tenet distinguished Webster
v. Doe on the basis of “an obvious difference . . . between a suit brought by an ac-
knowledged (though covert) employee of the CIA and one filed by an alleged former
spy.” Id. at 10.
