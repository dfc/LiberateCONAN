the post offices.” 423 Congress has also approved, usually by resolu-
tion, other executive agreements, such as the annexing of Texas and
Hawaii and the acquisition of Samoa.424 A prolific source of execu-
tive agreements has been the authorization of reciprocal arrange-
ments between the United States and other countries for the secur-
ing of protection for patents, copyrights, and trademarks.425
    Reciprocal Trade Agreements.—The most copious source of
executive agreements has been legislation which provided author-
ity for entering into reciprocal trade agreements with other na-
tions.426 Such agreements in the form of treaties providing for the
reciprocal reduction of duties subject to implementation by Con-
gress were frequently entered into,427 but beginning with the Tariff
Act of 1890,428 Congress began to insert provisions authorizing the
Executive to bargain over reciprocity with no necessity of subse-
quent legislative action. The authority was widened in successive
acts.429 Then, in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934,430
Congress authorized the President to enter into agreements with
other nations for reductions of tariffs and other impediments to in-
ternational trade and to put the reductions into effect through proc-
lamation.431
     The Constitutionality of Trade Agreements.—In Field v.
Clark,432 legislation conferring authority on the President to con-
clude trade agreements was sustained against the objection that it
attempted an unconstitutional delegation “of both legislative and treaty-
making powers.” The Court met the first objection with an exten-
sive review of similar legislation from the inauguration of govern-
ment under the Constitution. The second objection it met with a
curt rejection: “What has been said is equally applicable to the ob-
jection that the third section of the act invests the President with
treaty-making power. The Court is of opinion that the third section
of the act of October 1, 1890, is not liable to the objection that it
