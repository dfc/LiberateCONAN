volved. But commencing with the Marshall Plan in 1948, Congress
has enacted programs of guaranties to American investors in speci-
fied foreign countries.748 More relevant to discussion here is that
Congress has attached to United States foreign assistance pro-
grams various amendments requiring the termination of assistance
and imposing other economic inducements where uncompensated ex-
propriations have been instituted.749 And when the Supreme Court
in 1964 applied the “act of state” doctrine so as not to examine the
validity of a taking of property by a foreign government recognized
by the United States but to defer to the decision of the foreign gov-
ernment,750 Congress reacted by attaching another amendment to
the foreign assistance act reversing the Court’s application of the
doctrine, except in certain circumstances, a reversal which was ap-
plied on remand of the case.751

          PRESIDENTIAL ACTION IN THE DOMAIN OF
            CONGRESS: THE STEEL SEIZURE CASE
     To avert a nationwide strike of steel workers that he believed
would jeopardize the national defense, President Truman, on April
8, 1952, issued an executive order directing the Secretary of Com-
merce to seize and operate most of the steel industry of the coun-
try.752 The order cited no specific statutory authorization but in-
voked generally the powers vested in the President by the Constitution
and laws of the United States. The Secretary issued the appropri-
ate orders to steel executives. The President promptly reported his
action to Congress, conceding Congress’s power to supersede his or-
der, but Congress did not do so, either then or a few days later when
the President sent up a special message.753 The steel companies sued,
a federal district court enjoined the seizure,754 and the Supreme Court
brought the case up prior to decision by the court of appeals.755 Six-
to-three, the Court affirmed the district court order, each member
of the majority, however, contributing an individual opinion as well
