the consideration of a particular stipulation in a treaty, has been
voluntarily withdrawn by one party, so that it is no longer obliga-
tory on the other; whether the views and acts of a foreign sover-
eign, manifested through his representative have given just occa-
sion to the political departments of our government to withhold the
execution of a promise contained in a treaty, or to act in direct con-
travention of such promise. . . . These powers have not been con-
fided by the people to the judiciary, which has no suitable means to
exercise them; but to the executive and the legislative departments
of our government. They belong to diplomacy and legislation, and
not to the administration of existing laws and it necessarily follows
that if they are denied to Congress and the Executive, in the exer-
cise of their legislative power, they can be found nowhere, in our
system of government.” Chief Justice Marshall’s language in Foster
v. Neilson 402 is to the same effect.

Indian Treaties
     In the early cases of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,403 and Worces-
ter v. Georgia,404 the Court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, held,
first, that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign state within
the meaning of that clause of the Constitution that extends the ju-
dicial power of the United States to controversies “between a State
or the citizens thereof and foreign states, citizens or subjects.” Sec-
ond, it held: “The Constitution, by declaring treaties already made,
as well as those to be made, to be the supreme law of the land,
had adopted and sanctioned the previous treaties with the Indian
nations, and consequently admits their rank among those powers
who are capable of making treaties. The words ‘treaty’ and ‘nation’
are words of our own language, selected in our diplomatic and leg-
islative proceedings, by ourselves, having each a definite and well
understood meaning. We have applied them to Indians, as we have
applied them to the other nations of the earth. They are applied to
all in the same sense.” 405
    Later cases established that the power to make treaties with
the Indian tribes was coextensive with the power to make treaties

fies this certainty considerably, and Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996 (1979), pro-
longs the uncertainty. See L. Henkin, supra at 208–16; Restatement, Foreign Rela-
tions, § 326.
