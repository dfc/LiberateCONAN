Great Britain that allowed the inspection of British vessels for con-
traband liquor and seizure if any was found had superseded the
authority conferred by a section of the Tariff Act of 1922 337 The
difficulty with this case is that the Tariff Act provision had been
reenacted in 1930,338 so that a simple application of the rule that
the later enactment governs should have caused a different result.
It may be suspected that the low estate to which Prohibition had
fallen and a desire to avoid a diplomatic controversy should the sei-
zure at issue have been upheld influenced the Court’s decision.
    When Is a Treaty Self-Executing.—Several references have
been made above to a distinction between treaties as self-executing
and as merely executory, in which case they are enforceable only
after the enactment of “legislation to carry them into effect.” 339 But
what is it about a treaty that makes it the law of the land and
gives a private litigant the right to rely on it in a court of law? As
early as 1801, the Supreme Court took notice of a treaty, and, find-
ing it applicable to the situation before it, gave judgment for the
petitioner based on it.340 In Foster v. Neilson,341 Chief Justice Mar-
shall explained that a treaty is to be regarded “as equivalent to an
act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself, without the aid
of any legislative provision.” A treaty will not be self-executing, how-
ever, “when the terms of the [treaty] stipulation import a contract—
when either of the parties engages to perform a particular act. . . .”
When this is the case, “the treaty addresses itself to the political,
not the judicial department; and the legislature must execute the
contract, before it can become a rule for the court.” 342
the United States and France, so that it is inaccurate to refer to the treaty as super-
seding a prior statute. In United States v. Forty-Three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U.S.
188 (1876), the treaty with an Indian tribe in which the tribe ceded certain terri-
tory, later included in a state, provided that a federal law restricting the sale of
liquor on the reservation would continue in effect in the territory ceded; the Court
found the stipulation an appropriate subject for settlement by treaty and the provi-
sion binding. See also Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U.S. 447 (1913).

treaties out of a belief in their constitutional necessity or because of some policy
reason. In regard to the former, it has always apparently been the practice to insert
in treaties affecting the revenue laws of the United States a proviso that they should
not be deemed effective until the necessary laws to carry them into operation should
be enacted by Congress. 1 W. Willoughby, supra, at 558. Perhaps of the same nature
was a qualification that cession of certain property in the Canal Zone should be de-
pendent upon action by Congress inserted in Article V of the 1955 Treaty with Panama.
