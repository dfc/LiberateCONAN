or not to carry into effect treaty provisions.319 At the conclusion of
the debate, the House voted not only the money but a resolution
offered by Madison stating that it did not claim any agency in the
treaty-making process, “but that when a treaty stipulates regula-
tions on any of the subjects submitted by the Constitution to the
power of Congress, it must depend for its execution as to such stipu-
lations on a law or laws to be passed by Congress, and it is the
constitutional right and duty of the House of Representatives in all
such cases to deliberate on the expediency or inexpediency of carry-
ing such treaty into effect, and to determine and act thereon as in
their judgment may be most conducive to the public good.” 320 This
early precedent with regard to appropriations has apparently been
uniformly adhered to.321
    Similarly, with regard to treaties that modify commercial tariff
arrangements, the practice has been that the House always in-
sisted on and the Senate acquiesced in legislation to carry into ef-
fect the provisions of such treaties.322 The earliest congressional dis-
pute came over an 1815 Convention with Great Britain,323 which
provided for reciprocal reduction of duties. President Madison there-
upon recommended to Congress such legislation as the convention
might require for effectuation. The Senate and some members of
the House believed that no implementing legislation was necessary
because of a statute that already permitted the President to reduce
duties on goods of nations that did not discriminate against United
States goods; the House majority felt otherwise and compromise leg-
islation was finally enacted acceptable to both points of view.324 But
subsequent cases have seen legislation enacted; 325 the Senate once
refused to ratify a treaty that purported to reduce statutorily deter-

     319 Debate in the House ran for more than a month. It was excerpted from the

ANNALS separately published as DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED
STATES, DURING THE FIRST SESSION OF THE FOURTH CONGRESS UPON THE CONSTITUTIONAL POW-
ERS OF THE HOUSE WITH RESPECT TO TREATIES (1796). A source of much valuable informa-
tion on the views of the Framers and those who came after them on the treaty power,
the debates are analyzed in detail in E. BYRD, TREATIES AND EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS IN
THE UNITED STATES 35–59 (1960). Gallatin served in the United States Senate for two
months in 1793–1794, the House of Representatives from 1795–1801, and as Secre-
tary of the Treasury from 1801–1814.
