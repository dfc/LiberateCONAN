pounded.167 The great majority of the instances cited involved fights
with pirates, landings of small naval contingents on barbarous or
semibarbarous coasts to protect commerce, the dispatch of small bod-
ies of troops to chase bandits across the Mexican border, and the
like, and some incidents supposedly without authorization from Con-
gress did in fact have underlying statutory or other legislative au-
thorization. Some instances, e.g., President Polk’s use of troops to
precipitate war with Mexico in 1846, President Grant’s attempt to
annex the Dominican Republic, President McKinley’s dispatch of troops
into China during the Boxer Rebellion, involved considerable exer-
cises of presidential power, but in general purposes were limited
and congressional authority was sought for the use of troops against
a sovereign state or in such a way as to constitute war. The early
years of this century saw the expansion in the Caribbean and Latin
America both of the use of troops for the furthering of what was
perceived to be our national interests and of the power of the Presi-
dent to deploy the military force of the United States without con-
gressional authorization.168
    The pre-war actions of Presidents Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt
advanced in substantial degrees the fact of presidential initiative,
although the theory did not begin to catch up with the fact until
the “Great Debate” over the commitment of troops by the United
States to Europe under the Atlantic Pact. While congressional au-
thorization was obtained, that debate, the debate over the United
Nations charter, and the debate over Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty of 1949, declaring that “armed attack” against one signa-
tory was to be considered as “an attack” against all signatories, pro-
vided the occasion for the formulation of a theory of independent
presidential power to use the armed forces in the national interest
to send our forces into battle. The memorandum that we prepared listed eighty-
seven instances in the past century in which his predecessors had done this. And
thus yet another decision was made.” D. ACHESON, PRESENT AT THE CREATION 414, 415
