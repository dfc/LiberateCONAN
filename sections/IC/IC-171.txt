lion of 1792.723 In Martin v. Mott,724 which arose out of the War of
1812, the Court held that the authority to decide whether the exi-
gency had arisen belonged exclusively to the President.725 Even be-
fore that time, Jefferson had, in 1808, in the course of his efforts to
enforce the Embargo Acts, issued a proclamation ordering “all offi-
cers having authority, civil or military, who shall be found in the
vicinity” of an unruly combination, to aid and assist “by all means
in their power, by force of arms or otherwise” the suppression of
such combination.726 Forty-six years later, Attorney General Cush-
ing advised President Pierce that in enforcing the Fugitive Slave
Act of 1850, marshals of the United States had authority when op-
posed by unlawful combinations to summon to their aid not only
bystanders and citizens generally, but armed forces within their pre-
cincts, both state militia and United States officers, soldiers, sail-
ors, and marines,727 a doctrine that Pierce himself improved upon
two years later by asserting, with reference to the civil war then
raging in Kansas, that it lay within his obligation to take care that
the laws be faithfully executed to place the forces of the United States
in Kansas at the disposal of the marshal there, to be used as a por-
tion of the posse comitatus. Lincoln’s call of April 15, 1861, for 75,000
volunteers was, on the other hand, a fresh invocation, though of
course on a vastly magnified scale, of Jefferson’s conception of a posse
comitatus subject to presidential call.728 The provisions above ex-
tracted from the United States Code ratified this conception with
regard to the state militias and the national forces.

152, 18 U.S.C. § 1385, it was provided that “it shall not be lawful to employ any
part of the Army of the United States, as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the
purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances
as such employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the Constitution
or by act of Congress. . . .” The effect of this prohibition, however, was largely nul-
lified by a ruling of the Attorney General “that by Revised Statutes 5298 and 5300
[10 U.S.C. §§ 332, 334] the military forces, under the direction of the President, could
be used to assist a marshal. 16 Ops. Atty. Gen. 162.” B. RICH, THE PRESIDENTS AND
