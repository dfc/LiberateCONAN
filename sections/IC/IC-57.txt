tory grounds.227 However, the Court did find that the government
may not detain the petitioner indefinitely for purposes of interroga-
tion, and must afford him the opportunity to offer evidence that he
is not an enemy combatant.228
     In Rasul v. Bush,229 the Court rejected an Executive Branch ar-
gument that foreign prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay were
outside of federal court jurisdiction. The Court distinguished ear-
lier case law arising during World War II that denied habeas cor-
pus petitions from German citizens who had been captured and tried
overseas by United States military tribunals.230 In Rasul, the Court
noted that the Guantanamo petitioners were not citizens of a coun-
try at war with the United States,231 had not been afforded any
form of tribunal, and were being held in a territory over which the
United States exercised exclusive jurisdiction and control.232 In ad-
dition, the Court found that statutory grounds existed for the exten-
sion of habeas corpus to these prisoners.233
     In response to Rasul, Congress amended the habeas statute to
eliminate all federal habeas jurisdiction over detainees, whether its
     227 542 U.S. 507 (2004). There was no opinion of the Court. Justice O’Connor,

joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer, avoided rul-
ing on the Executive Branch argument that such detentions could be authorized by
its Article II powers alone, and relied instead on the “Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force” passed by Congress. Justice Thomas also found that the Executive Branch
had the power to detain the petitioner, although his dissenting opinion found that
such detentions were authorized by Article II. Justice Souter, joined by Justice Ginsberg,
rejected the argument that the Congress had authorized such detentions, while Jus-
tice Scalia, joined with Justice Stevens, denied that such congressional authoriza-
tion was possible without a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
     228 At a minimum, the petitioner must be given notice of the asserted factual

basis for holding him, must be given a fair chance to rebut that evidence before a
neutral decisionmaker, and must be allowed to consult an attorney. 542 U.S. at 533,

     233 The Court found that 28 U.S.C. § 2241, which had previously been con-

strued to require the presence of a petitioner in a district court’s jurisdiction, was
now satisfied by the presence of a jailor-custodian. See Braden v. 30th Judicial Cir-
cuit Court, 410 U.S. 484 (1973). Another “enemy combatant” case, this one involv-
ing an American citizen arrested on American soil, was remanded after the Court
found that a federal court’s habeas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 was limited
to jurisdiction over the immediate custodian of a petitioner. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542
U.S. 426 (2004) (federal court’s jurisdiction over Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld not
sufficient to satisfy presence requirement under 28 U.S.C. § 2241). In Munaf v. Geren,
128 S. Ct. 2207 (2008), the Court held that the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C.
§ 2241, applied to American citizens held by the Multinational Force—Iraq, an inter-
national coalition force operating in Iraq and composed of 26 different nations, in-
cluding the United States. The Court concluded that the habeas statute extends to
American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an Ameri-
can chain of command, even when those forces are acting as part of a multinational
coalition.
