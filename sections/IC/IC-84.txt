states, was presented as recently as 1920, when the Court upheld
a treaty and implementing statute providing for the protection of
migratory birds.367 “The treaty in question does not contravene any
prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only ques-
tion is whether it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the
general terms of the Tenth Amendment.” 368 The gist of the holding
followed. “Here a national interest of very nearly the first magni-
tude is involved. It can be protected only by national action in con-
cert with that of another power. The subject-matter is only transitorily
within the State and has no permanent habitat therein. But for the
treaty and the statute there soon might be no birds for any powers
to deal with. We see nothing in the Constitution that compels the
government to sit by while a food supply is cut off and the protec-
tors of our forests and our crops are destroyed.” 369
     The doctrine that seems to follow from this case and others is
“that in all that properly relates to matters of international rights
and obligations, whether these rights and obligations rest upon the
general principles of international law or have been conventionally
created by specific treaties, the United States possesses all the pow-
ers of a constitutionally centralized sovereign State; and, therefore,
that when the necessity from the international standpoint arises
the treaty power may be exercised, even though thereby the rights
ordinarily reserved to the States are invaded.” 370 It is not, in other
words, the treaty power that enlarges either the federal power or
the congressional power, but the international character of the in-
terest concerned that might be acted upon.
     Dicta in some of the cases lend support to the argument that
the treaty power is limited by the delegation of powers among the
branches of the National Government 371 and especially by the del-
egated powers of Congress, although it is not clear what the limita-
tion means. If it is meant that no international agreement could be
constitutionally entered into by the United States within the sphere
of such powers, the practice from the beginning has been to the con-
trary; 372 if it is meant that treaty provisions dealing with matters
delegated to Congress must, in order to become the law of the land,

“those subjects of legislation in which [the Constitution] gave a participation to the
House of Representatives,” although he admitted “that it would leave very little mat-
ter for the treaty power to work on.” Jefferson’s Manual, supra, at 299.
