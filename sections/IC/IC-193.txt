this interpretation that the major arguments, scholarly and politi-
cal, have concerned the question of whether judges, as well as oth-
ers, are subject to impeachment for conduct that does not consti-
tute an indictable offense, and the question of whether impeachment
is the exclusive removal device for judges.826
Judgment—Removal and Disqualification
     Article II, section 4 provides that officers impeached and con-
victed “shall be removed from office”; Article I, section 3, clause 7
provides further that “judgment in cases of impeachment shall not
extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to
hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United
States.” These restrictions on judgment, both of which relate to ca-
pacity to hold public office, emphasize the non-penal nature of im-
peachment, and help to distinguish American impeachment from the
open-ended English practice under which criminal penalties could
be imposed.827
     The plain language of section 4 seems to require removal from
office upon conviction, and in fact the Senate has removed those
liam Belknap (acquitted); President Andrew Johnson (acquitted); and President Wil-
liam J. Clinton (acquitted). For summary and discussion of the earlier cases, see

     826 It has been argued that the impeachment clause of Article II is a limitation

on the power of Congress to remove judges and that Article III is a limitation on
the executive power of removal, but that it is open to Congress to define “good be-
havior” and establish a mechanism by which judges may be judicially removed. Shartel,

the Constitution, 28 MICH. L. REV. 485, 723, 870 (1930). Proposals to this effect were
considered in Congress in the 1930s and 1940s and revived in the late 1960s, stimu-
lating much controversy in scholarly circles. E.g., Kramer & Barron, The Constitu-
tionality of Removal and Mandatory Retirement Procedures for the Federal Judi-
ciary: The Meaning of “During Good Behavior,” 35 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 455 (1967);
Ziskind, Judicial Tenure in the American Constitution: English and American Prec-
edents, 1969 SUP. CT. REV. 135; Berger, Impeachment of Judges and “Good Behavior”
Tenure, 79 YALE L. J. 1475 (1970). Congress did in the Judicial Conduct and Disabil-
ity Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96–458, 94 Stat. 2035, 28 U.S.C. § 1 note, 331, 332, 372,
604, provide for disciplinary powers over federal judges, but it specifically denied
any removal power. The National Commission, supra at 17–26, found impeachment
to be the exclusive means of removal and recommended against adoption of an alter-
native. Congress repealed 28 U.S.C. § 372 in the Judicial Improvements Act of 2002,
Pub. L. 107–273 and created a new chapter (28 U.S.C. §§ 351–64) dealing with judi-
cial discipline short of removal for Article III judges, and authorizing discipline in-
cluding removal for magistrate judges. The issue was obliquely before the Court as
a result of a judicial conference action disciplining a district judge, but it was not
reached, Chandler v. Judicial Council, 382 U.S. 1003 (1966); 398 U.S. 74 (1970), ex-
cept by Justices Black and Douglas in dissent, who argued that impeachment was
the exclusive power.
