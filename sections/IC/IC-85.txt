receive the assent of Congress through implementing legislation, it
states not a limitation on the power of making treaties as interna-
tional conventions but rather a necessary procedure before certain
conventions are cognizable by the courts in the enforcement of rights
under them.
     It has also been suggested that the prohibitions against govern-
mental action contained in the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights
in particular, limit the exercise of the treaty power. No doubt this
is true, though again there are no cases which so hold.373
    One other limitation of sorts may be contained in the language
of certain court decisions that seem to say that only matters of “in-
ternational concern” may be the subject of treaty negotiations.374
Although this may appear to be a limitation, it does not take ac-
count of the elasticity of the concept of “international concern” by
which the subject matter of treaties has constantly expanded over
the years.375 At best, any attempted resolution of the issue of limi-
tations must be an uneasy one.376
    In brief, the fact that all the foreign relations power is vested
in the National Government and that no formal restriction is im-
posed on the treaty-making power in the international context 377
     373 Cf. Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). See also Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S.

258, 267 (1890).
     374 “[I]t must be assumed that the framers of the Constitution intended that

[the treaty power] should extend to all those objects which in the intercourse of na-
tions had usually been regarded as the proper subjects of negotiation and treaty. . . .”
Holden v. Joy, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 211, 243 (1872). With the exceptions noted, “it is
not perceived that there is any limit to the questions which can be adjusted touch-
ing any matter which is properly the subject of negotiation with a foreign country.”
Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258, 267 (1890). “The treatymaking power of the United
States . . . does extend to all proper subjects of negotiation between our govern-
ment and other nations.” Asakura v. City of Seattle, 265 U.S. 332, 341 (1924).
     375 Cf. L. Henkin, supra, at 151–56.
     376 Other reservations have been expressed. One contention has been that the

territory of a state may not be ceded without such state’s consent. Geofroy v. Riggs,
133 U.S. 258, 267 (1890), citing Fort Leavenworth R.R. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 541
(1885). Cf. the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, Article V, 8 Stat. 572, 575. But see S. Crandall,
supra, at 220–229; 1 W. Willoughby, supra, at 572–576.
     A further contention is that, although foreign territory may be annexed to the
United States by the treaty power, it may not be incorporated with the United States
except with the consent of Congress. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 310–344 (1901)
(four Justices dissenting). This argument appears to be a variation of the one in
regard to the correct procedure to give domestic effect to treaties.
     Another argument grew out the XII Hague Convention of 1907, proposing an
International Prize Court with appellate jurisdiction from national courts in prize
cases. President Taft objected that no treaty could transfer to a tribunal not known
to the Constitution any part of the judicial power of the United States, and a com-
promise was arranged. Q. Wright, supra, at 117–118; H. REP. NO. 1569, 68th Con-
gress, 2d Sess. (1925).
     377 Cf. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936);

Holmes v. Jennison, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 540, 575–576 (1840).
