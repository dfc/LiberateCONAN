were enacted between 1916 and 1951, and summaries of seizures
of industrial plants and facilities by Presidents without definite statu-
tory warrant, eight of which occurred during World War I—
justified in presidential orders as being done pursuant to “the Con-
stitution and laws” generally—and eleven of which occurred in World
War II.766 The first such seizure in this period had been justified
by then Attorney General Jackson as being based upon an “aggre-
gate” of presidential powers stemming from his duty to see the laws
faithfully executed, his commander-in-chiefship, and his general ex-
ecutive powers.767 Chief Justice Vinson’s dissent dwelt liberally upon
this opinion,768 which reliance drew a disclaimer from Justice Jack-
son, concurring.769
     The dissent was also fortunate in that the steel companies’ chief
counsel, John W. Davis, a former Solicitor General of the United
States, had filed a brief in 1914 in defense of Presidential action,
which had taken precisely the view that the dissent now pre-
sented.770 “Ours,” the brief read, “is a self-sufficient Government within
its sphere. (Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 395; in re Debs, 158
U.S. 564, 578.) ‘Its means are adequate to its ends’ (McCulloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat., 316, 424), and it is rational to assume that
its active forces will be found equal in most things to the emergen-
cies that confront it. While perfect flexibility is not to be expected
in a Government of divided powers, and while division of power is
one of the principal features of the Constitution, it is the plain duty
of those who are called upon to draw the dividing lines to ascertain
the essential, recognize the practical, and avoid a slavish formal-
ism which can only serve to ossify the government and reduce its
efficiency without any compensating good. The function of making
laws is peculiar to Congress, and the Executive can not exercise
that function to any degree. But this is not to say that all of the
subjects concerning which laws might be made are perforce re-
moved from the possibility of Executive influence. The Executive may
act upon things and upon men in many relations which have not,
though they might have, been actually regulated by Congress. In
    766  343 U.S. at 611–13, 620.
    767  89 CONG. REC. 3992 (1943).
     768 343 U.S. at 695–96 (dissenting opinion).
     769 Thus, Justice Jackson noted of the earlier seizure, that “[i]ts superficial simi-

larities with the present case, upon analysis, yield to distinctions so decisive that it
cannot be regarded as even a precedent, much less an authority for the present sei-
zure.” 343 U.S. at 648–49 (concurring opinion). His opinion opens with the sen-
tence: “That comprehensive and undefined presidential powers hold both practical
advantages and grave dangers for the country will impress anyone who has served
as legal adviser to a President in time of transition and public anxiety.” Id. at 634.
