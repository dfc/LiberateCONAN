informed him that “as the President was the only channel of com-
munication between the United States and foreign nations, it was
from him alone ‘that foreign nations or their agents are to learn
what is or has been the will of the nation’; that whatever he com-
municated as such, they had a right and were bound to consider
‘as the expression of the nation’; and that no foreign agent could be
‘allowed to question it,’ or ‘to interpose between him and any other
branch of government, under the pretext of either’s transgressing
their functions.’ Mr. Jefferson therefore declined to enter into any
discussion of the question as to whether it belonged to the Presi-
dent under the Constitution to admit or exclude foreign agents. ‘I
inform you of the fact,’ he said, ‘by authority from the President.’
Mr. Jefferson returned the consul’s commission and declared that
the President would issue no exequatur to a consul except upon a
commission correctly addressed.” 635
    The Logan Act.—When in 1798 a Philadelphia Quaker named
Logan went to Paris on his own to undertake a negotiation with
the French Government with a view to averting war between France
and the United States, his enterprise stimulated Congress to pass
“An Act to Prevent Usurpation of Executive Functions,” 636 which,
“more honored in the breach than the observance,” still survives on
the statute books.637 The year following, John Marshall, then a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives, defended President John Adams
for delivering a fugitive from justice to Great Britain under the 27th
article of the Jay Treaty, instead of leaving the business to the courts.
He said: “The President is the sole organ of the nation in its exter-
nal relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations. Of
consequence, the demand of a foreign nation can only be made on
him. He possesses the whole Executive power. He holds and directs
the force of the nation. Of consequence, any act to be performed by
the force of the nation is to be performed through him.” 638 Ninety-

tails concerning the observance of the “Logan Act” are given in E. Corwin, supra at

e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318, 319 (1936), as
if he were claiming sole or inherent executive power in foreign relations, but Mar-
shall carefully propounded the view that Congress could provide the rules underly-
ing the President’s duty to extradite. When, in 1848, Congress did enact such a stat-
ute, the Court sustained it. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 714 (1893).
