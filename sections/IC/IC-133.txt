vided the Senate approves the nomination.587 In 1940, the Presi-
dent was sustained in removing Dr. E. A. Morgan from the chair-
manship of TVA for refusal to produce evidence in substantiation
of charges which he had leveled at his fellow directors.588 Although
no such cause of removal by the President was stated in the act
creating TVA, the President’s action, being reasonably required to
promote the smooth functioning of TVA, was held to be within his
duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” So inter-
preted, the removal did not violate the principle of administrative
independence.

The Presidential Aegis: Demands for Papers
    Presidents have more than once had occasion to stand in a pro-
tective relation to their subordinates, assuming their defense in liti-
gation brought against them 589 or pressing litigation in their be-
half,590 refusing a congressional call for papers which might be used,
in their absence from the seat of government, to their disadvan-
tage,591 challenging the constitutional validity of legislation deemed
detrimental to their interests.592 Presidents throughout our history
have attempted to spread their own official immunity to their sub-
ordinates by resisting actions of the courts or of congressional com-
mittees to require subordinates to divulge communications from or
to the President that Presidents choose to regard as confidential.
Only recently, however, has the focus of the controversy shifted from
protection of presidential or executive interests to protection of the
President himself, and the locus of the dispute shifted to the courts.
    Following years in which claims of executive privilege were re-
solved in primarily interbranch disputes on the basis of the politi-
cal strengths of the parties, the issue finally became subject to ju-
dicial elaboration. The doctrine of executive privilege was at once
recognized as existing and having a constitutional foundation while
at the same time it was definitely bounded in its assertion by the
principle of judicial review. Because of these cases, because of the
intensified congressional-presidential dispute, and especially be-
cause of the introduction of the issue into an impeachment proceed-
ing, a somewhat lengthy treatment of the doctrine is called for.
