dent Clinton was charged were so outrageous as to impair his abil-
ity to govern, and hence to justify removal.879 Similarly, the almost
evenly divided Senate vote to acquit meant that there was no con-
sensus that removal was justified on the alternative theory that the
alleged perjury and obstruction of justice so damaged the judiciary
as to constitute an impeachable “offense against the state.” 880

Judicial Review of Impeachments
     It was long assumed that no judicial review of the impeach-
ment process was possible, that impeachment presents a true “po-
litical question” case, i.e., that the Constitution’s conferral on the
Senate of the “sole” power to try impeachments is a textually de-
monstrable constitutional commitment of trial procedures to the Sen-
ate to decide without court review. That assumption was not con-
tested until very recently, when Judges Nixon and Hastings challenged
their Senate convictions.881
    In the Judge Nixon case, the Court held that a claim to judi-
cial review of an issue arising in an impeachment trial in the Sen-
ate presents a nonjusticiable “political question.” 882 Specifically, the
Court rejected a claim that the Senate had departed from the mean-
ing of the word “try” in the impeachment clause by relying on a
special committee to take evidence, including testimony. But the Court’s




     879 One commentator, analogizing to the impeachment and conviction of Judge

Claiborne for income tax evasion, viewed the basic issue in the Clinton case as whether
his alleged misconduct was so outrageous as to “effectively rob[ ] him of the requi-
site moral authority to continue to function as President.” Gerhardt, supra n.817, at
619. Under this view, the Claiborne conviction established that income tax evasion
by a judge, although unrelated to official duties, reveals the judge as lacking the
unquestioned integrity and moral authority necessary to preside over criminal tri-
als, especially those involving tax evasion.
     880 Senator Thompson propounded this theory in arguing that “abuse of power”

is too narrow a category to encompass all forms of subversion of government that
should be grounds for removal. 145 CONG. REC. S1556 (daily ed. Feb. 12, 1999).
     881 Both judges challenged the use under Rule XI of a trial committee to hear

the evidence and report to the full Senate, which would then carry out the trial.
The rule was adopted in the aftermath of an embarrassingly sparse attendance at
the trial of Judge Louderback in 1935. National Comm. Report, supra at 50–53, 54–
57; Grimes, supra at 1233–37. In the Nixon case, the lower courts held the issue to
be non-justiciable (Nixon v. United States, 744 F. Supp. 9 (D.D.C. 1990), aff’d, 938
F.2d 239 (D.C. Cir. 1991), but a year later a district court initially ruled in Judge
Hastings’ favor. Hastings v. United States, 802 F. Supp. 490 (D.D.C. 1992), vacated,
988 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1993).
     882 Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 (1993). Nixon at the time of his convic-

tion and removal from office was a federal district judge in Mississippi.
