       ment, providing that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United
       States” are citizens.101 Significantly, however, Congress, in which a
       number of Framers sat, provided in the Naturalization act of 1790
       that “the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born
       beyond the sea, . . . shall be considered as natural born citizens
       . . . .” 102 This phrasing followed the literal terms of British stat-
       utes, beginning in 1350, under which persons born abroad, whose
       parents were both British subjects, would enjoy the same rights of
       inheritance as those born in England; beginning with laws in 1709
       and 1731, these statutes expressly provided that such persons were
       natural-born subjects of the crown.103 There is reason to believe,
       therefore, that the phrase includes persons who become citizens at
       birth by statute because of their status in being born abroad of Ameri-
       can citizens.104 Whether the Supreme Court would decide the issue
       should it ever arise in a “case or controversy”—as well as how it
       might decide it—can only be speculated about.

    Clause 6. In Case of the Removal of the President from Of-
fice, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the
Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on
the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for
the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the
President and Vice President declaring what Officer shall then

            101 Reliance on the provision of an Amendment adopted subsequent to the con-

       stitutional provision being interpreted is not precluded by but is strongly militated
       against by the language in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 886–87 (1991),
       in which the Court declined to be bound by the language of the 25th Amendment in
       determining the meaning of “Heads of Departments” in the Appointments Clause.
       See also id. at 917 (Justice Scalia concurring). If the Fourteenth Amendment is rel-
       evant and the language is exclusive, that is, if it describes the only means by which
       persons can become citizens, then, anyone born outside the United States would have
       to be considered naturalized in order to be a citizen, and a child born abroad of
       American parents is to be considered “naturalized” by being statutorily made a citi-
       zen at birth. Although dictum in certain cases supports this exclusive interpretation
       of the Fourteenth Amendment, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 702–03
       (1898); cf. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308, 312 (1961), the most recent case in
       its holding and language rejects it. Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971).
            102 Act of March 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 103, 104 (emphasis supplied). See Weedin v.

       Chin Bow, 274 U.S. 657, 661–666 (1927); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S.
       649, 672–675 (1898). With minor variations, this language remained law in subse-
       quent reenactments until an 1802 Act, which omitted the italicized words for rea-
       sons not discernable. See Act of Feb. 10, 1855, 10 Stat. 604 (enacting same provi-
       sion, for offspring of American-citizen fathers, but omitting the italicized phrase).
