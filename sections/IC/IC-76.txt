mined duties,326 and congressional enactment of authority for the
President to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements all seem to point
to the necessity of some form of congressional implementation.
    What other treaty provisions need congressional implementa-
tion is debatable. A 1907 memorandum approved by the Secretary
of State stated that the limitations on the treaty power that neces-
sitate legislative implementation may “be found in the provisions
of the Constitution which expressly confide in Congress or in other
branches of the Federal Government the exercise of certain of the
delegated powers. . . .” 327 The same thought has been expressed in
Congress 328 and by commentators.329 Resolution of the issue seems
to be for legislative and executive branches rather than for the courts.
    Congressional Repeal of Treaties.—Madison contended that,
when Congress is asked to carry a treaty into effect, it has the con-
stitutional right, and indeed the duty, to determine the matter ac-
cording to its own ideas of what is expedient.330 Developments have
vindicated Madison in this regard. This is seen in the answer that
the Court gave to the question: What happens when a treaty provi-
sion and an act of Congress conflict? The answer is that neither
has any intrinsic superiority over the other and therefore the later
one will prevail. In short, the treaty commitments of the United
States do not diminish Congress’s constitutional powers. To be sure,
legislative repeal of a treaty as law of the land may amount to its
violation as an international contract. In such case, as the Court
said, “its infraction becomes the subject of international negotia-
tions and reclamations, so far as the injured party chooses to seek

     328 At the conclusion of the 1815 debate, the Senate conferees noted in their

report that some treaties might need legislative implementation, which Congress was
bound to provide, but did not indicate what in their opinion made some treaties
self-executing and others not. 29 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 160 (1816). The House confer-
ees observed that they thought, and that in their opinion the Senate conferees agreed,
that legislative implementation was necessary to carry into effect all treaties which
contained “stipulations requiring appropriations, or which might bind the nation to
lay taxes, to raise armies, to support navies, to grant subsidies, to create States, or
to cede territory. . . .” Id. at 1019. Much the same language was included in a later
report, H. REP. NO. 37, 40th Congress, 2d Sess. (1868). Controversy with respect to
the sufficiency of Senate ratification of the Panama Canal treaties to dispose of United
States property therein to Panama was extensive. A divided Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia reached the question and held that Senate approval of the
treaty alone was sufficient. Edwards v. Carter, 580 F.2d 1055 (D.C. Cir.), cert. de-
