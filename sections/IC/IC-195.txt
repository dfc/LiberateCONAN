the impeachment of the Earl of Suffolk in 1388.835 Treason is de-
fined in the Constitution.836 Bribery is not, but it had a clear com-
mon law meaning and is now well covered by statute.837 “High crimes
and misdemeanors,” however, is an undefined and indefinite phrase,
which, in England, had comprehended conduct not constituting in-
dictable offenses.838 Use of the word “other” to link “high crimes
and misdemeanors” with “treason” and “bribery” is arguably indica-
tive of the types and seriousness of conduct encompassed by “high
crimes and misdemeanors.” Similarly, the word “high” apparently
carried with it a restrictive meaning.839
    Debate prior to adoption of the phrase 840 and comments there-
after in the ratifying conventions 841 were to the effect that the Presi-
dent (all the debate was in terms of the President) should be remov-
able by impeachment for commissions or omissions in office which
were not criminally cognizable. And in the First Congress’s “re-
moval” debate, Madison maintained that the wanton dismissal of
meritorious officers would be an act of maladministration which would
render the President subject to impeachment.842 Other comments,
especially in the ratifying conventions, tend toward a limitation of
the term to criminal, perhaps gross criminal, behavior.843 The scope
of the power has been the subject of continuing debate.844

     839 The extradition provision reported by the Committee on Detail had provided

for the delivering up of persons charged with “Treason[,] Felony or high Misdemean-
ors.” 2 M. Farrand, supra, at 174. But the phrase “high Misdemeanors” was re-
placed with “other crimes” “in order to comprehend all proper cases: it being doubt-
ful whether ‘high misdemeanor’ had not a technical meaning too limited.” Id. at 443.
