of the nation is vested in the President; subject only to the excep-
tions and qualifications, which are expressed in the instrument.” 18
     Madison’s reply to Hamilton, in five closely reasoned articles,19
was almost exclusively directed to Hamilton’s development of the
contention from the quoted language that the conduct of foreign re-
lations was in its nature an executive function and that the powers
vested in Congress which bore on this function, such as the power
to declare war, did not diminish the discretion of the President in
the exercise of his powers. Madison’s principal reliance was on the
vesting of the power to declare war in Congress, thus making it a
legislative function rather than an executive one, combined with the
argument that possession of the exclusive power carried with it the
exclusive right to judgment about the obligations to go to war or to
stay at peace, negating the power of the President to proclaim the
nation’s neutrality. Implicit in the argument was the rejection of
the view that the first section of Article II bestowed powers not vested
in subsequent sections. “Were it once established that the powers
of war and treaty are in their nature executive; that so far as they
are not by strict construction transferred to the legislature, they
actually belong to the executive; that of course all powers not less
executive in their nature than those powers, if not granted to the
legislature, may be claimed by the executive; if granted, are to be
taken strictly, with a residuary right in the executive; or . . . per-
haps claimed as a concurrent right by the executive; and no citizen
could any longer guess at the character of the government under
which he lives; the most penetrating jurist would be unable to scan
the extent of constructive prerogative.” 20 The arguments are today
pursued with as great fervor, as great learning, and with two hun-
dred years experience, but the constitutional part of the contentious-
ness still settles upon the reading of the vesting clauses of Articles
I, II, and III.21

executive officeholders, cf. C. THACH, THE CREATION OF THE PRESIDENCY 1775–1789 ch. 6
(1923), Madison had urged contentions quite similar to Hamilton’s, finding in the
first section of Article II and in the obligation to execute the laws a vesting of execu-
tive powers sufficient to contain the power solely on his behalf to remove subordi-
nates. 1 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 496–497. Madison’s language here was to be heavily
relied on by Chief Justice Taft on this point in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52,

stitution, in 4 SELECTED ESSAYS ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 1467, 1474–1483, 1485–1486 (1938).
