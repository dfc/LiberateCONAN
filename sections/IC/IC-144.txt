he has been confirmed by the Senate.622 This and other provisions
governing recess appointments are designed to protect the Senate’s
advice and consent function by confining the recess appointment power
of the President. By targeting the compensation of appointees as
opposed to the President’s recess appointment power itself, these
limitations act as indirect controls on recess appointments, and their
constitutionality has not been adjudicated. A federal district court
noted that “if any and all restrictions on the President’s recess ap-
pointment power, however limited, are prohibited by the Constitu-
tion, 5 U.S.C. § 5503 . . . might . . . be invalid.” 623 Additional con-
stitutional concerns might arise from the application of these provisions
to judicial recess appointees.624

Judicial Appointments
     Federal judges clearly fall within the terms of the Recess Ap-
pointments Clause. But, unlike with other offices, a problem exists.
Article III judges are appointed “during good behavior,” subject only
to removal through impeachment. A judge, however, who is given a
recess appointment may be “removed” by the Senate’s failure to ad-
vise and consent to his appointment; moreover, on the bench, prior
to Senate confirmation, he or she may be subject to influence not
felt by other judges. Nonetheless, a constitutional attack upon the
status of a federal district judge, given a recess appointment and
then withdrawn as a nominee, was rejected by a federal court.625

     622 5 U.S.C. § 5503. The provision has been on the books in some form since 12

Stat. 646 (1863).
     623 Staebler v. Carter, 464 F. Supp. 585, 596 n.24 (D.D.C. 1979).
     624 See Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220, 1224 n.6 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. de-

nied, 544 U.S. 942 (2005) (“To our knowledge, Congress has never attempted to di-
minish the pay of a recess-appointed judge while he was in office. Whether such an
attempt would be constitutional is itself an open question.”).
     625 United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc), cert.

denied, 475 U.S. 1048 (1986). The opinions in the court of appeals provide a wealth
of data on the historical practice of giving recess appointments to judges, including
the developments in the Eisenhower Administration, when three Justices, Warren,
Brennan, and Stewart, were so appointed and later confirmed after participation on
the Court. The Senate in 1960 adopted a “sense of the Senate” resolution suggest-
ing that the practice was not a good idea. 106 CONG. REC. 18130–18145 (1960). Other
cases holding that the President’s power under the Recess Appointments Clause ex-
tends to filling judicial vacancies in Article III courts include United States v. Al-
locco, 305 F.2d 704 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 964 (1963), and Evans v.
Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 942 (2005). In the
latter case, however, Justice Stevens, although concurring in the denial of the peti-
tion of certiorari, wrote that “it would be a mistake to assume that our disposition
of this petition constitutes a decision on the merits of whether the President has
the constitutional authority to fill future Article III vacancies, such as vacancies on
this Court, with appointments made absent consent of the Senate during short intrases-
sion ‘recesses.’ ” 544 U.S. at 943.
