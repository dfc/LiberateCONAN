is that he has been deprived of his liberty without due process of
law. But it is familiar that what is due process of law depends on
circumstances. . . . So long as such arrests are made in good faith
and in honest belief that they are needed in order to head the in-
surrection off, the Governor is the final judge and cannot be sub-
jected to an action after he is out of office on the ground that he
had not reasonable ground for his belief.” 211 The “good faith” test
of Moyer, however, was superseded by the “direct relation” test of
Sterling v. Constantin,212 where the Court made it very clear that
“[i]t does not follow . . . that every sort of action the Governor may
take, no matter how justified by the exigency or subversive of pri-
vate right and the jurisdiction of the courts, otherwise available, is
conclusively supported by mere executive fiat. . . . What are the al-
lowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have
been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.” 213
    Martial Law in Hawaii.—The question of the constitutional
status of martial law was raised again in World War II by the proc-
lamation of Governor Poindexter of Hawaii, on December 7, 1941,
suspending the writ of habeas corpus and conferring on the local
commanding General of the Army all his own powers as governor
and also “all of the powers normally exercised by the judicial offi-
cers . . . of this territory . . . during the present emergency and
until the danger of invasion is removed.” Two days later the Gover-
nor’s action was approved by President Roosevelt. The regime which
the proclamation set up continued with certain abatements until
October 24, 1944.
    By section 67 of the Organic Act of April 30, 1900,214 the Terri-
torial Governor was authorized “in case of rebellion or invasion, or
imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, [to]
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the Ter-
ritory, or any part thereof, under martial law until communication
can be had with the President and his decision thereon made known.”

    211 212 U.S. at 83–85.
    212 287 U.S. 378 (1932). “The nature of the power also necessarily implies that
there is a permitted range of honest judgment as to the measures to be taken in
meeting force with force, in suppressing violence and restoring order, for without
such liberty to make immediate decision, the power itself would be useless. Such
measures, conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency and directly related
to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its continuance, fall within the
discretion of the Executive in the exercise of his authority to maintain peace.” Id. at
399–400.
    213 287 U.S. at 400–01. This holding has been ignored by states on numerous

occasions. E.g., Allen v. Oklahoma City, 175 Okla. 421, 52 P.2d 1054 (1935); Hearon
v. Calus, 178 S.C. 381, 183 S.E. 13 (1935); and Joyner v. Browning, 30 F. Supp. 512
(W.D. Tenn. 1939).
    214 31 Stat. 141, 153 (1900).
