     Articles of War: World War II Crimes.—As a matter of fact,
in General Yamashita’s case,223 which was brought after the termi-
nation of hostilities for alleged “war crimes,” the Court abandoned
its restrictive conception altogether. In the words of Justice Rutledge’s
dissenting opinion in this case: “The difference between the Court’s
view of this proceeding and my own comes down in the end to the
view, on the one hand, that there is no law restrictive upon these
proceedings other than whatever rules and regulations may be pre-
scribed for their government by the executive authority or the mili-
tary and, on the other hand, that the provisions of the Articles of
War, of the Geneva Convention and the Fifth Amendment ap-
ply.” 224 And the adherence of the United States to the Charter of
London in August 1945, under which the Nazi leaders were brought
to trial, is explicable by the same theory. These individuals were
charged with the crime of instigating aggressive war, which at the
time of its commission was not a crime either under international
law or under the laws of the prosecuting governments. It must be
presumed that the President is not in his capacity as Supreme Com-
mander bound by the prohibition in the Constitution of ex post facto
laws, nor does international law forbid ex post facto laws.225
     Articles of War: Response to the Attacks of September 11,
2001.—In response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on
New York City’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washing-
ton, D.C., Congress passed the “Authorization for Use of Military
Force,” 226 which provided that the President may use “all neces-
sary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the
terrorist attacks [or] harbored such organizations or persons.” Dur-
ing a military action in Afghanistan pursuant to this authoriza-
tion, a United States citizen, Yaser Hamdi, was taken prisoner. The
Executive Branch argued that it had plenary authority under Ar-
ticle II to hold such an “enemy combatant” for the duration of hos-
tilities, and to deny him meaningful recourse to the federal courts.
In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Court agreed that the President was
authorized to detain a United States citizen seized in Afghanistan,
although a majority of the Court appeared to reject the notion that
such power was inherent in the Presidency, relying instead on statu-
the meaning of the Hague Convention and the law of war.”). See also Colepaugh v.
Looney, 235 F.2d 429, 432 (10th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 1014 (1957) (“[T]he
petitioner’s citizenship in the United States does not . . . confer upon him any con-
stitutional rights not accorded any other belligerent under the laws of war.”).
