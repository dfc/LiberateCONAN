times to designate a definite eligibility, thereby virtually usurping
the appointing power.506 Despite the record of the past, however, it
is not at all clear that Congress may cabin the President’s discre-
tion, at least for offices that he considers important, by, for ex-
ample, requiring him to choose from lists compiled by others. To be
sure, there are examples, but they are not free of ambiguity.507
    But when Congress contrived actually to participate in the ap-
pointment and administrative process and provided for selection of
the members of the Federal Election Commission, two by the Presi-
dent, two by the Senate, and two by the House, with confirmation
of all six members vested in both the House and the Senate, the
Court unanimously held the scheme to violate the Appointments
Clause and the principle of separation of powers. The term “officers
of the United States” is a substantive one requiring that any appoin-
tions and jurisdiction, fix the terms of office, and prescribe reasonable and relevant
qualifications and rules of eligibility of appointees, always provided “that the quali-
fications do not so limit selection and so trench upon executive choice as to be in
effect legislative designation.” Id. at 128–29. For reiteration of Congress’s general
powers, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 134–35 (1976); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S.
654, 673–77 (1988). See also United States v. Ferreira, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 40, 51 (1851).
      506 See data in E. Corwin, supra at 363–65. Congress has repeatedly designated

individuals, sometimes by name, more frequently by reference to a particular office,
for the performance of specified acts or for posts of a nongovernmental character;
e.g., to paint a picture (Johnathan Trumbull), to lay out a town, to act as Regents of
Smithsonian Institution, to be managers of Howard Institute, to select a site for a
post office or a prison, to restore the manuscript of the Declaration of Independence,
to erect a monument at Yorktown, to erect a statue of Hamilton, and so on and so
forth. Note, Power of Appointment to Public Office under the Federal Constitution,
42 HARV. L. REV. 426, 430–31 (1929). In his message of April 13, 1822, President Mon-
roe stated that, “as a general principle, . . . Congress have [sic] no right under the
Constitution to impose any restraint by law on the power granted to the President
so as to prevent his making a free selection of proper persons for these [newly cre-
ated] offices from the whole body of his fellow-citizens.” 2 J. Richardson supra at
698, 701. The statement is ambiguous, but its apparent intention is to claim for the
President unrestricted power in determining who are proper persons to fill newly
created offices. See the distinction drawn in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52,
128–29 (1926), quoted supra. And note that in Public Citizen v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 482–89 (1989) (concurring), Justice Kennedy suggested the
President has sole and unconfined discretion in appointing).
      507 The Sentencing Commission, upheld in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S.

361 (1989), numbered among its members three federal judges; the President was
to select them “after considering a list of six judges recommended to the President
by the Judicial Conference of the United States.” Id. at 397 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 991(a)).
The Comptroller General is nominated by the President from a list of three individu-
als recommended by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President
pro tempore of the Senate. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 727 (1986) (citing 31
U.S.C. § 703(a)(2)). In Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the
Abatement of Airport Noise, 501 U.S. 252, 268–69 (1991), the Court carefully distin-
guished these examples from the particular situation before it that it condemned,
but see id. at 288 (Justice White dissenting), and in any event it never actually passed
on the list devices in Mistretta and Synar. The fault in Airports Authority was not
the validity of lists generally, the Court condemning the device there as giving Con-
gress control of the process, in violation of Buckley v. Valeo.
