equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice
President.
    Clause 4. The Congress may determine the Time of chusing
the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes;
which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
                              ELECTORAL COLLEGE
           The electoral college was one of the compromises by which the
       delegates were able to agree on the document finally produced. “This
       subject,” said James Wilson, referring to the issue of the manner
       in which the President was to be selected, “has greatly divided the
       House, and will also divide people out of doors. It is in truth the
       most difficult of all on which we have had to decide.” 68 Adoption of
       the electoral college plan came late in the Convention, which had
       previously adopted on four occasions provisions for election of the
       executive by the Congress and had twice defeated proposals for elec-
       tion by the people directly.69 Itself the product of compromise, the
       electoral college probably did not work as any member of the Con-
       vention could have foreseen, because the development of political
       parties and nomination of presidential candidates through them and
       designation of electors by the parties soon reduced the concept of
       the elector as an independent force to the vanishing point in prac-
       tice if not in theory.70 But the college remains despite numerous
       efforts to adopt another method, a relic perhaps but still a signifi-
       cant one. Clause 3 has, of course, been superceded by the Twelfth
       Amendment.

       “Appoint”
           The word “appoint” as used in Clause 2 confers on state legisla-
       tures “the broadest power of determination.” 71 Upholding a state

       THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT: THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND THE DIRECT-VOTE
       ALTERNATIVE (1968). The second presidential election, in 1792, saw the first party in-
       fluence on the electors, with the Federalists and the Jeffersonians organizing to con-
       trol the selection of the Vice-President. Justice Jackson once noted: “As an institu-
       tion the Electoral College suffered atrophy almost indistinguishable from rigor mortis.”
