    Sometimes the nature of a treaty will determine whether it re-
quires legislative execution or “conveys an intention that it be ‘self-
executing’ and is ratified on these terms.” 343 One authority states
that whether a treaty is self-executing “depends upon whether the
obligation is imposed on private individuals or on public authori-
ties. . . .”
     “Treaty provisions which define the rights and obligations of pri-
vate individuals and lay down general principles for the guidance
of military, naval or administrative officials in relation thereto are
usually considered self-executing. Thus treaty provisions assuring
aliens equal civil rights with citizens, defining the limits of na-
tional jurisdiction, and prescribing rules of prize, war and neutral-
ity, have been so considered . . . .”
    “On the other hand certain treaty obligations are addressed solely
to public authorities, of which may be mentioned those requiring
the payment of money, the cession of territory, the guarantee of ter-
ritory or independence, the conclusion of subsequent treaties on de-
scribed subjects, the participation in international organizations, the
collection and supplying of information, and direction of postal, tele-
graphic or other services, the construction of buildings, bridges, light-
houses, etc.” 344 It may well be that these two characteristics merge
with each other at many points and the language of the Court is
not always helpful in distinguishing them.345
     Treaties and the Necessary and Proper Clause.—What power,
or powers, does Congress exercise when it enacts legislation for the
purpose of carrying treaties of the United States into effect? When
the subject matter of the treaty falls within the ambit of Con-
gress’s enumerated powers, then it is these powers that it exercises
in carrying the treaty into effect. But if the treaty deals with a sub-
ject that falls within the national jurisdiction because of its interna-
tional character, then recourse is had to the Necessary and Proper
Clause. Thus, of itself, Congress would have had no power to con-
fer judicial powers upon foreign consuls in the United States, but
the treaty-power can do this and has done it repeatedly and Con-
gress has supplemented these treaties by appropriate legisla-
