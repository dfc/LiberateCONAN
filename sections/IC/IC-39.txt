between the source of limited supplies and the consumers. From
the viewpoint of a rationing system a middleman who distributes
the product in violation and disregard of the prescribed quotas is
an inefficient and wasteful conduit. . . . Certainly we could not say
that the President would lack the power under this Act to take away
from a wasteful factory and route to an efficient one a precious sup-
ply of material needed for the manufacture of articles of war. . . .
From the point of view of the factory owner from whom the materi-
als were diverted the action would be harsh. . . . But in times of
war the national interest cannot wait on individual claims to pref-
erence. . . . Yet if the President has the power to channel raw ma-
terials into the most efficient industrial units and thus save scarce
materials from wastage it is difficult to see why the same principle
is not applicable to the distribution of fuel oil.” 143 Sanctions were,
therefore, constitutional when the deprivations they wrought were
a reasonably implied amplification of the substantive power which
they supported and were directly conservative of the interests which
this power was created to protect and advance. It is certain, how-
ever, that sanctions not uncommonly exceeded this pattern.144
     The Postwar Period.—The end of active hostilities did not ter-
minate either the emergency or the Federal Government’s response
to it. President Truman proclaimed the termination of hostilities on
December 31, 1946,145 and, in July 1947, Congress enacted a joint
resolution that repealed a great variety of wartime statutes and set
termination dates for others.146 Signing the resolution, the Presi-
dent said that the emergencies declared in 1939 and 1940 contin-
ued to exist and that it was “not possible at this time to provide
for terminating all war and emergency powers.” 147 The hot war was
giving way to the Cold War.
    Congress thereafter enacted a new Housing and Rent Act to con-
tinue the controls begun in 1942 148 and continued the military draft.149
With the outbreak of the Korean War, legislation was enacted estab-
lishing general presidential control over the economy again,150 and
by executive order the President created agencies to exercise the
power.151 The Court continued to assume the existence of a state of
wartime emergency prior to Korea, but with misgivings. In Woods
