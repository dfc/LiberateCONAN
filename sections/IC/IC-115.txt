tee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United
States be appointed in the manner prescribed by the Appointments
Clause.508 The Court did hold, however, that the Commission so ap-
pointed and confirmed could be delegated the powers Congress it-
self could exercise, that is, those investigative and informative func-
tions that congressional committees carry out were properly vested
in this body.
     Congress is authorized by the Appointments Clause to vest the
appointment of “inferior Officers,” at its discretion, “in the Presi-
dent alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.”
The principal questions arising under this portion of the clause are
“Who are ‘inferior officers,’ ” and “what are the ‘Departments’ ” whose
heads may be given appointing power? 509 “[A]ny appointee exercis-
ing significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States
is an ‘Officer of the United States,’ and must, therefore, be ap-
pointed in the manner prescribed by § 2, cl. 2, of [Article II].” 510
“The Constitution for purposes of appointment very clearly divides
all its officers into two classes. The primary class requires a nomi-
nation by the President and confirmation by the Senate. But fore-
seeing that when offices became numerous, and sudden removals
necessary, this mode might be inconvenient, it was provided that,
in regard to officers inferior to those specially mentioned, Congress
might by law vest their appointment in the President alone, in the
courts of law, or in the heads of departments. That all persons who
can be said to hold an office under the government about to be es-
tablished under the Constitution were intended to be included within
one or the other of these modes of appointment there can be but
little doubt.” 511
     508 Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109–143 (1976). The Court took pains to ob-

serve that the clause was violated not only by the appointing process but by the
confirming process, inclusion of the House of Representatives, as well. Id. at 137.

     509 Concurrently, of course, although it may seem odd, the question of what is a

“Court[] of Law” for purposes of the Appointments Clause is unsettled. See Freytag
v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991) (Court divides 5-to-4 whether an Article I court
is a court of law under the clause).
     510 Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S.868, 881 (1991) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo,

424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976)).
     511 United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 509–510 (1879) (quoted in Buckley

v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 125 (1976)). The constitutional definition of an “inferior” officer
is wondrously imprecise. See Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 880–882 (1991);
Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 670–73 (1988). See also United States v. Eaton,
169 U.S. 331 (1898). There is another category, of course, employees, but these are
lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States. Ordinarily, the term
“employee” denotes one who stands in a contractual relationship to her employer,
but here it signifies all subordinate officials of the Federal Government receiving
their appointments at the hands of officials who are not specifically recognized by
