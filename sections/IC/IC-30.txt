                                     OATH OF OFFICE
             What is the time relationship between a President’s assump-
        tion of office and his taking the oath? Apparently, the former comes
        first, this answer appearing to be the assumption of the language
        of the clause. The Second Congress assumed that President Wash-
        ington took office on March 4, 1789,107 although he did not take
        the oath until the following April 30.
            That the oath the President is required to take might be consid-
        ered to add anything to the powers of the President, because of his
        obligation to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” might
        appear to be rather a fanciful idea. But in President Jackson’s mes-
        sage announcing his veto of the act renewing the Bank of the United
        States there is language which suggests that the President has the
        right to refuse to enforce both statutes and judicial decisions based
        on his own independent decision that they were unwarranted by
        the Constitution.108 The idea next turned up in a message by Presi-
        dent Lincoln justifying his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus
        without obtaining congressional authorization.109 And counsel to Presi-
        dent Johnson during his impeachment trial adverted to the theory,
        but only in passing.110 Beyond these isolated instances, it does not
        appear to be seriously contended that the oath adds anything to
        the President’s powers.

    SECTION 2. Clause 1. The President shall be Commander in
Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the
Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Ser-
vice of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writ-
ing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Depart-
ments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective
Office, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons
for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Im-
peachment.

        Jackson’s Cabinet had drafted the message, later repudiated this possible reading
        of the message. 2 C. WARREN, THE SUPREME COURT IN UNITED STATES HISTORY 223–224
