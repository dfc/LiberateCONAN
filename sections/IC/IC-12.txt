egated powers doctrine.31 The holding in Kent v. Dulles 32 that del-
egation to the Executive of discretion in the issuance of passports
must be measured by the usual standards applied in domestic del-
egations appeared to circumscribe Justice Sutherland’s more expan-
sive view, but the subsequent limitation of that decision, though for-
mally reasoned within its analytical framework, coupled with language
addressed to the President’s authority in foreign affairs, leaves clouded
the vitality of that decision.33 The case nonetheless remains with
Myers v. United States the source and support of those contending
for broad inherent executive powers.34
     The Youngstown Case.—The only modern case that has exten-
sively considered the “inherent” powers of the President or the is-
sue of what executive powers are vested by the first section of Ar-
ticle II 35 is Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,36 and its multiple

     31 E.g., Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 25 (1942) (Chief Justice Stone); Reid v. Co-

vert, 354 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1957) (plurality opinion, per Justice Black).
     32 357 U.S. 116, 129 (1958).
     33 Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981). For the reliance on Curtiss-Wright, see id.

at 291, 293–94 & n.24, 307–08. But see Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654,
659–62 (1981), qualified by id. at 678. Compare Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988)
(construing National Security Act as not precluding judicial review of constitutional
challenges to CIA Director’s dismissal of employee, over dissent relying in part on
Curtiss-Wright as interpretive force counseling denial of judicial review), with De-
partment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) (denying Merit Systems Protec-
tion Board authority to review the substance of an underlying security-clearance de-
termination in reviewing an adverse action and noticing favorably President’s inherent
power to protect information without any explicit legislative grant). In Loving v. United
States, 517 U.S. 748 (1996), the Court recurred to the original setting of Curtiss-
Wright, a delegation to the President without standards. Congress, the Court found,
had delegated to the President authority to structure the death penalty provisions
of military law so as to bring the procedures, relating to aggravating and mitigating
factors, into line with constitutional requirements, but Congress had provided no
standards to guide the presidential exercise of the authority. Standards were not
required, held the Court, because his role as Commander-in-Chief gave him respon-
sibility to superintend the military establishment and Congress and the President
had interlinked authorities with respect to the military. Where the entity exercising
the delegated authority itself possesses independent authority over the subject mat-
ter, the familiar limitations on delegation do not apply. Id. at 771–74.
     34 That the opinion “remains authoritative doctrine” is stated in L. HENKIN, FOR-

EIGN AFFAIRS AND THE CONSTITUTION 25–26 (1972). It is used as an interpretive prec-
edent in AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE, RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW, THE FOREIGN RELA-
TIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES see, e.g., §§ 1, 204, 339 (1987). The Restatement is
circumspect, however, about the reach of the opinion in controversies between presi-
dential and congressional powers.
     35 The issue is implicit in several of the opinions of the Justices in New York

Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971). See id. at 727, 728–30 (Justice Stew-
art concurring), 752, 756–59 (Justice Harlan dissenting). Assertions of inherent power
to sustain presidential action were made in Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654
(1981), but the Court studiously avoided these arguments in favor of a somewhat
facile statutory analysis. Separation-of-powers analysis informed the Court’s deci-
sions in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), Nixon v. Administrator of Gen-
eral Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977),Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), and Har-
