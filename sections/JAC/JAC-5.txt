ment and is thus enforceable against the states.19 Relevant to this
question, the Court examined whether the right to keep and bear
arms is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” 20 or “deeply
rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition”.21 The Court, relying
on historical analysis set forth previously in Heller, noted the Eng-
lish common law roots of the right to keep arms for self-defense 22
and the importance of the right to the American colonies, the draft-
ers of the Constitution, and the states as a bulwark against over-
reaching federal authority.23 Noting that by the 1850s the per-
ceived threat that the National Government would disarm the citizens
had largely faded, the Court suggested that the right to keep and
bear arms became valued principally for purposes of self-defense,
so that the passage of Fourteenth Amendment, in part, was in-
tended to protect the right of ex-slaves to keep and bear arms. While
it was argued by the dissent that this protection would most logi-
cally be provided by the Equal Protection Clause, not by the Due
Process Clause,24 the plurality also found enough evidence of then-
existent concerns regarding the treatment of blacks by the state mi-
litia to conclude that the right to bear arms was also intended to
protect against generally-applicable state regulation.




     19 The portion of the opinion finding incorporation was authored by Justice Alito,

and joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy. Justice Thomas
declined to join the plurality’s opinion as regards incorporation under the Due Pro-
cess Clause. Instead, Justice Thomas, alone among the Justices, would have found
that the Second Amendment is applicable to the states under the Privileges or Im-
munities Clause. For a more detailed discussion of incorporation and the Privileges
or Immunities Clause, see supra Bill of Rights, Fourteenth Amendment and Four-
teenth Amendment, Privileges or Immunities.
