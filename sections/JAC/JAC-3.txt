    After that decision, Congress placed greater limitations on the
receipt, possession, and transportation of firearms,8 and proposals
for national registration or prohibition of firearms altogether have
been made.9 Miller, however, shed little light on the validity of such
proposals. Pointing out that interest in the “character of the Sec-
ond Amendment right has recently burgeoned,” Justice Thomas, con-
curring in the Court’s invalidation (on other grounds) of the Brady
Handgun Violence Prevention Act, questioned whether the Second
Amendment bars federal regulation of gun sales, and suggested that
the Court might determine “at some future date . . . whether Jus-
tice Story was correct . . . that the right to bear arms has justly
been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.’ ” 10
    It was not until 2008 that the Supreme Court definitively came
down on the side of an “individual rights” theory. Relying on new
scholarship regarding the origins of the Amendment,11 the Court in
District of Columbia v. Heller 12 confirmed what had been a grow-
ing consensus of legal scholars—that the rights of the Second Amend-
ment adhered to individuals. The Court reached this conclusion af-
ter a textual analysis of the Amendment,13 an examination of the
historical use of prefatory phrases in statutes, and a detailed explo-
ration of the 18th century meaning of phrases found in the Amend-
ment. Although accepting that the historical and contemporaneous
use of the phrase “keep and bear Arms” often arose in connection
(11th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1007 (1997) (member of Georgia unorganized mili-
tia unable to establish that his possession of machine guns and pipe bombs bore
any connection to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia).
     8 Enacted measures include the Gun Control Act of 1968. 82 Stat. 226, 18 U.S.C.

§§ 921–928. The Supreme Court’s dealings with these laws have all arisen in the
context of prosecutions of persons purchasing or obtaining firearms in violation of
prohibitions against such conduct by convicted felons. Lewis v. United States, 445
U.S. 55 (1980); Barrett v. United States, 423 U.S. 212 (1976); Scarborough v. United
States, 431 U.S. 563 (1977); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971).

ies § 1890, p. 746 (1833)). Justice Scalia, in extra-judicial writing, has sided with
the individual rights interpretation of the Amendment. See ANTONIN SCALIA, A MATTER
OF INTERPRETATION, FEDERAL COURTS AND THE LAW, 136–37 n.13 (A. Gutmann, ed., 1997)
(responding to Professor Tribe’s critique of “my interpretation of the Second Amend-
ment as a guarantee that the Federal Government will not interfere with the indi-
vidual’s right to bear arms for self-defense”).
