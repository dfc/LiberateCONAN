                               BEARING ARMS


                         SECOND AMENDMENT
     A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of
a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall
not be infringed.

                                    IN GENERAL
            For over 200 years, despite extensive debate and much legisla-
       tive action with respect to regulation of the purchase, possession,
       and transportation of firearms, as well as proposals to substan-
       tially curtail ownership of firearms, there was no definitive resolu-
       tion by the courts of just what right the Second Amendment pro-
       tects. The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts:
       its prefatory clause (“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to
       the security of a free State”) and its operative clause (“the right of
       the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed”). To per-
       haps oversimplify the opposing arguments, the “states’ rights” the-
       sis emphasized the importance of the prefatory clause, arguing that
       the purpose of the clause was to protect the states in their author-
       ity to maintain formal, organized militia units. The “individual rights”
       thesis emphasized the operative clause, so that individuals would
       be protected in the ownership, possession, and transportation of fire-
       arms.1 Whatever the Amendment meant, it was seen as a bar only
       to federal action, not state 2 or private 3 restraints.
