    One of the Second Amendment cases that the Court has heard,
and until recently the only case challenging a congressional enact-
ment, seemed to affirm individual protection but only in the con-
text of the maintenance of a militia or other such public force. In
United States v. Miller,4 the Court sustained a statute requiring reg-
istration under the National Firearms Act of sawed-off shotguns.
After reciting the original provisions of the Constitution dealing with
the militia, the Court observed that “[w]ith obvious purpose to as-
sure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such
forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were
made. It must be interpreted with that end in view.” 5 The signifi-
cance of the militia, the Court continued, was that it was composed
of “civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.” It was upon this force
that the states could rely for defense and securing of the laws, on a
force that “comprised all males physically capable of acting in con-
cert for the common defense,” who, “when called for service . . . were
expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the
kind in common use at the time.” 6 Therefore, “[i]n the absence of
any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a ‘shotgun
having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length’ at this time has
some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a
well-regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment
guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Cer-
tainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part
of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute
to the common defense.” 7

     4 307 U.S. 174 (1939). The defendants had been released on the basis of the

trial court determination that prosecution would violate the Second Amendment and
no briefs or other appearances were filed on their behalf; the Court acted on the
basis of the government’s representations.
     5 307 U.S. at 178.
     6 307 U.S. at 179.
     7 307 U.S. at 178. In Cases v. United States, 131 F.2d 916, 922 (1st Cir. 1942),

cert. denied, 319 U.S. 770 (1943), the court, upholding a similar provision of the
Federal Firearms Act, said, “Apparently, then, under the Second Amendment, the
Federal Government can limit the keeping and bearing of arms by a single indi-
vidual as well as by a group of individuals, but it cannot prohibit the possession or
use of any weapon which has any reasonable relationship to the preservation or ef-
ficiency of a well-regulated militia.” See Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 65 n.8
(1980) (dictum: Miller holds that the “Second Amendment guarantees no right to
keep and bear a firearm that does not have ‘some reasonable relationship to the
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia’ ”). See also Hickman v. Block,
81 F.3d 98 (9th Cir.) (plaintiff lacked standing to challenge denial of permit to carry
concealed weapon, because Second Amendment is a right held by states, not by pri-
vate citizens), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 912 (1996); United States v. Gomez, 92 F.3d
770, 775 n.7 (9th Cir. 1996) (interpreting federal prohibition on possession of fire-
arm by a felon as having a justification defense “ensures that [the provision] does
not collide with the Second Amendment”). United States v. Wright, 117 F.3d 1265
