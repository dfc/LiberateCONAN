ment. Not until it was confronted with the Child Labor Law, which
prohibited the transportation in interstate commerce of goods pro-
duced in establishments in which child labor was employed, did the
Court hold that the state police power was an obstacle to adoption
of a measure which operated directly and immediately upon inter-
state commerce. In Hammer v. Dagenhart,19 five members of the
Court found in the Tenth Amendment a mandate to nullify this law
as an unwarranted invasion of the reserved powers of the states.
This decision was expressly overruled in United States v. Darby.20
     During the twenty years following Hammer v. Dagenhart, a va-
riety of measures designed to regulate economic activities, directly
or indirectly, were held void on similar grounds. Excise taxes on
the profits of factories in which child labor was employed,21 on the
sale of grain futures on markets which failed to comply with fed-
eral regulations,22 on the sale of coal produced by nonmembers of a
coal code established as a part of a federal regulatory scheme,23 and
a tax on the processing of agricultural products, the proceeds of which
were paid to farmers who complied with production limitations im-
posed by the Federal Government,24 were all found to invade the
reserved powers of the states. In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
States,25 the Court, after holding that the commerce power did not
extend to local sales of poultry, cited the Tenth Amendment to re-
fute the argument that the existence of an economic emergency jus-
tified the exercise of what Chief Justice Hughes called “extraconstitutional
authority.” 26
     In 1941, the Court came full circle in its exposition of the Tenth
Amendment. Having returned four years earlier to the position of
John Marshall when it sustained the Social Security Act 27 and the
National Labor Relations Act,28 the Court explicitly restated Mar-
shall’s thesis in upholding the Fair Labor Standards Act in United
States v. Darby.29 Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice
Stone wrote: “The power of Congress over interstate commerce ‘is
complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and ac-
