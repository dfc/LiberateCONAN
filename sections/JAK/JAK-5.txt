In 1939, Collector v. Day was expressly overruled.11 Nevertheless,
the problem of reconciling state and national interest still con-
fronts the Court occasionally, and was elaborately considered in New
York v. United States,12 where, by a vote of six-to-two, the Court
upheld the right of the United States to tax the sale of mineral wa-
ters taken from property owned by a state. Speaking for four mem-
bers of the Court, Chief Justice Stone justified the tax on the ground
that “[t]he national taxing power would be unduly curtailed if the
State, by extending its activities, could withdraw from it subjects
of taxation traditionally within it.” 13 Justices Frankfurter and Rutledge
found in the Tenth Amendment “no restriction upon Congress to in-
clude the States in levying a tax exacted equally from private per-
sons upon the same subject matter.” 14 Justices Douglas and Black
dissented, saying: “If the power of the Federal Government to tax
the States is conceded, the reserved power of the States guaran-
teed by the Tenth Amendment does not give them the indepen-
dence which they have always been assumed to have.” 15
    Federal Police Power.—A year before Collector v. Day was de-
cided, the Court held invalid, except as applied in the District of
Columbia and other areas over which Congress has exclusive au-
thority, a federal statute penalizing the sale of dangerous illuminat-
ing oils.16 The Court did not refer to the Tenth Amendment. In-
stead, it asserted that the “express grant of power to regulate
commerce among the States has always been understood as lim-
ited by its terms; and as a virtual denial of any power to interfere
with the internal trade and business of the separate States; except,
indeed, as a necessary and proper means for carrying into execu-
tion some other power expressly granted or vested.” 17 Similarly, in
the Employers’ Liability Cases,18 an act of Congress making every
carrier engaged in interstate commerce liable to “any” employee, in-
cluding those whose activities related solely to intrastate activities,
for injuries caused by negligence, was held unconstitutional by a
closely divided Court, without explicit reliance on the Tenth Amend-

enue Service is authorized to sue a state auditor personally and recover from him
an amount equal to the accrued salaries which, after having been served with no-
tice of levy, he paid to state employees delinquent in their federal income tax. Sims
