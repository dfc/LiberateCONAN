strained” consideration of “the limits that the state-federal balance
places on Congress’s powers,” a plain statement rule was all the
more necessary. “[I]nasmuch as this Court in Garcia has left primar-
ily to the political process the protection of the States against intru-
sive exercises of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers, we must be
absolutely certain that Congress intended such an exercise.” 70
     The Court’s 1992 decision in New York v. United States 71 may
portend a more direct retreat from Garcia. The holding in New York,
that Congress may not “commandeer” state regulatory processes by
ordering states to enact or administer a federal regulatory pro-
gram, applied a limitation on congressional power previously recog-
nized in dictum 72 and in no way inconsistent with the holding in
Garcia. Language in the opinion, however, seems more reminiscent
of National League of Cities than of Garcia. First, the Court’s opin-
ion by Justice O’Connor declares that it makes no difference whether
federalism constraints derive from limitations inherent in the Tenth
Amendment, or instead from the absence of power delegated to Con-
gress under Article I; “the Tenth Amendment thus directs us to de-
termine . . . whether an incident of state sovereignty is protected
by a limitation on an Article I power.” 73 Second, the Court, without
reference to Garcia, thoroughly repudiated Garcia’s “structural” ap-
proach requiring states to look primarily to the political processes
for protection. In rejecting arguments that New York’s sovereignty
could not have been infringed because its representatives had par-
ticipated in developing the compromise legislation and had con-
sented to its enactment, the Court declared that “[t]he Constitu-
tion does not protect the sovereignty of States for the benefit of the
States or State governments, [but instead] for the protection of in-
dividuals.” Consequently, “State officials cannot consent to the en-
largement of the powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in
the Constitution.” 74 The stage appears to be set, therefore, for some
relaxation of Garcia’s obstacles to federalism-based challenges to leg-
islation enacted pursuant to the commerce power.
