tinguishing National League of Cities, the Court and dissenters wrote
as if the Tenth Amendment was the prohibition.57 Whatever the source
of the constraint, it was held not to limit the exercise of power un-
der the Reconstruction Amendments.58
     The Court overruled National League of Cities in Garcia v. San
Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority.59 Justice Blackmun’s opin-
ion for the Court in Garcia concluded that the National League of
Cities test for “integral operations in areas of traditional governmen-
tal functions” had proven “both impractical and doctrinally bar-
ren,” and that the Court in 1976 had “tried to repair what did not
need repair.” 60 With only passing reference to the Tenth Amend-
ment, the Court nonetheless clearly reverted to the Madisonian view
of the Amendment reflected in United States v. Darby.61 States re-
tain a significant amount of sovereign authority “only to the extent
that the Constitution has not divested them of their original pow-
ers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government.” 62 The
principal restraints on congressional exercise of the commerce power
are to be found not in the Tenth Amendment or in the Commerce
Clause itself, but in the structure of the Federal Government and
in the political processes.63 “Freestanding conceptions of state sov-
ereignty” such as the National League of Cities test subvert the fed-
eral system by “invit[ing] an unelected federal judiciary to make
decisions about which state policies it favors and which ones it dis-
likes.” 64 Although continuing to recognize that “Congress’s author-
ity under the Commerce Clause must reflect [the] position . . . that
the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitu-

ing); id. at 775 (Justice O’Connor dissenting); EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226 (1983).
The EEOC Court distinguished National League of Cities, holding that application
of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to state fish and game wardens did
not directly impair the state’s ability to structure integral operations in areas of tra-
ditional governmental function, since the state remained free to assess each war-
den’s fitness on an individualized basis and retire those found unfit for the job.

ion of Chief Justice Burger).

Blackmun’s qualified acceptance of the National League of Cities approach having
changed to complete rejection.

the Court in Garcia, 469 U.S. at 549.

     63 “Apart from the limitation on federal authority inherent in the delegated na-

ture of Congress’s Article I powers, the principal means chosen by the Framers to
ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the structure of the Fed-
eral Government itself.” 469 U.S. at 550. The Court cited the role of states in select-
ing the President, and the equal representation of states in the Senate. Id. at 551.
