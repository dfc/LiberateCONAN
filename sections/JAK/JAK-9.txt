whether those persons are violating state law, and imposes severe

    Federal Regulations Affecting State Activities and Instru-
mentalities.—Since the mid-1970s, the Court has been closely di-
vided over whether the Tenth Amendment or related constitutional
doctrine constrains congressional authority to subject state activi-
ties and instrumentalities to generally applicable requirements en-
acted pursuant to the commerce power.49 According to Garcia v. San
Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,50 the Tenth Amendment im-
poses practically no judicially enforceable limit on generally appli-
cable federal legislation, and states must look to the political pro-
cess for redress. Garcia, however, like National League of Cities v.
Usery,51 the case it overruled, was a 5–4 decision, and there are
later indications that the Court may be ready to resurrect some form
of Tenth Amendment constraint on Congress.52
     In National League of Cities v. Usery, the Court conceded that
the legislation under attack, which regulated the wages and hours
of certain state and local governmental employees, was “undoubt-
edly within the scope of the Commerce Clause,” 53 but it cautioned
that “there are attributes of sovereignty attaching to every state
government which may not be impaired by Congress, not because
Congress may lack an affirmative grant of legislative authority to
reach the matter, but because the Constitution prohibits it from ex-
ercising the authority in that manner.” 54 The Court approached but
did not reach the conclusion that the Tenth Amendment was the
prohibition here, not that it directly interdicted federal power be-
cause power which is delegated is not reserved, but that it implic-
itly embodied a policy against impairing the states’ integrity or abil-
ity to function.55 But, in the end, the Court held that the legislation
was invalid, not because it violated a prohibition found in the Tenth
Amendment or elsewhere, but because the law was “not within the
authority granted Congress.” 56 In subsequent cases applying or dis-
