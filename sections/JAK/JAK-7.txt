knowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Consti-
tution.’ . . . That power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by
the exercise or non-exercise of state power. . . . It is no objection to
the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its
exercise is attended by the same incidents which attended the exer-
cise of the police power of the states. . . . Our conclusion is unaf-
fected by the Tenth Amendment which . . . states but a truism that
all is retained which has not been surrendered.” 30
    But even prior to 1937 not all federal statutes promoting objec-
tives which had traditionally been regarded as the responsibilities
of the states had been held invalid. In Hamilton v. Kentucky Distill-
eries Co.,31 a unanimous Court, in an opinion by Justice Brandeis,
upheld “War Prohibition,” saying, “That the United States lacks the
police power, and that this was reserved to the States by the Tenth
Amendment, is true. But it is nonetheless true that when the United
States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitu-
tion, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exer-
cise may be attended by the same incidents which attend the exer-
cise by a State of its police power.” 32 And, in a series of cases that
today seems irreconcilable with Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Court
sustained federal laws penalizing the interstate transportation of
lottery tickets,33 of women for immoral purposes,34 of stolen auto-
mobiles,35 and of tick-infected cattle,36 as well as a statute prohib-
iting the mailing of obscene matter.37 It affirmed the power of Con-
gress to punish the forgery of bills of lading purporting to cover
interstate shipments of merchandise,38 to subject prison-made goods
moved from one state to another to the laws of the receiving state,39
to regulate prescriptions for the medicinal use of liquor as an appro-
priate measure for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amend-
ment,40 and to control extortionate means of collecting and attempt-
ing to collect payments on loans, even when all aspects of the credit
transaction took place within one state’s boundaries.41 More re-
cently, the Court upheld provisions of federal surface mining law
