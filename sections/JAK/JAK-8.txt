that could be characterized as “land use regulation” traditionally
subject to state police power regulation.42
    In 1995, reversing this trend, the Court in United States v. Lo-
pez 43 struck down a statute prohibiting possession of a gun at or
near a school, rejecting an argument that possession of firearms in
school zones can be punished under the Commerce Clause because
it impairs the functioning of the national economy. Acceptance of
this rationale, the Court said, would eliminate “a[ny] distinction be-
tween what is truly national and what is truly local,” would con-
vert Congress’s commerce power into “a general police power of the
sort retained by the States,” and would undermine the “first prin-
ciple” that the Federal Government is one of enumerated and lim-
ited powers.44 Application of the same principle led five years later
to the Court’s decision in United States v. Morrison 45 invalidating
a provision of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that cre-
ated a federal cause of action for victims of gender-motivated vio-
lence. Congress may not regulate “non-economic, violent criminal
conduct based solely on that conduct’s aggregate effect on inter-
state commerce,” the Court concluded. “[W]e can think of no better
example of the police power, which the Founders denied the Na-
tional Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression
of violent crime and vindication of its victims.” 46
    Notwithstanding these federal inroads into powers otherwise re-
served to the states, the Court has held that Congress could not
itself undertake to punish a violation of state law; in United States
v. Constantine,47 a grossly disproportionate excise tax imposed on
retail liquor dealers carrying on business in violation of local law
was held unconstitutional. However, Congress does not contravene
reserved state police powers when it levies an occupation tax on all
persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers regardless of

one person to deprive another of equal accommodations at inns, theaters or public
conveyances, was found to exceed the powers conferred on Congress by the Thir-
teenth and Fourteenth Amendments and hence to be an unlawful invasion of the
powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S.

Cases has been greatly modified if not severely impaired. Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer
