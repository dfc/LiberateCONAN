    Extending the principle applied in New York, the Court in Printz
v. United States 75 held that Congress may not “circumvent” the pro-
hibition on commandeering a state’s regulatory processes “by con-
scripting the State’s officers directly.” 76 Printz struck down interim
provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act that re-
quired state and local law enforcement officers to conduct back-
ground checks on prospective handgun purchasers. “The Federal Gov-
ernment may neither issue directives requiring the States to address
particular problems, nor command the States’ officers . . . to admin-
ister or enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether
policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the bur-
dens or benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally
incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.” 77
    In Reno v. Condon,78 the Court distinguished New York and Printz
in upholding the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA), a
federal law that restricts the disclosure and resale of personal infor-
mation contained in the records of state motor vehicles depart-
ments. The Court returned to a principle articulated in South Caro-
lina v. Baker that distinguishes between laws that improperly seek
to control the manner in which states regulate private parties, and
those that merely regulate state activities directly.79 Here, the Court
found that the DPPA “does not require the States in their sover-
eign capacities to regulate their own citizens,” but rather “regu-
lates the States as the owners of databases.” 80 The Court saw no
need to decide whether a federal law may regulate the states exclu-
sively, because the DPPA is a law of general applicability that regu-
lates private resellers of information as well as states.81
