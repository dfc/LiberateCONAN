     7 The Fifteenth Amendment was proposed by Congress on February 26, 1869, when it passed

the Senate, CONG. GLOBE (40th Cong., 3rd Sess.) 1641, having previously passed the House on
February 25. Id., 1563, 1564. It appears officially in 15 Stat. 346 under the date of February 27,
1869. Ratification was probably completed on February 3, 1870, when the legislature of the twenty-
eighth State (Iowa) approved the amendment, there being then 37 States in the Union. How-
ever, New York had prior to that date “withdrawn” its earlier assent to this amendment. Even
if this withdrawal were effective, Nebraska’s ratification on February 17, 1870, authorized Sec-
retary of State Fish’s certification of March 30, 1870, that the Fifteenth Amendment had be-
come a part of the Constitution. 16 Stat. 1131.
     The several state legislatures ratified the Fifteenth Amendment on the following dates: Ne-
vada, March 1, 1869; West Virginia, March 3, 1869; North Carolina, March 5, 1869; Louisiana,
March 5, 1869 (date on which it was “approved” by the Governor); Illinois, March 5, 1869; Michi-
gan, March 5, 1869; Wisconsin, March 5, 1869; Maine, March 11, 1869; Massachusetts, March
12, 1869; South Carolina, March 15, 1869; Arkansas, March 15, 1869; Pennsylvania, March 25,

Hampshire, July 1, 1869; Virginia, October 8, 1869; Vermont, October 20, 1869; Alabama, No-
vember 16, 1869; Missouri, January 7, 1870 (Missouri had ratified the first section of the 15th

amendment); Minnesota, January 13, 1870; Mississippi, January 17, 1870; Rhode Island, Janu-
ary 18, 1870; Kansas, January 19, 1870 (Kansas had by a defectively worded resolution previ-
ously ratified this amendment on February 27, 1869); Ohio, January 27, 1870 (after having re-
jected the amendment on May 4, 1869); Georgia, February 2, 1870; Iowa, February 3, 1870;
Nebraska, February 17, 1870; Texas, February 18, 1870; New Jersey, February 15, 1871 (after

1869). The amendment was rejected (and was not subsequently ratified) by Kentucky, Mary-
land, and Tennessee. California ratified this amendment in 1962 and Oregon in 1959.
