     1 In Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U.S. 368 (1921), the Supreme Court stated that it would take judi-

cial notice of the date on which a State ratified a proposed constitutional amendment. Accord-
ingly the Court consulted the State journals to determine the dates on which each house of the
legislature of certain States ratified the Eighteenth Amendment. It, therefore, follows that the
date on which the governor approved the ratification, or the date on which the secretary of
state of a given State certified the ratification, or the date on which the Secretary of State of
the United States received a copy of said certificate, or the date on which he proclaimed that
the amendment had been ratified are not controlling. Hence, the ratification date given in the
following notes is the date on which the legislature of a given State approved the particular
amendment (signature by the speaker or presiding officers of both houses being considered a
part of the ratification of the “legislature”). When that date is not available, the date given is
that on which it was approved by the governor or certified by the secretary of state of the par-
ticular State. In each case such fact has been noted. Except as otherwise indicated information
as to ratification is based on data supplied by the Department of State.
     2 Brackets enclosing an amendment number indicate that the number was not specifically

assigned in the resolution proposing the amendment. It will be seen, accordingly, that only the
Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Amendments were thus technically ratified by
number. The first ten amendments along with two others that were not ratified were proposed
by Congress on September 25, 1789, when they passed the Senate, having previously passed
the House on September 24 (1 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 88, 913). They appear officially in 1 Stat. 97.
Ratification was completed on December 15, 1791, when the eleventh State (Virginia) approved
these amendments, there being then 14 States in the Union.
     The several state legislatures ratified the first ten amendments to the Constitution on the
following dates: New Jersey, November 20, 1789; Maryland, December 19, 1789; North Caro-
lina, December 22, 1789; South Carolina, January 19, 1790; New Hampshire, January 25, 1790;
Delaware, January 28, 1790; New York, February 27, 1790; Pennsylvania, March 10, 1790; Rhode
Island, June 7, 1790; Vermont, November 3, 1791; Virginia, December 15, 1791. The two amend-
ments that then failed of ratification prescribed the ratio of representation to population in the
House, and specified that no law varying the compensation of members of Congress should be
effective until after an intervening election of Representatives. The first was ratified by ten States
(one short of the requisite number) and the second, by six States; subsequently, this second
proposal was taken up by the States in the period 1980–1992 and was proclaimed as ratified as
of May 7, 1992. Connecticut, Georgia, and Massachusetts ratified the first ten amendments in
1939.
