     3 The Eleventh Amendment was proposed by Congress on March 4, 1794, when it passed

the House, 4 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 477, 478, having previously passed the Senate on January 14,
Id., 30, 31. It appears officially in 1 Stat. 402. Ratification was completed on February 7, 1795,
when the twelfth State (North Carolina) approved the amendment, there being then 15 States
in the Union. Official announcement of ratification was not made until January 8, 1798, when
President John Adams in a message to Congress stated that the Eleventh Amendment had been
adopted by three-fourths of the States and that it “may now be deemed to be a part of the
Constitution.” In the interim South Carolina had ratified, and Tennessee had been admitted
into the Union as the sixteenth State.
     The several state legislatures ratified the Eleventh Amendment on the following dates: New
York, March 27, 1794; Rhode Island, March 31, 1794; Connecticut, May 8, 1794; New Hamp-
shire, June 16, 1794; Massachusetts, June 26, 1794; Vermont, between October 9 and Novem-
ber 9, 1794; Virginia, November 18, 1794; Georgia, November 29, 1794; Kentucky, December 7,
1794; Maryland, December 26, 1794; Delaware, January 23, 1795; North Carolina, February 7,
1795; South Carolina, December 4, 1797.
     4 The Twelfth Amendment was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803, when it passed

the House, 13 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 775, 776, having previously passed the Senate on December
2. Id., 209. It was not signed by the presiding officers of the House and Senate until December
12. It appears officially in 2 Stat. 306. Ratification was probably completed on June 15, 1804,
when the legislature of the thirteenth State (New Hampshire) approved the amendment, there
being then 17 States in the Union. The Governor of New Hampshire, however, vetoed this act
of the legislature on June 20, and the act failed to pass again by two-thirds vote then required
by the state constitution. Inasmuch as Article V of the Federal Constitution specifies that amend-
ments shall become effective “when ratified by legislatures of three-fourths of the several States
or by conventions in three-fourths thereof,” it has been generally believed that an approval or
veto by a governor is without significance. If the ratification by New Hampshire be deemed
ineffective, then the amendment became operative by Tennessee’s ratification on July 27, 1804.
On September 25, 1804, in a circular letter to the Governors of the several States, Secretary of
State Madison declared the amendment ratified by three-fourths of the States.
     The several state legislatures ratified the Twelfth Amendment on the following dates: North
Carolina, December 22, 1803; Maryland, December 24, 1803; Kentucky, December 27, 1803; Ohio,
between December 5 and December 30, 1803; Virginia, between December 20, 1803 and Febru-
ary 3, 1804; Pennsylvania, January 5, 1804; Vermont, January 30, 1804; New York, February
10, 1804; New Jersey, February 22, 1804; Rhode Island, between February 27 and March 12,
1804; South Carolina, May 15, 1804; Georgia, May 19, 1804; New Hampshire, June 15, 1804;
and Tennessee, July 27, 1804. The amendment was rejected by Delaware on January 18, 1804,
and by Connecticut at its session begun May 10, 1804. Massachusetts ratified this amendment
in 1961.
