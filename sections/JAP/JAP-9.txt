the theory that Congress impliedly had power to protect the enjoy-
ment of every right conferred by the Constitution against depriva-
tion from any source.33 In James v. Bowman,34 however, the Court
held that legislation based on the Fifteenth Amendment that at-
tempted to prohibit private as well as official interference with the
right to vote on racial grounds was unconstitutional. That interpre-
tation was not questioned until 1941.35 But the Court’s interpreta-
tion of the “state action” requirement in cases brought under § 1 of
the Fifteenth Amendment narrowed the requirement there and opened
the possibility, when these decisions are considered with cases de-
cided under the Fourteenth Amendment, that Congress is not lim-
ited to legislation directed to official discrimination.36
     Thus, in Smith v. Allwright, 37 the exclusion of African-
Americans from political parties without the compulsion or sanc-
tion of state law was nonetheless held to violate the Fifteenth Amend-
ment because political parties were so regulated otherwise as to be
in effect agents of the state and thus subject to the Fifteenth Amend-
ment; additionally, in one passage the Court suggested that the fail-
ure of the state to prevent the racial exclusion might be the act
implicating the Amendment.38 Then, in Terry v. Adams,39 the politi-
cal organization was not regulated by the state at all and selected
its candidates for the Democratic primary election by its own pro-
cesses; all eligible white voters in the jurisdiction were members of
the organization but African-Americans were excluded. Neverthe-
less, the Court held that this exclusion violated the Fifteenth Amend-
     33 The idea was fully spelled out in Justice Bradley’s opinion on circuit in United

States v. Cruikshank, 25 Fed. Cas. 707, 712, 713 (No. 14,897) (C.C.D. La. 1874).
The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 555–56
(1876), and United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 217–18 (1876), may be read to sup-
port the contention. Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884), involved a federal elec-
tion and the assertion of congressional power to reach private interference with the
right to vote in federal elections, but the Court went further to broadly state the
power of Congress to protect the citizen in the exercise of rights conferred by the
Constitution, among which was the right to be free from discrimination in voting
protected by the Fifteenth Amendment. Id. at 665–66.

     38 “The United States is a constitutional democracy. Its organic law grants to

all citizens a right to participate in the choice of elected officials without restrictions
by any State because of race. This grant to the people of the opportunity for choice
is not to be nullified by a State through casting its electoral process in a form which
permits a private organization to practice racial discrimination in the election. Con-
stitutional rights would be of little value if they could be thus indirectly denied.”
