The 1960 Civil Rights Act 48 expanded on this authorization by per-
mitting the Attorney General to seek a court finding of “pattern or
practice” of discrimination in any particular jurisdiction and autho-
rizing upon the entering of such a finding the registration of all
qualified persons in the jurisdiction of the race discriminated against
by court-appointed referees. This authorization moved the vindica-
tion of voting rights beyond a case-by-case process. Further amend-
ments were added in 1964.49
     Finally, in the Voting Rights Act of 1965,50 Congress went sub-
stantially beyond what it had done before. It provided that if the
Attorney General determined that any state or political subdivi-
sion maintained on November 1, 1964, any “test or device” and that
less than 50 per cent of the voting age population in that jurisdic-
tion was registered on November 1, 1964, or voted in the 1964 presi-
dential election, such tests or devices were to be suspended for five
years and no person should be denied the right to vote on the basis
of such a test or device.51 Aimed primarily at literacy tests,52 the
Act was considerably broadened through the Court’s interpretation
of § 5,53 which requires the approval of either the Attorney General
or a three-judge court in the District of Columbia before a state
could put into effect any new voting qualification or prerequisite to
voting or new standard, practice, or procedure with respect to vot-
ing. Thus, preclearance became required for changes such as appor-
tionment and districting, adoption of at-large instead of district elec-
tions, candidate qualification regulations, provisions for assistance
of illiterate voters, movement of polling places, adoption of appoint-
ive instead of elective positions, annexations, and public employer
restrictions upon employees running for elective office.54 A state could
reinstitute such a test or device within the prescribed period only
by establishing in a three-judge court in the District of Columbia
that the test or device did not have a discriminatory intent or ef-
fect and the covered jurisdiction could only change its election laws

ing any educational achievement or knowledge, (3) demonstrating good moral char-
acter, (4) proving qualifications by vouching of registered voters.
