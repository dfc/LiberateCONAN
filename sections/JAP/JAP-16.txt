     In Shelby County, the Court characterized § 5 preclearance as
an “extraordinary departure from the traditional course of rela-
tions between the States and the Federal Government” and as “ex-
traordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.”
This led the Court to find the formula in § 4 violative of the “funda-
mental principle of equal sovereignty” among states.74 While the sig-
nificance of a principle of equal sovereignty had been considered and
rejected by the Court in a previous challenge to the act,75 the Court
in Shelby County held that the principle “remains highly pertinent
in assessing subsequent disparate treatment of States.” 76 The Court
went on to find that there was insufficient justification for the dis-
parate treatment, as “[v]oter turnout and registration rates [in those
jurisdictions] now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory eva-
sions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold of-
fice at unprecedented levels.” 77
     The dissent, referencing the lenient standard for congressional
enforcement legislation established under Katzenbach, closely exam-
ined the legislative record developed by Congress in the 2006 reau-
thorization of the act. The dissent noted the high number of changes
to voting practices which had been submitted by covered jurisdic-
tions under the Voting Rights Act and which had not received pre-
clearance and the high number of successful voting rights chal-
lenges in those jurisdictions under § 2 of the act.78 The dissent also
suggested that, regardless of improved minority voting participa-
tion, “second-generation barriers” which diluted minority voting power
were still prevalent in the covered jurisdictions. These barriers in-
cluded redrawing legislative districts to segregate the races, adopt-
ing at-large voting to limit the effect of minority’s votes, and dis-
criminatory annexation, such as incorporating majority white areas
into city limits to decrease the effect of black voting.79

    75 See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 328–329. Considering the dis-

parate treatment of states under the § 5 preclearance requirement, the Katzenbach
Court had referenced the case of Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559 (1911), which upheld
the authority of Oklahoma to move its state capitol despite language to the con-
trary in the enabling act providng for its admission as a state. This case, while based
on the theory that the United States “was and is a union of States, equal in power,
dignity and authority,” 221 U.S. at 580, was distinguished by the Katzenbach Court
as concerning only the admission of new states, and not remedies for actions occur-
ing subsequent to that event.
