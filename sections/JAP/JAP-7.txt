to deny equal protection .Voter qualifications 19 But an Alabama con-

both its object and its intended administration were to disenfran-

     Racial Gerrymandering.—The Court’s series of decisions in-
terpreting the Equal Protection Clause as requiring the apportion-
ment and districting of state legislatures solely on the basis of popu-
lation 21 had its beginning in Gomillion v. Lightfoot,22 in which the
Court found a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment in the redraw-
ing of a municipal boundary line into a 28-sided figure that ex-
cluded from the city all but four or five of 400 African-Americans
but no whites, and that thereby continued white domination of mu-
nicipal elections. Subsequent decisions, particularly concerning the
validity of multi-member districting and alleged dilution of minor-
ity voting power, were decided under the Equal Protection Clause,23
and, in City of Mobile v. Bolden,24 in the course of a considerably
divided decision with respect to the requirement of discriminatory
motivation in Fifteenth Amendment cases,25 a plurality of the Court
sought to restrict the Fifteenth Amendment to cases in which there
is official denial or abridgment of the right to register and vote, and
to exclude indirect dilution claims.26 Congressional amendment of

ties” in the Fourteenth Amendment, supra. On the plurality’s view, see 446 U.S. at
61–65. Justice White appears clearly to agree that purposeful discrimination is a
necessary component of equal protection clause violation, and may have agreed as
well that the same requirement applies under the Fifteenth Amendment. Id. at 94–
103. Only Justice Marshall unambiguously adhered to the view that discriminatory
effect is sufficient. Id. at 125. See also Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 146–49
& nn.3–5 (1976) (dissenting).
     26 446 U.S. at 65. At least three Justices disagreed with this view and would

apply the Fifteenth Amendment to vote dilution claims. Id. at 84 n.3 (Justice Ste-
vens concurring), 102 (Justice White dissenting), 125–35 (Justice Marshall dissent-
ing). The issue was reserved in Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 619 n.6 (1982).
