willing to settle for an amendment merely proscribing racial quali-
fications in determining who could vote under any other standards
the states wished to have.4 The latter group ultimately prevailed.
    The Judicial View of the Amendment.—In its initial apprais-
als of this Amendment, the Supreme Court appeared disposed to
emphasize only its purely negative aspects. “The Fifteenth Amend-
ment,” it announced, did “not confer the right . . . [to vote] upon
any one,” but merely “invested the citizens of the United States with
a new constitutional right which is . . . exemption from discrimina-
tion in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color,
or previous condition of servitude.” 5 But in subsequent cases, the
Court, conceding “that this article” has originally been construed
as giving “no affirmative right to the colored man to vote” and as
having been “designed primarily to prevent discrimination against
him,” professed to be able “to see that under some circumstances it
may operate as the immediate source of a right to vote. In all cases
where the former slave-holding States had not removed from their
Constitutions the words ‘white man’ as a qualification for voting,
this provision did, in effect, confer on him the right to vote, be-
cause . . . it annulled the discriminating word white, and this left
him in the enjoyment of the same right as white persons. And such
would be the effect of any future constitutional provision of a State
which would give the right of voting exclusively to white people. . . .” 6
    Although “the immediate concern of the Amendment was to guar-
antee to the emancipated slaves the right to vote,” the Amendment
“is cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the particular
controversy,” and “grants protection to all persons, not just mem-
bers of a particular race.” 7 Moreover, the Court has construed “race”
broadly to comprehend classifications based on ancestry as well as
those based on race.8 “Ancestry can be a proxy for race,” the Court
has explained, finding such a proxy in Hawaii’s limitation of the
right to vote in a statewide election for an office responsible for ad-
