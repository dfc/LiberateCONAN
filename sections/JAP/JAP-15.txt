unlike § 5, applies nationwide.67 As enacted in 1965, § 2 largely tracked
the language of the Fifteenth Amendment itself. In City of Mobile
v. Bolden,68 a majority of the Court agreed that the Fifteenth Amend-
ment and § 2 of the Act were coextensive, but the Justices did not
agree on the meaning to be ascribed to the statute. A plurality be-
lieved that, because the constitutional provision reached only pur-
poseful discrimination, § 2 was similarly limited. A major purpose
of Congress in 1982 had been to set aside this possible interpreta-
tion and to provide that any electoral practice “which results in a
denial or abridgement” of the right to vote on account of race or
color will violate the Act.69 The subsequent Court adoption, or re-
adoption, of the standards by which it can be determined when a
practice denies or abridges the right to vote, though couched in terms
of proving intent or motivation, may well bring the constitutional
and statutory standards into such close agreement that the consti-
tutional question will not arise.70
     The decision in Shelby County v. Holder 71 resulted in a signifi-
cant retrenchment of the application of the Voting Rights Act. In
Shelby County, the Court overturned § 4 of the act, which specifies
the formula by which it is determined which states or electoral dis-
tricts are required to submit electoral changes for preclearance. In
2006, Congress had reauthorized the Act for twenty-five years, pro-
viding that the preclearance requirement extended to jurisdictions
that had a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration
or turnout as of 1972.72 In 2009, the Court signaled in dicta that
this formula no longer served as an accurate characterization of vot-
ing conditions in the jurisdictions specified.73

     67 Private parties may bring suit to challenge electoral practices under § 2. It

provided, before the 1982 amendments, that “[n]o voting qualification or prerequi-
site to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by
any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the
United States to vote on account of race or color.”

     69 In § 3 of the 1982 amendments, § 2 of the Act was amended by the insertion

of the quoted phrase and the addition of a section setting out a nonexclusive list of
factors making up a totality of circumstances test by which a violation of § 2 would
be determined. 96 Stat. 134, amending 42 U.S. § 1973. Without any discussion of
the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986),
interpreted and applied the “totality of the circumstances” test in the context of mul-
timember districting.
