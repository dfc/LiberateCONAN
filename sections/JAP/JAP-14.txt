gress to enact enforcement legislation that was rationally related
to the end sought and that was not prohibited by it but was consis-
tent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, even though the
actual practice outlawed or restricted would not be judicially found
to violate the Fifteenth Amendment. In so acting, Congress could
prohibit state action that perpetuated the effect of past discrimina-
tion, or that, because of the existence of past purposeful discrimina-
tion, raised a risk of purposeful discrimination that might not lend
itself to judicial invalidation. “It is clear, then, that under § 2 of
the Fifteenth Amendment Congress may prohibit practices that in
and of themselves do not violate § 1 of the Amendment, so long as
the prohibitions attacking racial discrimination in voting are ‘appro-
priate,’ as that term is defined in McCulloch v. Maryland and Ex
parte Virginia . . . . Congress could rationally have concluded that,
because electoral changes by jurisdictions with a demonstrable his-
tory of intentional racial discrimination in voting create the risk of
purposeful discrimination, it was proper to prohibit changes that
have a discriminatory impact.” 65
    City of Rome is highly significant for the validity of congressio-
nal additions to the Voting Rights Act. In 1975 and 1982, Congress
extended and revised the Act to increase its effectiveness,66 and the
1982 Amendments were addressed to revitalizing § 2 of the Act, which,

     65 City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 177 (1980). Justices Powell,

Rehnquist, and Stewart dissented. Id. at 193, 206. In Lopez v. Monterey County,
525 U.S. 266 (1999), the Court reiterated its prior holdings that Congress may exer-
cise its enforcement power based on discriminatory effects, and without any finding
of discriminatory intent.
     66 The 1975 amendments, Pub. L. 94–73, 89 Stat. 400, extended the Act for seven

years, expanded it to include those areas having minorities distinguished by their
language, i.e., “persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives
or of Spanish heritage,” § 207, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 1(c)(3), in which certain statistical
tests are met and requiring election materials be provided in the language(s) of the
group(s), and enlarged to require bilingual elections if more than five percent of the
voting age citizens of a political subdivision are members of a single language minor-
ity group whose illiteracy rate is higher than the national rate. The 1982 amend-
ments, Pub. L. 97–205, 96 Stat. 131, in addition to the § 2 revision, alter after Au-
gust 5, 1984, the provisions by which a covered jurisdiction may take itself from
under the Act by proving to the special court in the District of Columbia that it has
complied with the Act for the previous ten years and that it has taken positive steps
both to encourage minority political participation and to remove structural barriers
to minority electoral influence. Moreover, the amendments change the result in Beer
v. United States, 425 U.S. 130 (1976), in which the Court had held that a covered
jurisdiction was precluded from altering a voting practice only if the change would
lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities; even if the change was
only a little ameliorative of existing discrimination, the jurisdiction could imple-
ment it. The 1982 amendments provide that the change may not be approved if it
would “perpetuate voting discrimination,” in effect applying the new § 2 results test
to preclearance procedures. S. REP. NO. 417, 97th Congress, 2d Sess. 12 (1982); H.R.
