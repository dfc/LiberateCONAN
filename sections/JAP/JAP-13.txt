been registered while both literate and illiterate African-Americans
had not been; it could require the states to seek federal permission
to reinstitute old tests or to institute new ones; and it could pro-
vide for federal examiners to register qualified voters.
     The nearly unanimous decision affords Congress a vast amount
of discretion to enact measures designed to enforce the Amend-
ment through broad affirmative prescriptions rather than through
proscriptions of specific practices.59 Subsequent decisions confirm the
reach of this power. In one case, the Court held that evidence of
discrimination in the educational opportunities available to black
children in the county as compared to that available to white chil-
dren during the period in which most of the adults who were now
potential voters were in school precluded a North Carolina county
from reinstituting a literacy test because of the past educational
discrimination.60 And, in 1970, when Congress 61 suspended for a
five-year period literacy tests throughout the nation, the Court unani-
mously sustained the action as a valid measure to enforce the Fif-
teenth Amendment.62
     Moreover, in City of Rome v. United States,63 the Court read
even more broadly the scope of Congress’s remedial powers under
§ 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, paralleling the similar reasoning
under § 5 of the Fourteenth. The jurisdiction sought to escape from
coverage of the Voting Rights Act by showing that it had not uti-
lized any discriminatory practices within the prescribed period. The
lower court had found that the City had engaged in practices with-
out any discriminatory motive, but that its practices had had a dis-
criminatory impact. The City thus argued that, because the Fif-
teenth Amendment reached only purposeful discrimination, the Act’s
proscription of effect as well as purpose went beyond Congress’s power.
The Court held, however, that even if discriminatory intent was a
prerequisite to finding a violation of § 1 of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment by the courts,64 Congress had the authority to go beyond that
and proscribe electoral devices that had the effect of discriminat-
ing.
     The Court held that § 2, like § 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment, was in effect a “necessary and proper clause” enabling Con-
    59 Justice Black dissented from that portion of the decision that upheld the re-

quirement that before a state could change its voting laws it must seek approval of
the Attorney General or a federal court. 383 U.S. at 355.
