§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act may obviate the further development
of constitutional jurisprudence in this area, however.27

Congressional Enforcement
    Although the Fifteenth Amendment is “self-executing,” 28 the Court
early emphasized that the right granted to be free from racial dis-
crimination “should be kept free and pure by congressional enact-
ment whenever that is necessary.” 29 Following ratification of the Fif-
teenth Amendment in 1870, Congress passed the Enforcement Act
of 1870,30 which had started out as a bill to prohibit state officers
from restricting suffrage on racial grounds and providing criminal
penalties and ended up as a comprehensive measure aimed as well
at private action designed to interfere with the rights guaranteed
under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Insofar as this
legislation reached private action, it was largely nullified by the Su-
preme Court and the provisions aimed at official action proved inef-
fectual and much of it was later repealed.31 More recent legislation
has been much more far-reaching in this respect and has been sus-
tained.
    State Action.—Like § 1 of the Fourteenth, § 1 of the Fifteenth
Amendment prohibits official denial of the rights therein guaran-
teed, giving rise to the “state action” doctrine.32 Nevertheless, the
Supreme Court in two early cases seemed to be of the opinion that
Congress could protect the rights against private deprivation, on

amending 42 U.S.C. § 1973. The Supreme Court interpreted the 1982 amendments
to section 2 in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), determining that Congress
had effectively overruled the City of Mobile intent standard in returning to a “total-
ity of the circumstances” results test.

PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS: QUEST FOR A SWORD 35–55 (1947), for a brief history of the
enactment and repeal of the statutes. The surviving statutes of this period are 18
U.S.C. §§ 241–42, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971(a), 1983, and 1985(3).
     32 See “State Action,” under the Fourteenth Amendment, supra. “The State . . .

must mean not private citizens but those clothed with the authority and influence
which official position affords. The application of the prohibition of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment to ‘any State’ is translated by legal jargon to read ‘State action.’ This phrase
gives rise to a false direction in that it implies some impressive machinery or delib-
erative conduct normally associated with what orators call a sovereign state. The
vital requirement is State responsibility—that somewhere, somehow, to some ex-
tent, there be an infusion of conduct by officials, panoplied with State power, into
any scheme by which colored citizens are denied voting rights merely because they
are colored.” Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 473 (1953) (Justice Frankfurter concur-
ring).
