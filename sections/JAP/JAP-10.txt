ment, although a majority of the Justices did not agree on a ratio-
nale for the holding. Four of them thought the case simply
indistinguishable from Smith v. Allwright, and they therefore did
not deal with the central issue.40 Justice Frankfurter thought the
participation of local elected officials in the processes of the organi-
zation was sufficient to implicate state action.41 Three Justices thought
that when a purportedly private organization is permitted by the
state to assume the functions normally performed by an agency of
the state, then that association is subject to federal constitutional
restrictions,42 but this opinion also, in citing selected passages of
Yarbrough and Reese and Justice Bradley’s circuit opinion in
Cruikshank, appeared to be suggesting that the state action require-
ment is not indispensable.43 The 1957 Civil Rights Act 44 included a
provision prohibiting private action with intent to intimidate or co-
erce persons in respect of voting in federal elections and autho-
rized the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief against such pri-
vate actions regardless of the character of the election. The 1965
Voting Rights Act 45 went further and prohibited and penalized pri-
vate actions to intimidate voters in federal, state, or local elections.
The Supreme Court has yet to consider the constitutionality of these
sections.
    Federal Remedial Legislation.—The history of federal reme-
dial legislation is of modern vintage.46 The 1957 Civil Rights Act 47
authorized the Attorney General of the United States to seek injunc-
tive relief to prevent interference with the voting rights of citizens.

away with the state action requirement. Id. at 485 (dissenting).
     44 71 Stat. 637, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971(b), 1971(c). In a suit to enjoin state officials

from violating 42 U.S.C. § 1971(a), derived from Rev. Stat. 2004, applying to all elec-
tions, the defendants challenged the constitutionality of the law because it applied
to private action as well as state. The Court held that inasmuch as the statute could
constitutionally be applied to the defendants it would not hear their contention that
as applied to others it would be void. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 (1960),

     46 The 1871 Act, ch. 99, 16 Stat. 433, provided for a detailed federal supervision

of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. It was re-
pealed in 1894. ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36. In Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), the Court,
in an opinion by Justice Holmes, refused to order the registration of 6,000 African-
Americans who alleged that they were being wrongly denied the franchise, the Court
observing that no judicial order would do them any good in the absence of judicial
supervision of the actual voting, which it was not prepared to do, and suggesting
that the petitioners apply to Congress or the President for relief.
