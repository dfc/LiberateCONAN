    The White Primary.—The Court displayed indecision, how-
ever, when it was called upon to deal with the exclusion of African-
Americans from participation in primary elections. Prior to its be-
coming convinced that primary contests were in fact elections to which
federal constitutional guarantees applied,12 the Court had relied upon
the Equal Protection Clause to strike down the Texas White Pri-
mary Law 13 as well as a later Texas statute that contributed to a
similar exclusion by limiting voting in primary elections to mem-
bers of state political parties as determined by the central commit-
tees of such parties.14 When exclusion of African-Americans was there-
after perpetuated by political parties not acting in obedience to any
statutory command, this discrimination was for a time viewed as
not constituting state action and therefore as not prohibited by ei-
ther the Fourteenth or the Fifteenth Amendments.15 This holding
was reversed nine years later when the Court declared that, where
the selection of candidates for public office is entrusted by statute
to political parties, a political party in making its selection at a pri-
mary election is a state agency, and consequently may not under
the Fifteenth Amendment exclude African-Americans from such elec-
tions.16 An effort by South Carolina to escape the effects of this rul-
ing by repealing all statutory provisions regulating primary elec-
tions and political organizations conducting them was nullified by
a lower federal court with no doctrinal difficulty,17 but the Su-
preme Court, although nearly unanimous on the result, was un-
able to come to a majority agreement with regard to the exclusion
of African-Americans by the Jaybird Association, a countywide or-
ganization that, independently of state laws and the use of state
election machinery or funds, nearly monopolized access to Demo-
cratic nomination for local offices. The exclusionary policy was held
unconstitutional but there was no opinion of the Court.18
    Literacy Tests.—At an early date the Court held that literacy
tests that are drafted so as to apply alike to all applicants for the
voting franchise would be deemed to be fair on their face and in
the absence of proof of discriminatory enforcement could not be said
