toric line separating the province of the jury from that of the judge,
without at the same time preventing procedural improvement that
does not transgress this line. Elucidating this formula, the Court
has concluded that it is constitutional for a federal judge, in the
course of trial, (1) to express his opinion upon the facts, provided
that all questions of fact are ultimately submitted to the jury,52 (2)
to call the jury’s attention to parts of the evidence that he deems of
special importance,53 being careful to distinguish between matters
of law and matters of opinion,54 (3) to inform the jury, when there
is not sufficient evidence to justify a verdict, that such is the case,55
(4) to require a jury to answer specific interrogatories in addition
to rendering a general verdict,56 (5) to direct the jury, after the plain-
tiff’s case is all in, to return a verdict for the defendant on the ground
of the insufficiency of the evidence,57 (6) to set aside a verdict that
is against the law or the evidence, and to order a new trial,58 and
(7) to refuse the defendant a new trial on the condition, accepted
by plaintiff, that the plaintiff remit a portion of the damages awarded
him,59 but not, on the other hand, to deny the plaintiff a new trial
on the condition, accepted by the defendant, that the defendant con-
sent to an increase of the damage award.60 Nor can a Court of Ap-
peals reverse a jury’s finding on the issue of the reasonableness of
a stevedoring company’s conduct in failing to avert an injury to one
of its employees. The Court of Appeals had found that the steve-
dore had acted unreasonably as a matter of law, but the Supreme
Court held that, “[u]nder the Seventh Amendment, that issue should
have been left to the jury’s determination.” 61

judgment n. o. v. than when a trial court does.” A federal appellate court may also
