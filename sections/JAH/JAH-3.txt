                                 CIVIL TRIALS


                         SEVENTH AMENDMENT

    In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be pre-
served, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-
examined in any Court of the United States, than according to
the rules of the common law.

                           TRIAL BY JURY IN CIVIL CASES

       The Right and the Characteristics of the Civil Jury
            History.—On September 12, 1787, as the Convention was in
       its final stages, Mr. Williamson of North Carolina “observed to the
       House that no provision was yet made for juries in Civil cases and
       suggested the necessity of it.” The comment elicited some support
       and the further observation that because of the diversity of prac-

       is a most important and valuable amendment; and places upon the high ground of
       constitutional right the inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in civil cases, a privi-

       tial to political and civil liberty.” Id. at 1762.
