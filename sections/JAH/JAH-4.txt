posed amendment or its meaning was debated during its passage.6
    Composition and Functions of Civil Jury.—Traditionally, the
Supreme Court has treated the Seventh Amendment as preserving
the right of trial by jury in civil cases as it “existed under the Eng-
lish common law when the amendment was adopted.” 7 The right
was to “a trial by a jury of twelve men, in the presence and under
the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them on the
law and to advise them on the facts and (except in acquittal of a
criminal charge) to set aside their verdict if in his opinion it is against
the law or the evidence.” 8 Decision of the jury must be by unani-
mous verdict.9 In Colgrove v. Battin,10 however, the Court by a five-
to-four vote held that rules adopted in a federal district court au-
thorizing civil juries composed of six persons were permissible under
the Seventh Amendment and congressional enactments. By the ref-
erence in the Amendment to the “common law,” the Court thought,
“the Framers of the Seventh Amendment were concerned with pre-
serving the right of trial by jury in civil cases where it existed at
common law, rather than the various incidents of trial by jury.” 11
    The primary purpose of the Amendment is to preserve “the com-
mon law distinction between the province of the court and that of
the jury, whereby, in the absence of express or implied consent to
the contrary, issues of law are resolved by the court and issues of
      5 1 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 436 (1789). “In suits at common law, between man and

man, the trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought
to remain inviolate.”
      6 It is simply noted in 1 ANNALS OF CONGRESS 760 (1789), that on August 18 the

House “considered and adopted” the committee version: “In suits at common law,
the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.” On September 7, the SENATE JOURNAL
states that this provision was adopted after insertion of “where the consideration
exceeds twenty dollars.” 2 B. SCHWARTZ, THE BILL OF RIGHTS: A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY

Bedford, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 433, 446–48 (1830).
      8 Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 13 (1899).

U.S. 464 (1897); Springville v. Thomas, 166 U.S. 707 (1897).
      10 413 U.S. 149 (1973). Justices Marshall and Stewart dissented on constitu-

tional and statutory grounds, id. at 166, while Justices Douglas and Powell relied
only on statutory grounds without reaching the constitutional issue. Id. at 165, 188.
      11 413 U.S. at 155–56. The Court did not consider what number less than six, if

any, would fail to satisfy the Amendment’s requirements. “What is required for a
‘jury’ is a number large enough to facilitate group deliberation combined with a like-
lihood of obtaining a representative cross section of the community. . . . It is undoubt-
edly true that at some point the number becomes too small to accomplish these goals
. . . ” Id. at 160 n.16. Application of similar reasoning has led the Court to uphold
elimination of the unanimity as well as the 12-person requirement for criminal tri-
als. See Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970) (jury size); Apodaca v. Oregon, 406
U.S. 404 (1972) (unanimity); and Sixth Amendment discussion, supra, “The Attri-
butes of the Jury.”
