acted by Congress,75 and by the minority in terms of the costs to
the Supreme Court in time and effort spent in evaluating the quan-
tum of evidence necessary to create a jury question.76
     Although the considerations present in the FELA cases were not
inherently different from those in any civil case where the direc-
tion of a verdict or a decision of an issue by the court may raise
sub silentio the issue whether the Seventh Amendment right to a
jury trial has been impaired by court usurpation of the jury func-
tion, cases under the FELA, which retained the common-law require-
ments of negligence as a prerequisite to recovery, involved pecu-
liarly difficult decisions as to the adequacy of proof of negligence.
“Special and important reasons for the grant of certiorari in these
cases are certainly present,” the Court wrote in a leading case, “when
lower federal and state courts persistently deprive litigants of their
right to a jury determination.” 77 The operating test was: “Under
this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs jus-
tify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any
part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which
damages are sought. It does not matter that, from the evidence, the
jury may also with reason, on ground of probability, attribute the
result to other causes, including the employee’s contributory negli-

Black’s opinion of the Court initiated the line of cases here considered; Bailey v.
Central Vermont Ry., 319 U.S. 350 (1943); Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union Ry.,

Trial by jury is “part and parcel of the remedy afforded railroad workers” under the
FELA. Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., 319 U.S. at 354. “The difference between the
majority and minority of the Court in our treatment of FELA cases concerns the
degree of vigilance we should exercise in safeguarding the jury trial—guaranteed by
the Seventh Amendment.” Harris v. Pennsylvania R.R., 361 U.S. 15, 17 (1959) (Jus-
tice Douglas concurring). “[T]his Court is vigilant to exercise its power of review
. . . to correct instances of improper administration of the Act and to prevent its
erosion by narrow and niggardly construction.” Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R.R., 352
U.S. at 509.

furter dissenting), contains a lengthy review and critique of the Court’s practice.
