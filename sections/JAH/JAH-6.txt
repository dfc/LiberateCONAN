the “interests” of the state and federal systems can be reconciled,
however, a court should endeavor to implement the rules of the state
courts.22
    Waiver of the Right.—Parties may enter into a stipulation waiv-
ing a jury and submitting the case to the court upon an agreed state-
ment of facts, even without any legislative provision for waiver.23
Prior to adoption of the Federal Rules, Congress had, “by statute,
provided for the trial of issues of fact in civil cases by the court
without the intervention of a jury, only when the parties waive their
right to a jury by a stipulation in writing.” 24 Under the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, any party may make a timely demand for
a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving
upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing, and failure so
to serve a demand constitutes a waiver of the right.25 However, a
waiver is not to be implied from a request for a directed verdict.26

Application of the Amendment
     Cases “at Common Law”.—The coverage of the Amendment
is “limited to rights and remedies peculiarly legal in their nature,
and such as it was proper to assert in courts of law and by the
appropriate modes and proceedings of courts of law.” 27 The term
“common law” was used in contradistinction to suits in which equi-
table rights alone were recognized at the time of the framing of the
Amendment and equitable remedies were administered.28 Illustra-
tive of the Court’s course of decision on this subject are two unani-
mous decisions holding that civil juries were required, one in a suit
     22 Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415 (1996). In Gasperini,

the Court examined whether New York law, which required that state trial courts
and courts of appeals review jury awards to determine if they “deviate materially
from reasonable compensation,” should be applied by federal courts exercising diver-
sity jurisdiction. The Court, in what has been characterized as a “state-friendly” de-
cision, Leading Cases, 110 HARV. L. REV. 266 (1996), found that absent inconsistent
federal interests, the state standard of review should be applied by the federal courts.
The Court held that a district court could apply such a standard consistent with
Seventh Amendment precepts, but that the court of appeals could only review an
award under an “abuse of discretion” standard. 518 U.S. at 434–35.

though every reasonable presumption was indulged against a waiver. Hodges v. Easton,
