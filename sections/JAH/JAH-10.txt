ized as a private rather than a public right,” at least when the de-
fendant had not submitted a claim against the bankruptcy es-
tate.41
     The Continuing Law-Equity Distinction.—The use of the term
“common law” in the Amendment to indicate those cases in which
the right to jury trial was to be preserved reflected, of course, the
division of the English and United States legal systems into sepa-
rate law and equity jurisdictions, in which actions cognizable in courts
of law generally were triable to a jury whereas in equity there was
no right to a jury. In the federal court system there were unitary
courts having jurisdiction in both law and equity, but distinct law
and equity procedures, including the use or nonuse of the jury. Adop-
tion of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938 merged law
and equity into a single civil jurisdiction and established uniform
rules of procedure. Legal and equitable claims which previously had
to be brought as separate causes of action on different “sides” of
the court could now be joined in a single action, and in some in-
stances, such as compulsory counterclaims, had to be joined in one
action.42 But the traditional distinction between law and equity for
purposes of determining when there was a constitutional right to
trial by jury remained and led to some difficulty.43

the bankruptcy estate subjects himself to the bankruptcy court’s equitable power,
and is not entitled to a jury trial when subsequently sued by the bankruptcy trustee
to recover preferential monetary transfers. Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U.S. 42 (1990).

     43 Under the old equity rules, it had been held that the absolute right to a trial

of the facts by a jury could not be impaired by any blending with a claim, properly
cognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in aid of the legal action or dur-
ing its pendency. Hipp v. Babin, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 271, 278 (1857). The Seventh
Amendment was interpreted to mean that equitable and legal issues could not be
tried in the same suit, so that such aid in the federal courts had to be sought in
separate proceedings. Scott v. Neely, 140 U.S. 106, 109 (1891); Bennett v. But-
terworth, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 669 (1850); Lewis v. Cocks, 90 U.S. (23 Wall.) 466, 470
(1874); Killian v. Ebbinghaus, 110 U.S. 568, 573 (1884); Buzard v. Houston, 119 U.S.
347, 351 (1886). If an action at law evoked an equitable counterclaim, the trial judge
would order the legal issues to be separately tried after the disposition of the equity
issues. In this procedure, however, res judicata and collateral estoppel could operate
so as to curtail the litigant’s right to a jury finding on factual issues common to
both claims. But priority of scheduling was considered to be a matter of discretion.
Federal statutes prohibiting courts of the United States from sustaining suits in eq-
uity if the remedy was complete at law served to guard the right of trial by jury
and were liberally construed. Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., 287 U.S. 92, 94 (1932).
     Nor was the distinction between law and equity to be obliterated by state legis-
lation. Thompson v. Railroad Companies, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 134 (1868). So, if state
law, in advance of judgment, treated the whole proceeding upon a simple contract,
including determination of validity and of amount due, as an equitable proceeding,
it brought the case within the federal equity jurisdiction upon removal. Ascertain-
ment of plaintiff ’s demand being properly by action at law, however, the fact that
the equity court had power to summon a jury on occasion did not afford an equiva-
