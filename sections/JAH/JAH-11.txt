    This difficulty has been resolved by stressing the fundamental
nature of the jury trial right and protecting it against diminution
through resort to equitable principles. In Beacon Theatres v. Westover,44
the Court held that a district court erred in trying all issues itself
in an action in which the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment
and an injunction barring the defendant from instituting an anti-
trust action against it, and the defendant had filed a counterclaim
alleging violation of the antitrust laws and asking for treble dam-
ages. It did not matter, the Court ruled, that the equitable claims
had been filed first and the law counterclaims involved allegations
common to the equitable claims. Subsequent jury trial of these is-
sues would probably be precluded by collateral estoppel, hence “only
under the most imperative circumstances which in view of the flex-
ible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can
the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior deter-
mination of equitable claims.” 45 Then, in Dairy Queen v. Wood,46 in
which the plaintiff sought several types of relief, including an in-
junction and an accounting for money damages, the Court held that,
even though the claim for legal relief was incidental to the equi-
table relief sought, the Seventh Amendment required that the is-
sues pertaining to that legal relief be tried before a jury, because

lent of the right of trial by jury secured by the Seventh Amendment. Whitehead v.
Shattuck, 138 U.S. 146 (1891); Buzard v. Houston, 119 U.S. 347 (1886); Greeley v.
Lowe, 155 U.S. 58, 75 (1894). But where state law gave an equitable remedy, such
as to quiet title to land, the federal courts enforced it, if it did not obstruct the rights
of the parties as to trial by jury. Clark v. Smith, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 195 (1839); Hol-
land v. Challen, 110 U.S. 15 (1884); Reynolds v. Crawfordsville Bank, 112 U.S. 405
(1884); Chapman v. Brewer, 114 U.S. 158 (1885); Cummings v. National Bank, 101
U.S. 153, 157 (1879); United States v. Landram, 118 U.S. 81 (1886); More v. Steinbach,
127 U.S. 70 (1888). Cf. Ex parte Simons, 247 U.S. 321 (1918).
     By the inclusion in the Law and Equity Act of 1915 of § 274(b) of the Judicial
Code, 38 Stat. 956, the transfer of cases to the other side of the court was made
possible. The new procedure permitted legal questions arising in an equity action to
be determined therein without sending the case to the law side. This section also
permitted equitable defenses to be interposed in an action at law. The same order
was preserved as under the system of separate courts. The equitable issues were
disposed of first, and if a legal issue remained, it was triable by a jury. Enelow v.
New York Life Ins. Co., 293 U.S. 379 (1935). See also Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Bank,
260 U.S. 235 (1922). There was no provision for legal counterclaims in an equitable
action, for the reason that Equity Rule 30, requiring the answer to a bill in equity
to state any counterclaim arising out of the same transaction, was not intended to
change the line between law and equity and was construed as referring to equitable
counterclaims only. American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., 260 U.S. 360, 364
(1922); Stamey v. United States, 37 F.2d 188 (W.D. Wash. 1929). Equitable jurisdic-
tion existing at the time of the filing of the bill was not disturbed by the subsequent
availability of legal remedies, and the scheduling was discretionary. American Life
Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 300 U.S. 203 (1937).
     44 359 U.S. 500 (1959).
     45 359 U.S. at 510–11.
     46 369 U.S. 469 (1962).
