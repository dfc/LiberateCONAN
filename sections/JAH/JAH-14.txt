    “In numerous contexts, gatekeeping judicial determinations pre-
vent submission of claims to a jury’s judgment without violating the
Seventh Amendment.” 62 Thus, in order to screen out frivolous com-
plaints or defenses, Congress “has power to prescribe what must
be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has the power to determine
what must be proved to prevail on the merits. It is the federal law-
maker’s prerogative, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the con-
tours of—including the pleading and proof requirements for . . . pri-
vate actions.” 63 A “heightened pleading rule simply ‘prescribes the
means of making an issue,’ and . . . , when ‘[t]he issue [is] made as
prescribed, the right of trial by jury accrues.’ ” 64
     Directed Verdicts.—In 1913, in Slocum v. New York Life Ins.
Co.,65 the Court held that a federal appeals court lacked authority
to order the entry of a judgment contrary to the verdict in a case
in which the federal trial court should have directed a verdict for
one party, but the jury had found for the other party contrary to
the evidence; the only course open to either court was to order a
new trial. Although plainly in accordance with the common law as
it stood in 1791, the five-to-four decision was subjected to a heavy
barrage of professional criticism based on convenience and urging
recognition of capacity for growth in the common law.66 Slocum was
then impaired, if not completely undermined, by subsequent hold-
ings.67
    In the first of these cases, the Court held that a trial court had
the right to enter a judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict of the
jury after having reserved decision on a motion by the defendant
for dismissal on the ground of insufficient evidence.68 The Court dis-
tinguished Slocum and noted that its ruling qualified some of its

review a district court’s denial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive under
an abuse of discretion standard. Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S.
415 (1996) (New York law that requires appellate courts to order a new trial when a
jury award “deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation” may
be applied by a federal district court exercising diversity jurisdiction, “with appel-
late control of the trial court’s ruling limited to review for ‘abuse of discretion’ ”).

peals court affirms liability but orders the level of damages to be reconsidered, the
plaintiff has a Seventh Amendment right either to accept the reduced award or to
have a new trial).
