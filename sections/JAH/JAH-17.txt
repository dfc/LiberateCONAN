employer played any part at all in the injury or death.” Similar is-
sues have arisen under such statutes as the Jones Act 78 and the
Safety Appliance Act.79
    “Judges are to fix their sights primarily to make that appraisal
and, if that test is met, are bound to find that a case for the jury is
made out whether or not the evidence allows the jury a choice of
other probabilities.” 80 A persistent dissent in the line of cases ex-
pressed the fear that in FELA cases “anything that a jury says goes,
with the consequences that all meaningful judicial supervision over
jury verdicts in such cases has been put at an end. . . . If so, . . .
the time has come when the Court should frankly say so. If not,
then the Court should at least give expression to the standards by
which the lower courts are to be guided in these cases.” 81

Appeals From State Courts to the Supreme Court
    The clause of the Amendment prohibiting the re-examination
of any fact found by a jury is not restricted in its application to
suits at common law tried before juries in courts of the United States.
It applies equally to cases tried before a jury in a state court and
brought to the Supreme Court on appeal.82 The Court has indi-
cated frequently, however, that, in cases involving a claim of a de-
nial of constitutional rights, it is free to examine and review the
evidence upon which the lower court based its conclusions, a posi-
tion that under some circumstances could conflict with the prin-
ciple of jury autonomy.83
