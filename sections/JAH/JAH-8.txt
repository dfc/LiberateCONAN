there is no direct historical antecedent dating to the adoption of
the amendment, the court may also consider whether existing prec-
edent and the sound administration of justice favor resolution by
judges or juries.32
     The amendment does not apply to cases in admiralty and mari-
time jurisdiction, in which the trial is by a court without a jury,33
nor does it reach statutory proceedings unknown to the common
law, such as an application to a court of equity to enforce an order
of an administrative body.34 Thus, when Congress committed to ad-
ministrative determination the finding of a violation of the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Act with the discretion to fix a fine for a
violation, the charged party being able to obtain judicial review of
the administrative proceeding in a federal court of appeal and the
fine being collectible in a suit in federal court, the argument that
the absence of a jury trial in the process for a charged party vio-
lated the Seventh Amendment was unanimously rejected. “At least
in cases in which ‘public rights’ are being litigated—e.g., cases in
which the government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce pub-
lic rights created by statutes within the power of Congress to enact—
the Seventh Amendment does not prohibit Congress from assign-
ing the factfinding function and initial adjudication to an
administrative forum with which the jury would be incompat-
ible.” 35
    On the other hand, if Congress assigns such cases to Article III
courts, a jury may be required. In Tull v. United States,36 the Court
ruled that the Amendment requires trial by jury in civil actions to
determine liability for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act,
but not to assess the amount of penalty. The penal nature of the
Clean Water Act’s civil penalty remedy distinguishes it from restitution-
based remedies available in equity courts, and therefore makes it a
