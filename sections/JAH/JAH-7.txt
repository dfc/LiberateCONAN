by a landlord to recover possession of real property from a tenant
allegedly behind on rent, the other in a suit for damages for al-
leged racial discrimination in the rental of housing in violation of
federal law. In the former case, the Court reasoned that its Sev-
enth Amendment precedents “require[d] trial by jury in actions un-
heard of at common law, provided that the action involves rights
and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law,
rather than in an action at equity or admiralty.” 29 The statutory
cause of action, the Court found, had several counterparts in the
common law, all of which involved a right to trial by jury. In the
latter case, the plaintiff had argued that the Amendment was inap-
plicable to new causes of action created by congressional action, but
the Court disagreed. “The Seventh Amendment does apply to ac-
tions enforcing statutory rights, and requires a jury trial upon de-
mand, if the statute creates legal rights and remedies, enforceable
in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.” 30
    Omission of provision for a jury has been upheld in a number
of other cases on the ground that the suit in question was not a
suit at common law within the meaning of the Amendment, or that
the issues raised were not peculiarly legal in their nature.31 Where
recovered in an action at law. Clark v. Wooster, 119 U.S. 322, 325 (1886); Pease v.
Rathbun-Jones Eng. Co., 243 U.S. 273, 279 (1917). But see Dairy Queen v. Wood,
369 U.S. 469 (1962) (legal claims must be tried before equitable ones).
     29 Pernell v. Southall Realty Co., 416 U.S. 363 (1974).
     30 Curtis v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189, 194 (1974). “A damage action under the stat-

ute sounds basically in tort—the statute merely defines a new legal duty and autho-
rizes the court to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the defendants’
wrongful breach. . . . [T]his cause of action is analogous to a number of tort actions
recognized at common law.” Id. at 195. See also Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers
Local 391 v. Terry, 494 U.S. 558 (1990) (suit against union for back pay for breach
of duty of fair representation is a suit for compensatory damages, hence plaintiff is
entitled to a jury trial); Wooddell v. International Bhd. of Electrical Workers Local
71, 502 U.S. 93 (1991) (similar suit against union for money damages entitles union
member to jury trial; a claim for injunctive relief was incidental to the damages
claim); Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, 523 U.S. 340 (1998) (jury trial re-
quired for copyright action with close analogue at common law, even though the re-
lief sought is not actual damages but statutory damages based on what is “just”).
