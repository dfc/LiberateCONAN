assertions in Slocum.69 In the second case 70 the Court sustained a
United States district court in rejecting the defendant’s motion for
dismissal and in peremptorily directing a verdict for the plaintiff.
The Supreme Court held that there was ample evidence to support
the verdict and that the trial court, in following Arkansas proce-
dure in the diversity action, had acted consistently with the Fed-
eral Conformity Act.71 In the third case,72 which involved an action
against the government for benefits under a war risk insurance policy
that had been allowed to lapse, the trial court directed a verdict
for the government on the ground of the insufficiency of the evi-
dence, and was sustained in so doing by both the appeals court and
the Supreme Court. Justice Black, joined by Justices Douglas and
Murphy asserted in dissent, “Today’s decision marks a continua-
tion of the gradual process of judicial erosion which in one-hundred-
fifty years has slowly worn away a major portion of the essential
guarantee of the Seventh Amendment.” 73 That the Court should ex-
perience occasional difficulty in harmonizing the idea of preserving
the historic common law covering the relations of judge and jury
with the notion of a developing common law is not surprising.74
     Jury Trial Under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act.—
One aspect of the problem of delineating the respective provinces
of judge and jury divided the Justices for a lengthy period but now
appears quiescent—cases arising under the Federal Employers’ Li-
ability Act. The argument was frequently couched by the majority
in terms of protecting the function of the jury from usurpation by
judges intent on subverting and limiting remedial legislation en-

     72 Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 389 (1943), in which the Court wrote,

“the practice has been approved explicitly in the promulgation of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure,” citing Berry v. United States, 312 U.S. 450 (1941). In the latter
case the Court remarked that the new rule has given “district judges, under certain
circumstances, . . . the right (but not the mandatory duty) to enter a judgment con-
trary to the jury’s verdict without granting a new trial. But that rule has not taken
away from juries and given to judges any part of the exclusive power of juries to
weigh evidence and determine contested issues of facts—a jury being the constitu-
tional tribunal provided for trying facts in courts of law.” Id. at 452–53.
     73 319 U.S. 372, 397. The case, being a claim against the United States, need

not have been tried by a jury except for the allowance of Congress.
