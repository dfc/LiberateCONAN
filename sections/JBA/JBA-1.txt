                        REDUCTION OF VOTING AGE


                        TWENTY-SIXTH AMENDMENT

    SECTIONS 1 AND 2. The right of citizens of the United States,
who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States or by any State on ac-
count of age.
    The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by ap-
propriate legislation.
                        THE EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD VOTE
           In extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in 1970,1 Congress
       included a provision lowering the age qualification to vote in all elec-
       tions, federal, state, and local, to 18.2 In a divided decision, the Su-
       preme Court held that Congress was empowered to lower the age
       qualification in federal elections, but voided the application of the
       provision in all other elections as beyond congressional power.3 Con-
       fronted thus with the possibility that they might have to maintain
       two sets of registration books and go to the expense of running sepa-
       rate election systems for federal elections and for all other elec-
       tions, the states were receptive to the proposing of an Amendment
       by Congress to establish a minimum age qualification at 18 for all
       elections, and ratified it promptly.4
