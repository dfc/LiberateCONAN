      specified amounts, that limit to $1,000 the independent expenditures
      of any person relative to an identified candidate, and that forbid expen-
      ditures by candidates for federal office in excess of specified amounts
      violate the First Amendment speech guarantees; provisions of the law
      creating a commission to oversee enforcement of the Act are an in-
      valid infringement of constitutional separation of powers in that they
      devolve responsibilities upon a commission four of whose six members
      are appointed by Congress and all six of whom are confirmed by the
      House of Representatives as well as by the Senate, not in compliance
      with the appointments clause.

123. Act of February 7, 1972, Federal Election Campaign Act, (Pub. L. 92–
    225, Title III, § 316, as added Pub. L. 94–283, Title I, § 112(2), 90 Stat.
    490, 2 U.S.C. § 441b)
           Federal law prohibiting corporations from using their general trea-
      sury funds to make independent expenditures for an “electioneering
      communication” or for speech expressly advocating the election or de-
      feat of a candidate is invalidated. Disclaimers indicating who is respon-
      sible for political advertising and requiring the disclosure of campaign
      information to the FEC are upheld.

    216(b))
            Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 subjecting non-
      consenting states to suits for damages brought by employees in state
      courts violates the principle of sovereign immunity implicit in the con-
      stitutional scheme. Congress lacks power under Article I to subject non-
      consenting states to suits for damages in state courts.
