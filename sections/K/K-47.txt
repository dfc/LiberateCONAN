              United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–769, slip op. (2010)
              Justices concurring: Roberts, C.J., Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg,

168. Act of March 27, 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
    (Pub. L. 107–155, §§ 213, 318; 2 U.S.C. §§ 441a, 441k)
           Section 213 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA),
      which amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to
      require political parties to choose between coordinated and indepen-
      dent expenditures during the post-nomination, pre-election period, is
      unconstitutional because it burdens parties’ right to make unlimited
      independent expenditures. Section 318 of BCRA, which amended the
      FECA to prohibit persons “17 years old or younger” from contributing
      to candidates or political parties, is invalid as violating the First Amend-
      ment rights of minors.

169. Act of March 27, 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
    (Pub. L. 107–155, § 203; 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2))
           In McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), the Court held that § 203
      was not facially overbroad, and, in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Fed-
      eral Election Comm’n, 546 U.S. 410 (2006), it held that it had not pur-
      ported to resolve future as-applied challenges. Now it holds that § 203
      is unconstitutional as applied to issue ads that mention a candidate
      for federal office, when such ads are not the “functional equivalent” of
      express advocacy for or against the candidate.

              Justices dissenting: Souter, Stevens, Ginsberg, Breyer

170. Act of March 27, 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
    (Pub. L. 107–155, §§ 319(a) and (b); 2 U.S.C. § 441a–1(a) and (b))
          A subsection of BCRA providing that, if a “self-financing” candi-
      date for the House of Representatives spends more than a specified
      amount, then his opponent may accept more contributions than other-
      wise permitted, violates the First Amendment. A subsection with dis-
      closure requirements designed to implement the asymmetrical contri-
      bution limits also violates the First Amendment.
              Davis v. Federal Election Commission, 128 S. Ct. 2759 (2008).
              Justices concurring: Alito, Roberts, C.J., Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas
