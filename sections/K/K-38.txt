    U.S.C. § 982(a)(1))
           Statute requiring full criminal forfeiture of money transported out
      of the United States without amounts in excess of $10,000 being re-
      ported violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment

141. Act of October 30, 1986 (Pub. L. 99–591, title VI, § 6007(f)), 100 Stat.
    3341, 49 U.S.C. App. § 2456(f))
           The Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986, which trans-
      ferred operating control of two Washington, D.C., area airports from
      the Federal Government to a regional airports authority, violates sepa-
      ration of powers principles by conditioning that transfer on the estab-
      lishment of a Board of Review, composed of Members of Congress and
      having veto authority over actions of the airports authority’s board of
      directors.
              Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of Air-
                craft Noise, 501 U.S. 252 (1991)
              Justices concurring: Stevens, Blackmun, O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter
              Justices dissenting: White, Marshall, Rehnquist, C.J.

142. Act of November 17, 1986 (Pub. L. 99–662, title IV, § 1402(a), 26 U.S.C.
    §§ 4461, 4462)
           The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) violates the Export Clause
      of the Constitution, Art. I, § 9, cl. 5, to the extent that the tax applies
      to goods loaded for export at United States ports. The HMT, which
      requires shippers to pay a uniform charge of 0.125% of cargo value on
      commercial cargo shipped through the Nation’s ports, is an impermis-
      sible tax rather than a permissible user fee. The value of export cargo
      does not correspond reliably with federal harbor services used by ex-
      porters, and the tax does not, therefore, represent compensation for
      services rendered.
              United States v. United States Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360 (1998).

143. Act of April 28, 1988 (Pub. L. 100–297 § 6101, 102 Stat. 424, 47 U.S.C.
    § 223(b)(1))
           Amendment to Communications Act of 1934 imposing an outright
      ban on “indecent” but not obscene commercial telephone messages (“dial-
      a-porn”) violates the First Amendment, because it has not been shown
      to be narrowly tailored to further the governmental interest in protect-
      ing minors from hearing such messages.
