159. Act of September 13, 1994 (Pub. L. 103–322, § 40302, 108 Stat. 1941,
    42 U.S.C. § 13981)
           A provision of the Violence Against Women Act that creates a fed-
      eral civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence exceeds con-
      gressional power under the Commerce Clause and under section 5 of
      the Fourteenth Amendment. The commerce power does not authorize
      Congress to regulate “noneconomic violent criminal conduct based solely
      on that conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce.” The Four-
      teenth Amendment prohibits only state action, and affords no protec-
      tion against purely private conduct. Section 13981, however, is not aimed
      at the conduct of state officials, but is aimed at private conduct.
              United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000).
              Justices concurring: Rehnquist, C.J., O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas
              Justices dissenting: Souter, Breyer, Stevens, Ginsburg


160. Act of February 8, 1996, 110 Stat. 56, 133–34 (Pub. L. 104–104, title V,
    § 502, 47 U.S.C. §§ 223(a), 223(d))
           Two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996—one
      that prohibits knowing transmission on the Internet of obscene or in-
      decent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age, and the other
      that prohibits the knowing sending or displaying of patently offensive
      messages in a manner that is available to anyone under 18 years of
      age—violate the First Amendment.
              Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997).
              Justices concurring: Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer
              Justices concurring in part and dissenting in part: O’Connor, Rehnquist, C.J.


161. Act of February 8, 1996 (Pub. L. 104–104, § 505, 110 Stat. 136, 47 U.S.C.
    § 561)
           Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which re-
      quired cable TV operators that offer channels primarily devoted to sexu-
      ally oriented programming to prevent signal bleed either by fully scram-
      bling those channels or by limiting their transmission to designated
      hours when children are less likely to be watching, violates the First
      Amendment. The provision is content-based, and therefore can only
      be upheld if narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental
      interest. The measure is not narrowly tailored, as the government did
      not establish that the less restrictive alternative found in section 504
      of the Act—that of scrambling a channel at a subscriber’s request—
      would be ineffective.
              United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803 (2000).
              Justices concurring: Kennedy, Stevens, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg
              Justices dissenting: Scalia, Breyer, O’Connor, Scalia, Rehnquist, C.J.
