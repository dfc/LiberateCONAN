150. Act of November 29, 1990 (Pub. L. 101–647, § 1702, 104 Stat. 4844, 18
    U.S.C. § 922(q))
           The Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which makes it a crimi-
      nal offense to knowingly possess a firearm within a school zone, ex-
      ceeds congressional power under the Commerce Clause. It is “a crimi-
      nal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any
      sort of economic enterprise.” Possession of a gun at or near a school
      “is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition else-
      where, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.”
              United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995).
              Justices concurring: Rehnquist, C.J., O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas
              Justices dissenting: Stevens, Souter, Breyer, Ginsburg


151. Act of December 19, 1991 (Pub. L. 102–242 § 476, 105 Stat. 2387, 15
    U.S.C. § 78aa–1)
           Section 27A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added
      in 1991, requiring reinstatement of any section 10(b) actions that were
      dismissed as time barred subsequent to a 1991 Supreme Court deci-
      sion, violates the Constitution’s separation of powers to the extent that
      it requires federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil ac-
      tions. The provision violates a fundamental principle of Article III that
      the federal judicial power comprehends the power to render disposi-
      tive judgments.
              Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995).
              Justices concurring: Scalia, O’Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Rehnquist, C.J.
              Justice concurring specially: Breyer
              Justices dissenting: Stevens, Ginsburg


152. Act of October 5, 1992 (Pub. L. 102–385, §§ 10(b) and 10(c), 106 Stat.
    1487, 1503; 47 U.S.C. § 532(j) and § 531 note, respectively)
           Section 10(b) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Com-
      petition Act of 1992, which requires cable operators to segregate and
      block indecent programming on leased access channels if they do not
      prohibit it, violates the First Amendment. Section 10(c) of the Act, which
      permits a cable operator to prevent transmission of “sexually explicit”
      programming on public access channels, also violates the First Amend-
      ment.
              Denver Area Educ. Tel. Consortium v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727 (1996).
              Justices concurring: Breyer, Stevens, O’Connor (§ 10(b) only), Kennedy, Souter,
                Ginsburg
              Justices dissenting: Thomas, Scalia, O’Connor (§ 10(c) only), Rehnquist, C.J.
