156. Act of February 5, 1993 (Pub. L. 103–3, 107 Stat. 9, 29 U.S.C. § 2612)
           Congress may not require a state employer to grant a state em-
      ployee unpaid self-care leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
      Congress cannot abrogate state immunity under section 5 of the Four-
      teenth Amendment to enforce self-care leave requirements because those
      requirements are intended primarily to ameliorate discrimination based
      on personal illness and are not a congruent and proportional remedy
      for gender discrimination.
              Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–1016, slip op.
                (2012).
              Justices concurring: Kennedy, Roberts, C.J., Thomas, Alito
              Justices concurring specially: Scalia
              Justices dissenting: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan

157. Act of November 16, 1993 (Pub. L. 103–141, 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C.
    §§ 2000bb to 2000bb–4)
           The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which directed use of the
      compelling interest test to determine the validity of laws of general
      applicability that substantially burden the free exercise of religion, ex-
      ceeds congressional power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-
      ment. Congress’s power under Section 5 to “enforce” the Fourteenth
      Amendment by “appropriate legislation” does not extend to defining
      the substance of the Amendment’s restrictions. This RFRA appears to
      do. RFRA “is so far out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preven-
      tive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed
      to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.”
              City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997).
              Justices concurring: Kennedy, Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, Rehnquist, C.J.
              Justices dissenting: O’Connor, Breyer, Souter

158. Act of November 30, 1993 (Pub. L. 103–159, 107 Stat. 1536)
           Interim provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act
      that require state and local law enforcement officers to conduct back-
      ground checks on prospective handgun purchasers are inconsistent with
      the Constitution’s allocation of power between Federal and state gov-
      ernments. In New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), the Court
      held that Congress may not compel states to enact or enforce a fed-
      eral regulatory program, and “Congress cannot circumvent that prohi-
      bition by conscripting the State’s officers directly.”
              Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).
              Justices concurring: Scalia, O’Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Rehnquist, C.J.
              Justices dissenting: Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer
