      on the earnings of a deceased husband and father covered by the Act
      to his widow and to the couple’s children in her care but that grants

      the right to equal protection secured by the Fifth Amendment’s Due
      Process Clause, because it unjustifiably discriminates against female
      wage earners required to pay social security taxes by affording them
      less protection for their survivors than is provided for male wage earn-
      ers.
