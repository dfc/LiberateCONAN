      Indian tribe to sue a State in federal court to compel performance of a
      duty to negotiate in good faith toward the formation of a compact vio-
      lates the Eleventh Amendment. In exercise of its powers under Article
      I, Congress may not abrogate States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity
      from suit in federal court. Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1

145. Act of October 28, 1989 (Pub. L. 101–131, 103 Stat. 777, 18 U.S.C. § 700)
           The Flag Protection Act of 1989, criminalizing burning and cer-
      tain other forms of destruction of the United States flag, violates the

      tive Branch employees below grade GS–16. The ban is limited to ex-
      pressive activity and does not include other outside income, and the
      “speculative benefits” of the ban do not justify its “crudely crafted bur-
      den” on expression.

           Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), ex-
      ceeds congressional power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, and
