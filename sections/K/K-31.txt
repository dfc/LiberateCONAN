              Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76 (1979).

115. Act of June 19, 1968 (Pub. L. 90–351, § 701(a), 82 Stat. 210, 18 U.S.C.
    § 3501)
           A section of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
      1968 purporting to reinstate the voluntariness principle that had gov-
      erned the constitutionality of custodial interrogations prior to the Court’s
      decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), is an invalid at-
      tempt by Congress to redefine a constitutional protection defined by
      the Court. The warnings to suspects required by Miranda are
      Constitution-based rules. Although the Miranda Court invited a legis-
      lative rule that would be “at least as effective” in protecting a sus-
      pect’s right to remain silent, section 3501 is not an adequate substi-
      tute.

116. Act of June 19, 1968 (Pub. L. No. 90–351, § 802, 82 Stat. 213, 18 U.S.C.
    § 2511(1)(c), as amended by the Act of October 21, 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99–
    508, § 101(c)(1)(A)), 100 Stat. 1851))
           A federal prohibition on disclosure of the contents of an illegally
      intercepted electronic communication violates the First Amendment as
      applied to a talk show host and a community activist who had played
      no part in the illegal interception, and who had lawfully obtained tapes
      of the illegally intercepted cellular phone conversation. The subject mat-
      ter of the disclosed conversation, involving a threat of violence in a
      labor dispute, was “a matter of public concern.” Although the disclo-
      sure prohibition well serves the government’s “important” interest in
      protecting private communication, in this case “privacy concerns give
      way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of pub-
      lic importance.”

117. Act of June 22, 1970 (ch. III, 84 Stat. 318)
           Provision of Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 that set a mini-
      mum voting age qualification of 18 in state and local elections held to
      be unconstitutional because beyond the powers of Congress to legis-
      late.
