135. Act of April 20, 1983, 97 Stat. 69 (Pub. L. No. 98–21 § 101(b)(1) (amend-
    ing 26 U.S.C. § 3121(b)(5))
           The 1983 extension of the Social Security tax to then-sitting judges
      violates the Compensation Clause of Article III, § 1. The Clause “does
      not prevent Congress from imposing a non-discriminatory tax laid gen-
      erally upon judges and other citizens . . . , but it does prohibit taxa-
      tion that singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment.” The
      1983 Social Security law gave 96% of federal employees “total free-
      dom” of choice about whether to participate in the system, and struc-
      tured the system in such a way that “virtually all” of the remaining
      4% of employees—except the judges—could opt to retain existing cov-
      erage. By requiring then-sitting judges to join the Social Security Sys-
      tem and pay Social Security taxes, the 1983 law discriminated against
      judges in violation of the Compensation Clause.

136. Act of July 10, 1984 (Pub. L. 98–353, Title I, § 104(a), 98 Stat. 340; 28
    U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(C)
           Because bankruptcy courts are Article I entities, Congress estab-
      lished a division between “core proceedings,” which could be heard and
      determined by bankruptcy courts, subject to lenient review, and other
      proceedings, which, though initially heard and decided by bankruptcy
      courts, could be reviewed de novo in the district court at the behest of
      any party, unless the parties had consented to bankruptcy-court juris-
      diction in the same manner as core proceedings. Among these “core
      proceedings” were counterclaims by the estate against persons filing
      claims against the estate. The Court held that a counterclaim of tor-
      tious interference with a gift, although made during a bankruptcy pro-
      ceeding, was a state common law claim that did not fall under any of
      the public rights exceptions allowing for exercise of Article III jurisdic-
      tion.

              Justices dissenting: Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan
