67. Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1289, ch. 869)
           The Frazier-Lemke Act, adding subsection (s) to § 75 of the Bank-
      ruptcy Act, designed to preserve to mortgagors the ownership and en-
      joyment of their farm property and providing specifically, in para-
      graph 7, that a bankrupt left in possession has the option at any time
      within 5 years of buying at the appraised value—subject meanwhile
      to no monetary obligation other than payment of reasonable rental,
      held a violation of property rights, under the Fifth Amendment.
             Louisville Bank v. Radford, 295 U.S. 555 (1935).

68. Act of August 24, 1935 (49 Stat. 750).
           Amendments of Agricultural Adjustment Act held not within the
      taxing power, the amendments not having cured the defects of the origi-
      nal act held unconstitutional in United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1
      (1936).
             Rickert Rice Mills v. Fontenot, 297 U.S. 110 (1936).

69. Act of August 29, 1935, ch. 814 § 5(e) (49 Stat. 982, 27 U.S.C. § 205(e))
           The prohibition in section 5(e)(2) of the Federal Alcohol Adminis-
      tration Act of 1935 on the display of alcohol content on beer labels is
      inconsistent with the protections afforded to commercial speech by the
      First Amendment. The government’s interest in curbing strength wars
      among brewers is substantial, but, given the “overall irrationality” of
      the regulatory scheme, the labeling prohibition does not directly and
      materially advance that interest.

             Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936).

71. Act of February 15, 1938, ch. 29 (52 Stat. 30)
           District of Columbia Code § 22–1115, prohibiting the display of any
      sign within 500 feet of a foreign embassy if the sign tends to bring
      the foreign government into “public odium” or “public disrepute,” vio-
      lates the First Amendment.
