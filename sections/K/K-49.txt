174. Act of April 30, 2003 (Pub. L. 108–21, § 401(e), 117 Stat. 671; 18 U.S.C.
    § 3742(g)(2))
           In evaluating whether Congress has authorized a District Court
      to consider post-conviction behavior as part of resentencing (after a
      sentence has been appealed, vacated, and remanded), the Court holds
      that a statutory limitation on the use of such information during re-
      sentencing to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines is no longer valid
      after United States v. Booker.

175. Act of December 30, 2005 (Pub. L. 109–148, § 1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742;
    28 U.S.C. § 2241(e)(1))
           A provision of the Detainee Treatment Act eliminating federal ha-
      beas jurisdiction over alien detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
      is invalidated as a violation of the Suspension Clause [Art. I, § 9, clause
      2]. As the detainees disputed their enemy status, their ability to dis-
      pute their status had been limited, and they were held in a location
      under the de facto jurisdiction of the United States, the Suspension
      Clause was in full effect regarding their detention.

              Justices concurring: Kennedy, Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer
              Justices dissenting: Roberts, C.J., Scalia, Thomas, Alito

176. Act of December 20, 2006 (Pub. L. 109–437, § 3, 120 Stat. 3266, 18 U.S.C.
    § 704)
           Stolen Valor Act, which penalizes any false claim of having been
      awarded a military decoration or medal, is invalidated on First Amend-
      ment grounds by four Justices for failure to be shown to be actually
      necessary to meet compelling governmental interests (strict scrutiny),
      and by two additional Justices for failure to achieve legitimate objec-
      tives through less restrictive ways (intermediate scrutiny).
              United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. ___, No. 11–210, slip op. (2012).

              Justices concurring specially: Breyer, Kagan
              Justice dissenting: Alito, Scalia, Thomas
