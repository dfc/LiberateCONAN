165. Act of September 30, 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104–208, § 121, 110 Stat. 3009–
    26, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252, 2256)
           Two sections of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 that
      extend the federal prohibition against child pornography to sexually
      explicit images that appear to depict minors but that were produced
      without using any real child violate the First Amendment. These pro-
      visions cover any visual image that “appears to be” of a minor engag-
      ing in sexually explicit conduct, and any image promoted or presented
      in a way that “conveys the impression” that it depicts a minor engag-
      ing in sexually explicit conduct. The rationale for excepting child por-
      nography from First Amendment coverage is to protect children who
      are abused and exploited in the production process, yet the Act’s pro-
      hibitions extend to “virtual” pornography that does not involve a child
      in the production process.

166. Act of November 21, 1997 (Pub. L. 105–115, § 127, 111 Stat. 2328, 21
    U.S.C. § 353a)
           Section 127 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization
      Act of 1997, which adds section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and
      Cosmetic Act to exempt “compounded drugs” from the regular FDA ap-
      proval process if providers comply with several restrictions, including
      that they refrain from advertising or promoting the compounded drugs,
      violates the First Amendment. The advertising restriction does not meet
      the Central Hudson test for acceptable governmental regulation of com-
      mercial speech. The government failed to demonstrate that the adver-
      tising restriction is “not more extensive than is necessary” to serve its
      interest in preventing the drug compounding exemption from becom-
      ing a loophole by which large-scale drug manufacturing can avoid the
      FDA drug approval process. There are several non-speech means by
      which the government might achieve its objective.
