      state’s failure to make reasonable accommodations for qualified indi-
      viduals with disabilities. Rational basis review applies, and conse-
      quently states “are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make
      special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions to-
      wards such individuals are rational.” The legislative record of the ADA
      fails to show that Congress identified a pattern of irrational state em-
      ployment discrimination against the disabled. Moreover, even if a pat-
      tern of discrimination by states had been found, the ADA’s remedies
      would run afoul of the “congruence and proportionality” limitation on
      Congress’s exercise of enforcement power.

148. Act of July 26, 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101–336, Title I, 104 Stat. 327, 42
    U.S.C. §§ 12111, 12203)
           Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) may
      not be applied against a religious organization for the discharge of a
      “called” teacher at a parochial school. The Establishment and Free Ex-
      ercise Clauses bar ADA actions by or on behalf of ministers against
      their churches, and an ordained teacher may fall within the “ministe-
      rial exception” even though she teaches many secular subjects and her
      discharge may not have been doctrinally based.

149. Act of November 28, 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101–624, Title XIX, Subtitle B,
    104 Stat. 3854, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6101 et seq.)
           The Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information
      Act violates the First Amendment by imposing mandatory assess-
      ments on mushroom handlers for the purpose of funding generic adver-
      tising to promote mushroom sales. The mushroom program differs “in
      a most fundamental respect” from the compelled assessment on fruit
      growers upheld in Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc. (1997).
      There the mandated assessments were “ancillary to a more comprehen-
      sive program restricting marketing autonomy,” while here there is “no
      broader regulatory system in place.” The mushroom program contains
      no marketing orders that regulate how mushrooms may be produced
      and sold, no exemption from the antitrust laws, and nothing else that
      forces mushroom producers to associate as a group to make coopera-
      tive decisions. But for the assessment for advertising, the mushroom
      growing business is unregulated.
