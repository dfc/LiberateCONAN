153. Act of October 24, 1992, Title XIX, 106 Stat. 3037 (Pub. L. 102–486, 26
    U.S.C. §§ 9701–9722)
           The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 is unconsti-
      tutional as applied to the petitioner Eastern Enterprises. Pursuant to
      the Act, the Social Security Commissioner imposed liability on East-
      ern for funding health care benefits of retirees from the coal industry
      who had worked for Eastern prior to 1966. Eastern had transferred
      its coal-related business to a subsidiary in 1965. Four Justices viewed
      the imposition of liability on Eastern as a violation of the Takings Clause,
      and one Justice viewed it as a violation of substantive due process.

154. Act of October 27, 1992 (Pub. L. 102–542, 15 U.S.C. § 1122)
           The Trademark Remedy Clarification Act, which provided that states
      shall not be immune from suit under the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham
      Act) “under the eleventh amendment . . . or under any other doctrine
      of sovereign immunity,” did not validly abrogate state sovereign immu-
      nity. Congress lacks power to do so in exercise of Article I powers, and
      the TRCA cannot be justified as an exercise of power under section 5
      of the Fourteenth Amendment. The right to be free from a business
      competitor’s false advertising is not a “property right” protected by the
      Due Process Clause.

155. Act of October 28, 1992 (Pub. L. 102–560, 106 Stat. 4230, 35 U.S.C.
    § 296)
           The Patent and Plant Variety Remedy Clarification Act, which
      amended the patent laws to expressly abrogate states’ sovereign immu-
      nity from patent infringement suits is invalid. Congress lacks power
      to abrogate state immunity in exercise of Article I powers, and the Pat-
      ent Remedy Clarification Act cannot be justified as an exercise of power
      under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 power is re-
      medial, yet the legislative record reveals no identified pattern of pat-
      ent infringement by states and the Act’s provisions are “out of propor-
      tion to a supposed remedial or preventive object.”

                U.S. 627 (1999).
              Justices concurring: Rehnquist, C.J., O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas
