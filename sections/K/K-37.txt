137. Act of October 30, 1984, (Pub. L. 98–608, § 1(4), 98 Stat. 3173, 25 U.S.C.
    § 2206)
           Section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act, as amended in
      1984, effects an unconstitutional taking of property without compensa-
      tion by restricting a property owner’s right to pass on property to his
      heirs. The amended section, like an earlier version held unconstitu-
      tional in Hodel v. Irving (1987), provides that certain small interests
      in Indian land will escheat to the tribe upon death of the owner. None
      of the changes made in 1984 cures the constitutional defect.

138. Act of January 15, 1985, (Pub. L. 99–240, § 5(d)(2)(C), 99 Stat. 1842, 42
    U.S.C. § 2021e(d)(2)(C))
           “Take-title” incentives contained in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste
      Policy Amendments Act of 1985, designed to encourage states to coop-
      erate in the federal regulatory scheme, offend principles of federalism
      embodied in the Tenth Amendment. These incentives, which require
      that non-participating states take title to waste or become liable for
      generators’ damages, cross the line distinguishing encouragement from
      coercion. Congress may not simply commandeer the legislative and regu-
      latory processes of the states, nor may it force a transfer from genera-
      tors to state governments. A required choice between two unconstitu-
      tionally coercive regulatory techniques is also impermissible.

              Justices dissenting: White, Blackmun, Stevens

139. Act of December 12, 1985 (Pub. L. 99–177, § 251), 99 Stat. 1063, 2 U.S.C.
    § 901)
           That portion of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Con-
      trol Act that authorizes the Comptroller General to determine the amount
      of spending reductions that must be accomplished each year to reach
      congressional targets and that authorizes him to report a figure to the
      President that the President must implement violates the constitu-
      tional separation of powers because the Comptroller General is sub-
      ject to congressional control (removal) and cannot be given a role in
      the execution of the laws.
