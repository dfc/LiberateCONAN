court which handed down the original decree.27 Records and pro-
ceedings of courts wanting jurisdiction are not entitled to credit.28
     Judgments in Personam.—When the subject matter of a suit
is merely the defendant’s liability, it is necessary that it should ap-
pear from the record that the defendant has been brought within
the jurisdiction of the court by personal service of process, or by
his voluntary appearance, or that he had in some manner autho-
rized the proceeding.29 Thus, when a state court endeavored to ac-
quire jurisdiction of a nonresident defendant by an attachment of
his property within the state and constructive notice to him, its judg-
ment was defective for want of jurisdiction and hence could not af-
ford the basis of an action against the defendant in the court of
another state, although it bound him so far as the property at-
tached by virtue of the inherent right of a state to assist its own
citizens in obtaining satisfaction of their just claims.30
    The fact that a nonresident defendant was only temporarily in
the state when he was served in the original action does not vitiate
the judgment thus obtained and later relied upon as the basis of
an action in his home state.31 Also a judgment rendered in the state
of his domicile against a defendant who, pursuant to the statute
thereof providing for the service of process on absent defendants,
was personally served in another state is entitled to full faith and
credit.32 When the matter of fact or law on which jurisdiction de-

Pennsylvania, 368 U.S. 71 (1961). Full faith and credit extends to the issue of the
original court’s jurisdiction, when the second court’s inquiry discloses that the ques-
tion of jurisdiction had been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court
which rendered the original judgment. Durfee v. Duke, 375 U.S. 106 (1963); Under-
writers Assur. Co. v. North Carolina Life Ins. Ass’n, 455 U.S. 691 (1982).

v. Old Dominion Copper Co., 225 U.S. 111 (1912); Spokane Inland R.R. v. Whitley,
237 U.S. 487 (1915). However, a denial of credit, founded upon a mere suggestion of
want of jurisdiction and unsupported by evidence, violates the clause. Rogers v. Ala-
bama, 192 U.S. 226, 231 (1904); Wells Fargo & Co. v. Ford, 238 U.S. 503 (1915).

Ketchum, 52 U.S. (1 How.) 165 (1851), the question presented was whether a judg-
ment rendered by a New York court, under a statute which provided that, when
joint debtors were sued and one of them was brought into court on a process, a judg-
ment in favor of the plaintiff would entitle him to execute against all, must be ac-
corded full faith and credit in Louisiana when offered as a basis of an action in debt
