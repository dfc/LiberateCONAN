pends was not litigated in the original suit, it is a matter to be
adjudicated in the suit founded upon the judgment.33
    Because the principle of res judicata applies only to proceed-
ings between the same parties and privies, the plea by defendant
in an action based on a judgment that he was not party or privy to
the original action raises the question of jurisdiction; although a
judgment against a corporation in one state may validly bind a stock-
holder in another state to the extent of the par value of his hold-
ings,34 an administrator acting under a grant of administration in
one state stands in no sort of relation of privity to an administra-
tor of the same estate in another state.35 But where a judgment of
dismissal was entered in a federal court in an action against one of
two joint tortfeasors, in a state in which such a judgment would
constitute an estoppel in another action in the same state against
the other tortfeasor, such judgment is not entitled to full faith and
credit in an action brought against the tortfeasor in another state.36
    Service on Foreign Corporations.—In 1856, the Court de-
cided Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French,37 a pioneer case in its general
class. It held that, where a corporation chartered by the State of
Indiana was allowed by a law of Ohio to transact business in the
latter state upon the condition that service of process upon the agent
of the corporation should be considered as service upon the corpora-
tion itself, a judgment obtained against the corporation by means
of such process ought to receive in Indiana the same faith and credit
as it was entitled to in Ohio.38 Later cases establish under both
the Fourteenth Amendment and Article IV, § 1, that the cause of
action must have arisen within the state obtaining service in this
way,39 that service on an officer of a corporation, not its resident
agent and not present in the state in an official capacity, will not

against a resident of that state who had not been served by process in the New
York action. The Court ruled that the original implementing statute, 1 Stat. 122
(1790), did not reach this type of case, and hence the New York judgment was not
enforceable in Louisiana against defendant. Had the Louisiana defendant thereafter
ventured to New York, however, he could, as the Constitution then stood, have been
subjected to the judgment to the same extent as the New York defendant who had
been personally served. Subsequently, the disparity between operation of personal
judgment in the home state has been eliminated, because of the adoption of the Four-
teenth Amendment. In divorce cases, however, it still persists in some measure. See
