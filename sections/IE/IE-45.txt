cut 186 extended the same rule to wild game, and Hudson Water Co.
v. McCarter 187 applied it to the running water of a state. In Toomer
v. Witsell,188 however, the Court refused to apply this rule to free-
swimming fish caught in the three-mile belt off the coast of South
Carolina. It held instead that “commercial shrimping in the mar-
ginal sea, like other common callings, is within the purview of the
privileges and immunities clause” and that a severely discrimina-
tory license fee exacted from nonresidents was unconstitutional.189
    As the state “public patrimony” theory of resource ownership
receded 190 into one of power to regulate and preserve, the essential
inquiry in resources cases became whether a state distinguished be-
tween residents and nonresidents 191 in regulating a “fundamental”
activity, that is, an activity the “interference with which would frus-
trate the purposes of the formation of the Union.” 192 Thus, recre-
ational hunting was found not to be a fundamental activity, be-
cause regulating it did not frustrate the ability of nonresidents to
work or travel within the state, nor was nondiscriminatory access
to sport hunting within the state otherwise basic to maintaining
the primacy of the Nation.193 Accessing public records through a state
freedom of information act also has been held not to be a “funda-
mental” activity, and a state may limit such access to its own citi-
zens.194

    187  209 U.S. 349 (1908).
     188 334 U.S. 385 (1948).
     189 334 U.S. at 403. In Mullaney v. Anderson, 342 U.S. 415 (1952), an Alaska

statute providing for the licensing of commercial fishermen in territorial waters and
levying a license fee of $50.00 on nonresident and only $5.00 on resident fishermen
was held void under Art. IV, § 2 on the authority of Toomer v. Witsell.
     190 The legal fiction of state ownership was eventually discredited as erecting

impermissible barriers to interstate commerce. See Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc.,
431 U.S. 265, 284 (1977) (dictum). Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519 (1896), was
overruled in Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 (1979); Hudson Water Co. v. Mc-
Carter, 209 U.S. 349 (1908), was overruled in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas,
458 U.S. 941 (1982).
     191 Although the clause specifically refers to “citizens,” the Court treats the terms

“citizens” and “residents” as “essentially interchangeable.” Austin v. New Hamp-
shire, 420 U.S. 656, 662 n.8 (1975); Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.S. 518, 524 n.8 (1978).
     192 Justice Washington’s opinion on Circuit in Coryell afforded the Court the stan-

dard. While recognizing that Justice Washington relied on notions of natural rights,
the Court thought he used the term “fundamental” in the modern sense as well.
     193 Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U.S. 371, 387 (1978) (uphold-

ing substantially higher hunting license fees for nonresidents).
     194 McBurney v. Young, 569 U.S. ___, No. 12–17, slip op. (2013). The Court fur-

ther found that any incidental burden on a nonresident’s ability to earn a living,
own property, or exercise another “fundamemtal” activity could largely be amelio-
rated by using other available authorities. The Court also emphasized that the pri-
mary purpose of the state freedom of information act was to provide state citizens
with a means to obtain an accounting of their public officials.
