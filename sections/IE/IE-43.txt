States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are concerned, the ques-
tion was put at rest by the Fourteenth Amendment.
     Corporations.—At a comparatively early date, the claim was
made that a corporation chartered by a state and consisting of its
citizens was entitled to the benefits of the comity clause in the trans-
action of business in other states. It was argued that the Court was
bound to look beyond the act of incorporation and see who were
the incorporators. If it found these to consist solely of citizens of
the incorporating state, it was bound to permit them through the
agency of the corporation to exercise in other states such privileges
and immunities as the citizens thereof enjoyed. In Bank of Au-
gusta v. Earle,174 this view was rejected. The Court held that the
comity clause was never intended “to give to the citizens of each
State the privileges of citizens in the several States, and at the same
time to exempt them [under a corporate veil] from the liabilities
which the exercise of such privileges would bring upon individuals
who were citizens of the State. This would be to give the citizens of
other States far higher and greater privileges than are enjoyed by
the citizens of the State itself.” 175 A similar result was reached in
Paul v. Virginia.176 The Court there held that a corporation, in this
instance, an insurance company, was “the mere creation of local law”
and could “have no legal existence beyond the limits of the sover-
eignty” 177 which created it; even recognition of its existence by other
states rested exclusively in their discretion.178 By reason of its simi-
larity to the corporate form of organization, a Massachusetts trust
has been denied the protection of this clause.179

All Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the Several
  States
    The scope of “privileges and immunities” comprehended by the
comity clause is bound by the provision’s purpose. The classical ju-
dicial exposition of the meaning of the phrase is that of Justice Wash-
ington in Corfield v. Coryell,180 which was decided by him on cir-
cuit in 1823. The question at issue was the validity of a New Jersey
statute that prohibited “any person who is not, at the time, an ac-
tual inhabitant and resident in this State” from raking or gather-

    175 38 U.S. at 586.
    176 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168 (1869).
    177 75 U.S. at 181.
    178 Later cases held that this discretion is qualified by other provisions of the

Constitution notably the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. Crutcher
