was a much wordier and a somewhat unclear 149 clause of the Ar-
ticles of Confederation. “The better to secure and perpetuate mu-
tual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different
States in this Union, the free inhabitants of each of these States,
paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be en-
titled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the sev-
eral States; and the people of each State shall have free ingress
and regress to and from any other State, and shall enjoy therein
all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same du-
ties, impositions and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respec-
tively . . . .” 150 In the Convention, the present clause was pre-
sented, reported by the Committee on Detail, and adopted all in
the language ultimately approved.151 Little commentary was ad-
dressed to it,152 and we may assume with Justice Miller that “[t]here
can be but little question that the purpose of both these provisions
is the same, and that the privileges and immunities intended are
the same in each. In the Articles of Confederation we have some of
these specifically mentioned, and enough perhaps to give some gen-
eral idea of the class of civil rights meant by the phrase.” 153 At least
four theories have been proffered regarding the purpose of this clause.
First, the clause is a guaranty of equal treatment by Congress to
the citizens of the different states; in other words, it is a species of
equal protection clause binding on the National Government. Though
it received some recognition in the Dred Scott case,154 particularly
the opinion of Justice Catron,155 this theory is now obsolete.156 Sec-
ond, the clause is a guaranty to the citizens of each state of the
natural and fundamental rights inherent in the citizenship of per-

     152 “It may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that ‘the citizens of each State

shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.’
And if it be a just principle that every government ought to possess the means of
executing its own provisions by its own authority, it will follow, that in order to the
inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the
citizens of the Union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside in all
cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens.
To secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and sub-
terfuge, it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal
which, having no local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between the differ-
ent States and their citizens, and which, owing its official existence to the Union,
will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which its is
founded.” THE FEDERALIST, No. 80 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 537–538 (Hamilton).
