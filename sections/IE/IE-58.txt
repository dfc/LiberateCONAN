state law.279 When the enabling act contains no exclusion of juris-
diction as to crimes committed on Indian reservations by persons
other than Indians, state courts are vested with jurisdiction.280 But
the constitutional authority of Congress to regulate commerce with
Indian tribes is not inconsistent with the equality of new states,281
and conditions inserted in the New Mexico Enabling Act forbidding
the introduction of liquor into Indian territory were therefore valid.282
Similarly, Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on lands
ceded to the Federal Government were not extinguished by state-
hood. These “usufructuary” rights were subject to reasonable state
regulation, and hence were not irreconcilable with state sover-
eignty over natural resources.283
    Admission of a state on an equal footing with the original states
involves the adoption as citizens of the United States of those whom
Congress makes members of the political community and who are
recognized as such in the formation of the new state.284

Judicial Proceedings Pending on Admission of New States
    Whenever a territory is admitted into the Union, the cases pend-
ing in the territorial court that are of exclusive federal cognizance
are transferred to the federal court having jurisdiction over the area;
cases not cognizable in the federal courts are transferred to the tri-
bunals of the new state, and those over which federal and state courts
have concurrent jurisdiction may be transferred either to the state
or federal courts by the party possessing the option under existing
law.285 Where Congress neglected to make provision for disposition
of certain pending cases in an enabling act for the admission of a
state to the Union, a subsequent act supplying the omission was
held valid.286 After a case, begun in a United States court of a ter-
ritory, is transferred to a state court under the operation of the en-
