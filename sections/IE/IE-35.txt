guage” to the effect that those laws were exclusive of any remedy
under the laws of any other state would supplementary awards be
precluded.138 Although the overwhelming number of state court de-
cisions since follow McCartin, and Magnolia has been little no-
ticed, all the Justices expressed dissatisfaction with the former case
as a rule of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, although a majority
of the Court followed it and permitted a supplementary award.139
    Full Faith and Credit and Statutes of Limitation.—The Full
Faith and Credit Clause is not violated by a state statute provid-
ing that all suits upon foreign judgments shall be brought within
five years after such judgment shall have been obtained, where the
statute has been construed by the state courts as barring suits on
foreign judgments, only if the plaintiff could not revive his judg-
ment in the state where it was originally obtained.140

              FULL FAITH AND CREDIT: MISCELLANY

Full Faith and Credit in Federal Courts
    The rule of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1738–1739 pertains not merely to rec-
ognition by state courts of the records and judicial proceedings of
courts of sister states but to recognition by “every court within the
United States,” including recognition of the records and proceed-
ings of the courts of any territory or any country subject to the ju-
risdiction of the United States. The federal courts are bound to give
to the judgments of the state courts the same faith and credit that
the courts of one state are bound to give to the judgments of the
courts of her sister states.141 Where suits to enforce the laws of one
state are entertained in courts of another on principles of comity,
federal district courts sitting in that state may entertain them and

    139 Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261 (1980). For the disap-
proval of McCartin, see id. at 269–72 (plurality opinion of four), 289 (concurring opin-
ion of three), 291 (dissenting opinion of two). But the four Justice plurality would
have instead overruled Magnolia, id. at 277–86, and adopted the rule of interest
balancing used in deciding which state may apply its laws in the first place. The
dissenting two Justices would have overruled McCartin and followed Magnolia. Id.
at 290. The other Justices considered Magnolia the sounder rule but decided to fol-
low McCurtin because it could be limited to workmen’s compensation cases, thus
requiring no evaluation of changes throughout the reach of the Full Faith and Credit
Clause. Id. at 286.
