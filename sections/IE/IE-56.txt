ceded it to the United States. To maintain any other doctrine, is to
deny that Alabama has been admitted into the union on an equal
footing with the original states, the constitution, laws, and com-
pact, to the contrary notwithstanding. . . . [T]o Alabama belong the
navigable waters and soils under them, in controversy in this case,
subject to the rights surrendered by the Constitution to the United
States; and no compact that might be made between her and the
United States could diminish or enlarge these rights.” 269
    Finally, in 1911, the Court invalidated a restriction on the change
of location of the state capital, which Congress had imposed as a
condition for the admission of Oklahoma, on the ground that Con-
gress may not embrace in an enabling act conditions relating wholly
to matters under state control.270 In an opinion, from which Jus-
tices Holmes and McKenna dissented, Justice Lurton argued: “The
power is to admit ‘new States into this Union,’ ‘This Union’ was
and is a union of States, equal in power, dignity and authority, each
competent to exert that residuum of sovereignty not delegated to
the United States by the Constitution itself. To maintain otherwise
would be to say that the Union, through the power of Congress to
admit new States, might come to be a union of States unequal in
power, as including States whose powers were restricted only by
the Constitution, with others whose powers had been further re-
stricted by an act of Congress accepted as a condition of admis-
sion.” 271
    The equal footing doctrine is a limitation only upon the terms
by which Congress admits a state.272 That is, states must be admit-
ted on an equal footing in the sense that Congress may not exact
conditions solely as a tribute for admission, but it may, in the en-
abling or admitting acts or subsequently impose requirements that
would be or are valid and effectual if the subject of congressional

supplied). See also id. at 222–23. A unanimous Court explained the rule on state
ownership of navigable waters in PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana, 565 U.S. ___, No.
10–218, slip op. (2012). Under the equal footing doctrine, a State, upon entering the
Union, gains title to the beds of waters then navigable or tidally influenced, subject
only to federal powers under the Constitution (e.g., the Commerce Clause). By con-
trast, the United States retains any title vested in it to lands beneath waters not
then navigable or tidally influenced. For the distinct purpose of the equal footing
doctrine, “navigable waters” are those waters used, or susceptible to use, for trade
and travel by customary means at the time of statehood. Furthermore, the “naviga-
bility” of rivers is determined on a segment-by-segment basis, and lands under por-
tions of a stream that were impassable at statehood were not conveyed by force of
the doctrine.
