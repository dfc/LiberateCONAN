How Implemented
    The Privileges and Immunities Clause is self-executory, that is
to say, its enforcement is dependent upon the judicial process. It
does not authorize penal legislation by Congress. Federal statutes
prohibiting conspiracies to deprive any person of rights or privi-
leges secured by state laws,169 or punishing infractions by individu-
als of the right of citizens to reside peacefully in the several states
and to have free ingress into and egress from such states,170 have
been held void.

Citizens of Each State
    A question much mooted before the Civil War was whether the
term could be held to include free Negroes. In the Dred Scott case,171
the Court answered it in the negative. “Citizens of each State,” Chief
Justice Taney argued, meant citizens of the United States as under-
stood at the time the Constitution was adopted, and Negroes were
not then regarded as capable of citizenship. The only category of
national citizenship added under the Constitution comprised aliens,
naturalized in accordance with acts of Congress.172 In dissent, Jus-
tice Curtis not only denied the Chief Justice’s assertion that there
were no Negro citizens of states in 1789 but further argued that,
although Congress alone could determine what classes of aliens should
be naturalized, the states retained the right to extend citizenship
to classes of persons born within their borders who had not previ-
ously enjoyed citizenship and that one upon whom state citizen-
ship was thus conferred became a citizen of the state in the full
sense of the Constitution.173 So far as persons born in the United

the “mutually reinforcing relationship” between the Commerce Clause and the Privi-
leges and Immunities Clause. Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper, 470 U.S.
274, 280 n.8 (1985) (quoting Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.S. 518, 531 (1978)). See, e.g.,
Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 424 U.S. 366 (1976) (city protectionist ordinance
that disadvantages both out-of-state producers and some in-state producers violates
the Commerce Clause).
