sary, in order to carry into effect in a state the judgment of a court
of a sister state, to institute a fresh action in the court of the for-
mer, in strict compliance with its laws; and that, consequently, when
remedies were sought in support of the rights accruing in another
jurisdiction, they were governed by the lex fori. In accord with this
holding, the Court further held that foreign judgments enjoy, not
the right of priority or privilege or lien that they have in the state
where they are pronounced but only what the lex fori gives them
by its own laws, in their character of foreign judgments.9 A judg-
ment of a state court, in a cause within its jurisdiction, and against
a defendant lawfully summoned, or against lawfully attached prop-
erty of an absent defendant, is entitled to as much force and effect
against the person summoned or the property attached, when the
question is presented for decision in a court in another state, as it
has in the state in which it was rendered.10
     A judgment enforceable in the state where rendered must be
given effect in another state, notwithstanding that the modes of pro-
cedure to enforce its collection may not be the same in both states.11
If the initial court acquired jurisdiction, its judgment is entitled to
full faith and credit elsewhere even though the former, by reason
of the departure of the defendant with all his property, after hav-
ing been served, has lost its capacity to enforce it by execution in
the state of origin.12 “A cause of action on a judgment is different
from that upon which the judgment was entered. In a suit upon a
money judgment for a civil cause of action, the validity of the claim
upon which it was founded is not open to inquiry, whatever its gen-
esis. Regardless of the nature of the right which gave rise to it, the
judgment is an obligation to pay money in the nature of a debt upon
a specialty. Recovery upon it can be resisted only on the grounds
that the court which rendered it was without jurisdiction, . . . or
that it has ceased to be obligatory because of payment or other dis-
charge . . . or that it is a cause of action for which the State of the
forum has not provided a court.” 13
     On the other hand, the clause is not violated when a judgment
is disregarded because it is not conclusive of the issues before a
court of the forum. Conversely, no greater effect can be given than
