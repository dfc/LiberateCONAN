       ate, legislative courts whose jurisdiction is derived from statutes en-
       acted pursuant to this section other than from Article III.328 Such
       courts may exercise admiralty jurisdiction despite the fact that such
       jurisdiction may be exercised in the states only by constitutional
       courts.329

    SECTION 4. The United States shall guarantee to every State
in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall pro-
tect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the
Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot
be convened) against domestic Violence.

                              GOVERNMENT
          The first clause of this section, in somewhat different language,
       was contained in the Virginia Plan introduced in the Convention
       and was obviously attributable to Madison.330 Through the various
       permutations into its final form,331 the object of the clause seems

       22 (rev. ed. 1937). In a letter in April, 1787, to Randolph, who formally presented
       the Virginia Plan to the Convention, Madison had suggested that “an article ought
       to be inserted expressly guaranteeing the tranquility of the states against internal
       as well as external danger. . . . Unless the Union be organized efficiently on repub-
       lican principles innovations of a much more objectionable form may be obtruded.” 2

            331 Thus, on June 11, the language of the provision was on Madison’s motion

       changed to: “Resolved that a republican constitution and its existing laws ought to
       be guaranteed to each state by the United States.” 1 M. FARRAND, THE RECORDS OF THE
       FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 193–194, 206 (rev. ed. 1937). Then, on July 18, Gouverneur
       Morris objected to this language on the ground that “[h]e should be very unwilling
       that such laws as exist in R. Island ought to be guaranteed to each State of the
       Union.” 2 id. at 47. Madison then suggested language “that the Constitutional au-
       thority of the States shall be guaranteed to them respectively against domestic as
