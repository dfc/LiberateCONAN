The current understanding is that the Full Faith and Credit Clause
is “exacting” with respect to final judgments of courts, but “is less
demanding with respect to choice of laws.” 107
    The Court has explained that, where a statute or policy of the
forum state is set up as a defense to a suit brought under the stat-
ute of another state or territory, or where a foreign statute is set
up as a defense to a suit or proceedings under a local statute, the
conflict is to be resolved, not by giving automatic effect to the Full
Faith and Credit Clause and thus compelling courts of each state
to subordinate their own statutes to those of others, but by weigh-
ing the governmental interests of each jurisdiction.108 That is, the
Full Faith and Credit Clause, in its design to transform the states
from independent sovereigns into a single unified nation, directs that
a state, when acting as the forum for litigation having multistate
aspects or implications, respect the legitimate interests of other states
and avoid infringement upon their sovereignty. But because the fo-
rum state is also a sovereign in its own right, in appropriate cases
it may attach paramount importance to its own legitimate inter-
ests.109 In order for a state’s substantive law to be selected in a
constitutionally permissible manner, that state must have a signifi-
cant contact or significant aggregation of contacts, creating state in-
terests, such that choice of its law is neither arbitrary nor funda-
mentally unfair.110 Once that threshold is met, the Court will not
weigh the competing interests. “[T]he question of which sovereign
interest should be deemed more weighty is not one that can be eas-
ily answered,” the Court explained, “declin[ing] to embark on the

debts of the enacting state to prevent another state (the state in which the creditor
resided) from taxing the debts. See also Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.)

ity of an act of the legislature of another state is not in question, and the contro-
versy turns merely upon its interpretation or construction, no question arises under
the Full Faith and Credit Clause. See also Western Life Indemnity Co. v. Rupp, 235
