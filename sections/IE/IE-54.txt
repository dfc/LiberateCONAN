        master or the slave; by it the state simply prescribed a rule of con-

    SECTION 3. Clause 1. New States may be admitted by the Con-
gress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected
within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed
by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, with-
out the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as
well as of the Congress.
                    DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF STATES
            “Equality of constitutional right and power is the condition of
        all the States of the Union, old and new.” 258 This doctrine, now a
        truism of constitutional law, did not find favor in the Constitu-
        tional Convention. That body struck out from this section, as re-
        ported by the Committee on Detail, two sections to the effect that
        “new States shall be admitted on the same terms with the original
        States. But the Legislature may make conditions with the new States
        concerning the public debt which shall be subsisting.” 259 Opposing
        this action, Madison insisted that “the Western States neither would
        nor ought to submit to a union which degraded them from an equal
        rank with the other States.” 260 Nonetheless, after further expres-
        sions of opinion pro and con, the Convention voted nine states to
        two to delete the requirement of equality.261
            Prior to this time, however, Georgia and Virginia had ceded to
        the United States large territories held by them, upon condition that
        new states should be formed therefrom and admitted to the Union
        on an equal footing with the original states.262 Since the admission
        of Tennessee in 1796, Congress has included in each state’s act of
            257  Moore v. Illinois, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 13, 17 (1853).

             262 Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 212, 221 (1845). The Continental Con-

        gress in responding in the Northwest Ordinance, on July 13, 1787, provided that
        when each of the designated states in the territorial area achieved a population of
        60,000 free inhabitants it was to be admitted “on an equal footing with the original
        States, in all respects whatever.” An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory
