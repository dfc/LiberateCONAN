the basis for an action for enforcement through the courts of a sis-
ter state but merely as a defense in a collateral action? As the law
stood in 1873, it apparently could not.45 All difficulties, neverthe-
less, to its consideration of the challenge to jurisdiction in the case
were brushed aside by the Court. Whenever, it said, the record of a
judgment rendered in a state court is offered “in evidence” by ei-
ther of the parties to an action in another state, it may be contra-
dicted as to the facts necessary to sustain the former court’s juris-
diction; “and if it be shown that such facts did not exist, the record
will be a nullity, notwithstanding the claim that they did exist.” 46

Divorce Decrees: Domicile as the Jurisdictional
  Prerequisite
    This, however, was only the beginning of the Court’s lawmak-
ing in cases in rem. The most important class of such cases is that
in which the respondent to a suit for divorce offers in defense an
earlier decree from the courts of a sister state. By the almost uni-
versally accepted view prior to 1906, a proceeding in divorce was
one against the marriage status, i.e., in rem, and hence might be
validly brought by either party in any state where he or she was
bona fide domiciled; 47 and, conversely, when the plaintiff did not
have a bona fide domicile in the state, a court could not render a
decree binding in other states even if the nonresident defendant en-
tered a personal appearance.48
    Divorce Suit: In Rem or in Personam; Judicial Indeci-
sion.—In 1906, however, by a vote of five to four, the Court de-
parted from its earlier ruling, rendered five years previously in
Atherton v. Atherton,49 and in Haddock v. Haddock,50 it announced
that a divorce proceeding might be viewed as one in personam. In
the former case it was held, in the latter case denied, that a di-
vorce granted a husband without personal service upon the wife,
who at the time was residing in another state, was entitled to rec-

    46  See also Simmons v. Saul, 138 U.S. 439, 448 (1891). In other words, the chal-
lenge to jurisdiction is treated as equivalent to the plea nul tiel record, a plea that
was recognized even in Mills v. Duryee as available against an attempted invoca-
tion of the full faith and credit clause. What is not pointed out by the Court is that
it was also assumed in the earlier case that such a plea could always be rebutted by
producing a transcript, properly authenticated in accordance with the act of Con-
gress, of the judgment in the original case. See also Brown v. Fletcher’s Estate, 210
