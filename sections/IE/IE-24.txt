or legally attached to the person of the decedent. Such a judgment
is accordingly valid, generally speaking, to distribute the intan-
gible property of the decedent, though the evidences thereof were
actually located elsewhere.91 This is not so, on the other hand, as
to tangibles and realty. In order that the judgment of a probate court
distributing these be entitled to recognition under the Constitu-
tion, they must have been located in the state; as to tangibles and
realty outside the state, the decree of the probate court is entirely
at the mercy of the lex rei sitae.92 So, the probate of a will in one
state, while conclusive in that state, does not displace legal provi-
sions necessary to its validity as a will of real property in other
states.93
    Adoption Decrees.—That a statute legitimizing children born
out of wedlock does not entitle them by the aid of the Full Faith
and Credit Clause to share in the property located in another state
is not surprising, in view of the general principle (to which there
are exceptions) that statutes do not have extraterritorial opera-
tion.94 For the same reason, adoption proceedings in one state are
not denied full faith and credit by the law of the sister state that
excludes children adopted by proceedings in other states from the
right to inherit land in the sister state.95
    Garnishment Decrees.—Garnishment proceedings combine some
of the elements of both an in rem and an in personam action. Sup-
pose that A owes B and B owes C, and that the two former live in
a different state from C. A, while on a brief visit to C’s state, is
presented with a writ attaching his debt to B and also a summons
to appear in court on a named day. The result of the proceedings
thus instituted is that a judgment is entered in C’s favor against A
to the amount of his indebtedness to B. Subsequently A is sued by
B in their home state and offers the judgment, which he has in the
meantime paid, in defense. It was argued on behalf of B that A’s
debt to him had a situs in their home state and furthermore that C
could not have sued B in this same state without formally acquir-
ing a domicile there. Both propositions were, however, rejected by

    91  Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U.S. 1 (1928).
    92  Kerr v. Moon, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 565 (1824); McCormick v. Sullivant, 23 U.S.
(10 Wheat.) 192 (1825); Clarke v. Clarke, 178 U.S. 186 (1900). The controlling prin-
ciple of these cases is not confined to proceedings in probate. A court of equity “not
having jurisdiction of the res cannot affect it by its decree nor by a deed made by a
master in accordance with the decree.” Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1, 11 (1909).
