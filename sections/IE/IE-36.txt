should, if they do not infringe federal law or policy.142 However, the
refusal of a territorial court in Hawaii, which had jurisdiction of
the action on a policy issued by a New York insurance company, to
admit evidence that an administrator had been appointed and a suit
brought by him on a bond in the federal court in New York in which
no judgment had been entered, did not violate this clause.143
    The power to prescribe the effect to be given to the judicial pro-
ceedings of the courts of the United States is conferred by other
provisions of the Constitution, such as those that declare the ex-
tent of the judicial power of the United States, which authorize all
legislation necessary and proper for executing the powers vested by
the Constitution in the Government of the United States, and which
declare the supremacy of the authority of the National Govern-
ment within the limits of the Constitution. As part of its general
authority, the power to give effect to the judgment of its courts is
coextensive with its territorial jurisdiction.144

Evaluation Of Results Under Provision
     The Court, after according an extrastate operation to statutes
and judicial decisions in favor of defendants in transitory actions,
proceeded next to confer the same protection upon certain classes
of defendants in local actions in which the plaintiff ’s claim was the
outgrowth of a relationship formed extraterritorially. But can the
Court stop at this point? If it is true, as Chief Justice Marshall once
remarked, that “the Constitution was not made for the benefit of
plaintiffs alone,” so also it is true that it was not made for the ben-
efit of defendants alone. The day may come when the Court will
approach the question of the relation of the Full Faith and Credit
Clause to the extrastate operation of laws from the same angle as
it today views the broader question of the scope of state legislative
power. When and if this day arrives, state statutes and judicial de-
cisions will be given such extraterritorial operation as seems rea-
sonable to the Court to give them. In short, the rule of the domi-
nance of legal policy of the forum state will be superseded by that
of judicial review.145

“It appears, then, that the Supreme Court has quite definitely committed itself to a
program of making itself, to some extent, a tribunal for bringing about uniformity
