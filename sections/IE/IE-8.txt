ing the remedy, deny enforcement of claims otherwise within the
protection of the full faith and credit clause when its courts have
general jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties; 22 (2) that,
accordingly, a forum state that has a shorter period of limitations
than the state in which a judgment was granted and later revived
erred in concluding that, whatever the effect of the revivor under
the law of the state of origin, it could refuse enforcement of the
revived judgment; 23 (3) that the courts of one state have no juris-
diction to enjoin the enforcement of judgments at law obtained in
another state, when the same reasons assigned for granting the re-
straining order were passed upon on a motion for new trial in the
action at law and the motion denied; 24 (4) that the constitutional
mandate requires credit to be given to a money judgment rendered
in a civil cause of action in another state, even though the forum
state would have been under no duty to entertain the suit on which
the judgment was founded, because a state cannot, by the adoption
of a particular rule of liability or of procedure, exclude from its courts
a suit on a judgment; 25 and (5) that, similarly, tort claimants in
State A who obtain a judgment against a foreign insurance com-
pany, notwithstanding that, prior to judgment, domiciliary State B
appointed a liquidator for the company, vested company assets in
him, and ordered suits against the company stayed, are entitled to
have such judgment recognized in State B for purposes of determin-
ing the amount of the claim, although not for determination of what
priority, if any, their claim should have.26

Jurisdiction: A Prerequisite to Enforcement of Judgments
    The jurisdictional question arises both in connection with judg-
ments in personam against nonresident defendants to whom it is
alleged personal service was not obtained in the state originating
the judgment and in relation to judgments in rem against property
or a status alleged not to have been within the jurisdiction of the

     22 Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629 (1935), approved in Hughes v. Fetter, 341

U.S. 609 (1951).
     23 Union Nat’l Bank v. Lamb, 337 U.S. 38 (1949); see also Roche v. McDonald,

275 U.S. 449 (1928).
     24 Embry v. Palmer, 107 U.S. 3, 13 (1883).
     25 Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282, 291–292 (1939).
     26 Morris v. Jones, 329 U.S. 545 (1947). Moreover, there is no apparent reason

why Congress, acting on the implications of Marshall’s words in Hampton v. McCon-
nell, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 234 (1818), should not clothe extrastate judgments of any
particular type with the full status of domestic judgments of the same type in the
several states. Thus, why should not a judgment for alimony be made directly en-
forceable in sister states instead of merely furnishing the basis of an action in debt?
