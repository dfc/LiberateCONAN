is given in the state where rendered. Thus, an interlocutory judg-
ment may not be given the effect of a final judgment.14 Likewise,
when a federal court does not attempt to foreclose the state court
from hearing all matters of personal defense that landowners might
plead, a state court may refuse to accept the former’s judgment as
determinative of the landowners’ liabilities.15 Similarly, though a con-
fession of judgment upon a note, with a warrant of attorney an-
nexed, in favor of the holder, is in conformity with a state law and
usage as declared by the highest court of the state in which the
judgment is rendered, the judgement may be collaterally im-
peached upon the ground that the party in whose behalf it was ren-
dered was not in fact the holder.16 But a consent decree, which un-
der the law of the state has the same force and effect as a decree
in invitum, must be given the same effect in the courts of another
state.17
    Subsequent to its departure from Hampton v. McConnell,18 the
Court does not appear to have formulated, as a substitute, any clear-
cut principles for disposing of the contention that a state need not
provide a forum for a particular type of judgment of a sister state.
Thus, in one case, it held that a New York statute forbidding for-
eign corporations doing a domestic business to sue on causes origi-
nating outside the state was constitutionally applicable to prevent
such a corporation from suing on a judgment obtained in a sister
state.19 But, in a later case, it ruled that a Mississippi statute for-
bidding contracts in cotton futures could not validly close the courts
of the state to an action on a judgment obtained in a sister state
on such a contract, although the contract in question had been en-
tered into in the forum state and between its citizens.20 Following
the later rather than the earlier precedent, subsequent cases 21 have
held: (1) that a state may adopt such system of courts and form of
remedy as it sees fit but cannot, under the guise of merely affect-

Court in both cases, asserted in his opinion in the latter that the New York statute
was “directed to jurisdiction,” the Mississippi statute to “merits,” but four Justices
could not grasp the distinction.
