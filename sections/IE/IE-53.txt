       brought before the courts of a state for an offense against its laws,
       from trial and punishment, even though he was brought from an-
       other state by unlawful violence,249 or by abuse of legal process,250
       and a fugitive lawfully extradited from another state may be tried
       for an offense other than that for which he was surrendered.251 The
       rule is different, however, with respect to fugitives surrendered by
       a foreign government, pursuant to treaty. In that case the offender
       may be tried only “for the offense with which he is charged in the
       proceedings for his extradition, until a reasonable time and oppor-
       tunity have been given him, after his release or trial upon such charge,
       to return to the country from whose asylum he had been forcibly
       taken under those proceedings.” 252

    Clause 3. No person held to Service or Labour in one State,
under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Conse-
quence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from
such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of
the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.

           This clause contemplated the existence of a positive unquali-
       fied right on the part of the owner of a slave which no state law
       could in any way regulate, control, or restrain. Consequently the
       owner of a slave had the same right to seize and repossess him in
       another state, as the local laws of his own state conferred upon him,
       and a state law that penalized such seizure was held unconstitu-
       tional.253 Congress had the power and the duty, which it exercised
       by the Act of February 12, 1793,254 to carry into effect the rights
       given by this section,255 and the states had no concurrent power to
       legislate on the subject.256 However, a state statute providing a pen-
       alty for harboring a fugitive slave was held not to conflict with this
       clause because it did not affect the right or remedy either of the
