Baker v. Carr,339 despite its substantial curbing of the political ques-
tion doctrine, did not release it.340
     Similarly, in Luther v. Borden,341 the Court indicated that it rested
with Congress to determine the means proper to fulfill the guaran-
tee of protection to the states against domestic violence. Chief Jus-
tice Taney declared that Congress might have placed it in the power
of a court to decide when the contingency had happened that re-
quired the Federal Government to interfere, but that instead Con-
gress had by the act of February 28, 1795,342 authorized the Presi-
dent to call out the militia in case of insurrection against the
government of any state. It followed, said Taney, that the Presi-
dent “must, of necessity, decide which is the government, and which
party is unlawfully arrayed against it, before he can perform the
duty imposed upon him by the act of Congress,” 343 which determi-
nation was not subject to review by the courts.
     In recent years, the authority of the United States to use troops
and other forces in the states has not generally been derived from
this clause and it has been of little importance.




    339 369 U.S. 186, 218–32 (1962). In the Court’s view, Guarantee Clause ques-

tions were nonjusticiable because resolution of them had been committed to Con-
gress and not because they involved matters of state governmental structure.
    340 Subsequently, the Court, speaking through Justice O’Connor, raised without

deciding the possibility that the Guarantee Clause is justiciable and is a constraint
upon Congress’s power to regulate the activities of the states. New York v. United
States, 505 U.S. 144, 183–85 (1992); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 463 (1991).
The opinions draw support from a powerful argument for using the Guarantee Clause
as a judicially enforceable limit on federal power. Merritt, The Guarantee Clause
