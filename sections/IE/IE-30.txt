mine the question in accordance with the constitution, laws and ju-
dicial decisions of the corporation’s home states.118 Illustrative ap-
plications of the latter rule are to be found in the following cases.
A New Jersey statute forbidding an action at law to enforce a stock-
holder’s liability arising under the laws of another state and provid-
ing that such liability may be enforced only in equity, and that in
such a case the corporation, its legal representatives, all its credi-
tors, and stockholders, should be necessary parties, was held not to
preclude an action at law in New Jersey by the New York superin-
tendent of banks against 557 New Jersey stockholders in an insol-
vent New York bank to recover assessments made under the laws
of New York.119 Also, in a suit to enforce double liability, brought in
Rhode Island against a stockholder in a Kansas trust company, the
courts of Rhode Island were held to be obligated to extend recogni-
tion to the statutes and court decisions of Kansas whereunder it is
established that a Kansas judgment recovered by a creditor against
the trust company is not only conclusive as to the liability of the
corporation but also an adjudication binding each stockholder therein.
The only defenses available to the stockholder are those which he
could make in a suit in Kansas.120
     Fraternal Benefit Society: Member Relationship.—The same
principle applies to the relationship that is formed when one takes
out a policy in a “fraternal benefit society.” Thus, in Royal Arcanum
v. Green,121 in which a fraternal insurance association chartered un-
der the laws of Massachusetts had been sued in the courts of New
York by a citizen of the latter state on a contract of insurance made
in that state, the Court held that the defendant company was en-
titled under the full faith and credit clause to have the case deter-
mined in accordance with the laws of Massachusetts and its own
constitution and by-laws as these had been construed by the Mas-
sachusetts courts.
     Nor has the Court manifested any disposition to depart from
this rule. In Sovereign Camp v. Bolin,122 it declared that a state in
which a certificate of life membership of a foreign fraternal benefit
association is issued, which construes and enforces the certificate
according to its own law rather than according to the law of the
state in which the association is domiciled, denies full faith and credit
