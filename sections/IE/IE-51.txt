the demands of those laws may be satisfied before the duty of obe-
dience to the requisition arises.228 But, in Kentucky v. Dennison,229
the Court held that this statute was merely declaratory of a moral
duty; that the Federal Government “has no power to impose on a
State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to per-
form it, ” 230 and consequently that a federal court could not issue a
mandamus to compel the governor of one state to surrender a fugi-
tive to another. Long considered a constitutional derelict, Dennison
was finally formally overruled in 1987.231 Now, states and territo-
ries may invoke the power of federal courts to enforce against state
officers this and other rights created by federal statute, including
equitable relief to compel performance of federally imposed du-
ties.232
    Fugitive From Justice Defined.—To be a fugitive from jus-
tice within the meaning of this clause, it is necessary that, in the
regular course of judicial proceedings, one have been charged with
a crime, but it is not necessary that one have left the state after
having been charged. It is sufficient that, having been charged with
a crime in one state, one is found in another state.233 And the mo-
tive that induced the departure is immaterial.234 Even if a fugitive
were brought involuntarily into the state where found by requisi-
tion from another state, he may be surrendered to a third state upon
an extradition warrant.235 A person indicted a second time for the
same offense is nonetheless a fugitive from justice by reason of the
fact that after dismissal of the first indictment, on which he was
originally indicted, he left the state with the knowledge of, or with-
out objection by, state authorities.236 But a defendant cannot be ex-
tradited if he was only constructively present in the demanding state
