did not make a personal appearance.71 The Court found the prin-
ciple of Estin v. Estin 72 inapplicable. In Simons, the Court rejected
the contention that the forum court, in giving recognition to the for-
eign court’s separation decree providing for maintenance and sup-
port, has to allow for dower rights in the deceased husband’s estate
in the forum state.73 Full faith and credit is not denied to a sister
state’s separation decree, including an award of monthly alimony,
where nothing in the foreign state’s separation decree could be con-
strued as creating or preserving any interest in the nature of or in
lieu of dower in any property of the decedent, wherever located and
where the law of the forum state did not treat such a decree as
having such effect nor indicate such an effect irrespective of the ex-
istence of the foreign state’s decree.74
     Decrees Awarding Alimony, Custody of Children.—A by-
product of divorce litigation are decrees for the payment of ali-
mony, judgments for accrued and unpaid installments of alimony,
and judicial awards of the custody of children, all of which necessi-
tate application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause when extrastate
enforcement is sought for them. Thus, a judgment in State A for
alimony in arrears and payable under a prior judgment of separa-
tion that is not by its terms conditional nor subject by the law of
State A to modification or recall, and on which execution was di-
rected to issue, is entitled to recognition in the forum state. Al-
though an obligation for accrued alimony could have been modified
or set aside in State A prior to its merger in the judgment, such a
judgment, by the law of State A, is not lacking in finality.75 As to
the finality of alimony decrees in general, the Court had previously
ruled that where such a decree is rendered, payable in future in-
stallments, the right to such installments becomes absolute and vested
on becoming due, provided no modification of the decree has been
made prior to the maturity of the installments.76 However, a judi-
cial order requiring the payment of arrearages in alimony, which
exceeded the alimony previously decreed, is invalid for want of due
process, the respondent having been given no opportunity to con-
test it.77 “A judgment obtained in violation of procedural due pro-
