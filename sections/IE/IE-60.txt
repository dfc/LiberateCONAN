       der the three mile belt, Texas, which concededly did own this soil
       before its annexation to the United States, was held to have surren-
       dered its dominion and sovereignty over it, upon entering the Union
       on terms of equality with the existing states. To this extent, the
       earlier rule that unless otherwise declared by Congress the title to
       every species of property owned by a territory passes to the state
       upon admission 295 has been qualified. However, when Congress,
       through passage of the Submerged Lands Act of 1953,296 surren-
       dered its paramount rights to natural resources in the marginal seas
       to certain states, without any corresponding cession to all states,
       the transfer was held to entail no abdication of national sover-
       eignty over control and use of the oceans in a manner destructive
       of the equality of the states.297
           While the territorial status continues, the United States has power
       to convey property rights, such as rights in soil below the high-
       water mark along navigable waters,298 or the right to fish in desig-
       nated waters,299 which will be binding on the state.

   Clause 2. The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and
make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Terri-
tory or other Property belonging to the United States; and noth-
ing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice
any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.
          PROPERTY AND TERRITORY: POWERS OF CONGRESS

       Methods of Disposing of Property
           The Constitution is silent as to the methods of disposing of prop-
       erty of the United States. In United States v. Gratiot,300 in which
       the validity of a lease of lead mines on government lands was put
           295  Brown v. Grant, 116 U.S. 207, 212 (1886).
           296  67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. §§ 1301–1315.
            297 Alabama v. Texas, 347 U.S. 272, 274–77, 281 (1954). Justice Black and Doug-

       las dissented.
            298 Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1, 47 (1894). See also Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U.S.

       332 (1906).
            299 United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 378 (1905); Seufert Bros. v. United

       States, 249 U.S. 194 (1919). A fishing right granted by treaty to Indians does not
       necessarily preclude the application to Indians of state game laws regulating the
       time and manner of taking fish. New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker, 241 U.S. 556
       (1916). See also Metlakatla Indians v. Egan, 369 U.S. 45, 54, 57–59 (1962); Kake
       Village v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 64–65, 67–69, 75–76 (1962). But it has been held to be
       violated by exacting a license fee that is both regulatory and revenue-producing. Tulee
       v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681 (1942).
            300 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 526 (1840).
