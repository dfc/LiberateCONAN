by other States; it gives them the right of free ingress into other
States, and egress from them; it insures to them in other States
the same freedom possessed by the citizens of those States in the
acquisition and enjoyment of property and in the pursuit of happi-
ness; and it secures to them in other States the equal protection of
their laws.” 161
     The cases continue to emphasize that this clause is tied to co-
mity and promoting the Union. “Some distinctions between resi-
dents and nonresidents merely reflect the fact that this is a Nation
composed of individual States, and are permitted; other distinc-
tions are prohibited because they hinder the formation, the pur-
pose, or the development of a single Union of those States. Only
with respect to those ‘privileges’ and ‘immunities’ bearing upon the
vitality of the Nation as a single entity must the State treat all
citizens, resident and nonresident, equally.” 162 In this regard, the
clause primarily “was intended to create a national economic union,”
but it also has been cited as protecting common noneconomic inter-
ests.163
    Hostile discrimination against all nonresidents infringes the
clause,164 but controversies between a state and its own citizens are
not covered by the provision.165 However, a municipality’s discrimi-
nation, approved by the state, in favor of its own residents impli-
cates the clause as to out-of-state residents, even though the disfa-
vored class consists of in-state residents as well.166 The clause should
not be read so literally, the Court held, as to permit states to ex-
clude out-of-state residents from benefits through the simple expe-
