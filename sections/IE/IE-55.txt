admission a clause providing that the state enters the Union “on
an equal footing with the original States in all respects what-
ever.” 263 With the admission of Louisiana in 1812, the principle of
equality was extended to states created out of territory purchased
from a foreign power.264 By the Joint Resolution of December 29,
1845, Texas, then an independent Nation, “was admitted into the
Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects
whatever.” 265
    However, if the doctrine rested merely on construction of the
declarations in the admission acts, then the conditions and limita-
tions imposed by Congress and agreed to by the states in order to
be admitted would nonetheless govern, since they must be con-
strued along with the declarations. Again and again, however, in
adjudicating the rights and duties of states admitted after 1789,
the Supreme Court has referred to the condition of equality as if it
were an inherent attribute of the Federal Union.266 That the doc-
trine is of constitutional stature was made evident at least by the
time of the decision in Pollard’s Lessee, if not before.267 Pollard’s
Lessee involved conflicting claims by the United States and Ala-
bama of ownership of certain partially inundated lands on the shore
of the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama. The enabling act for Alabama
had contained both a declaration of equal footing and a reservation
to the United States of these lands.268 Rather than an issue of mere
land ownership, the Court saw the question as one concerning sov-
ereignty and jurisdiction of the states. Because the original states
retained sovereignty and jurisdiction over the navigable waters and
the soil beneath them within their boundaries, retention by the United
States of either title to or jurisdiction over common lands in the
new states would bring those states into the Union on less than an
equal footing with the original states. This, the Court would not
permit. “Alabama is, therefore, entitled to the sovereignty and ju-
risdiction over all the territory within her limits, subject to the com-
mon law, to the same extent that Georgia possessed it, before she
