in issue, the contention was advanced that “disposal is not letting
or leasing,” and that Congress has no power “to give or authorize
leases.” The Court sustained the leases, saying “the disposal must
be left to the discretion of Congress.” 301 Nearly a century later this
power to dispose of public property was relied upon to uphold the
generation and sale of electricity by the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity. The reasoning of the Court ran thus: the potential electrical en-
ergy made available by the construction of a dam in the exercise of
its constitutional powers is property which the United States is en-
titled to reduce to possession; to that end it may install the equip-
ment necessary to generate such energy. In order to widen the mar-
ket and make a more advantageous disposition of the product, it
may construct transmission lines and may enter into a contract with
a private company for the interchange of electric energy.302

Public Lands: Federal and State Powers Thereover
     No appropriation of public lands may be made for any purpose
except by authority of Congress.303 However, Congress was held to
have acquiesced in the long-continued practice of withdrawing land
from the public domain by Executive Orders.304 In 1976 Congress
enacted legislation that established procedures for withdrawals and
that explicitly disclaimed continued acquiescence in any implicit ex-
ecutive withdrawal authority.305 The comprehensive authority of Con-
gress over public lands includes the power to prescribe the times,
conditions, and mode of transfer thereof and to designate the per-
sons to whom the transfer shall be made,306 to declare the dignity
and effect of titles emanating from the United States,307 to deter-
mine the validity of grants which antedate the government’s acqui-
sition of the property,308 to exempt lands acquired under the home-
stead laws from previously contracted debts,309 to withdraw land
