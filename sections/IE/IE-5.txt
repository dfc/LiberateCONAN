question of the merits of the original case by a plea of “nil debet.”
It was answered in the words of the first implementing statute of
1790 5 that such records and proceedings were entitled in each state
to the same faith and credit as in the state of origin, and that, as
they were records of a court in the state of origin, and so conclu-
sive of the merits of the case there, they were equally so in the
forum state. The Court found that it had not been the intention of
the Constitution merely to reenact the common law—that is, the
principles of private international law—with regard to the recep-
tion of foreign judgments, but to amplify and fortify these.6 Some
years later, in Hampton v. McConnell,7 Chief Justice Marshall went
even further, using language that seems to show that he regarded
the judgment of a state court as constitutionally entitled to be ac-
corded in the courts of sister states not simply the faith and credit
on conclusive evidence but the validity of final judgment.
    When, however, the next important case arose, the Court had
come under new influences. This case was McElmoyle v. Cohen,8 in
which the issue was whether a statute of limitations of the State of
Georgia, which applied only to judgments obtained in courts other
than those of Georgia, could constitutionally bar an action in Geor-
gia on a judgment rendered by a court of record of South Carolina.
Declining to follow Marshall’s lead in Hampton v. McConnell, the
Court held that the Constitution was not intended “materially to
interfere with the essential attributes of the lex fori,” that the act
of Congress only established a rule of evidence—of conclusive evi-
dence to be sure, but still of evidence only; and that it was neces-
     5 Chap. XI, 1 Stat. 122 (“records and judicial proceedings authenticated as afore-

said, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United
States, as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said
records are or shall be taken”).
     6 On the same basis, a judgment cannot be impeached either in or out of the

state by showing that it was based on a mistake of law. American Express Co. v.
Mullins, 212 U.S. 311, 312 (1909). Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230 (1908); Hartford
Life Ins. Co. v. Ibs, 237 U.S. 662 (1915); Hartford Life Ins. Co. v. Barber, 245 U.S.
146 (1917).
     7 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 234 (1818).
     8 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 312 (1839). See also Townsend v. Jemison, 50 U.S. (9 How.)

407, 413–20 (1850); Bank of Alabama v. Dalton, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 522, 528 (1850);
Bacon v. Howard, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 22, 25 (1858); Christmas v. Russell, 72 U.S. (5
Wall.) 290, 301 (1866); Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., 127 U.S. 265, 292 (1888); Great
Western Tel. Co. v. Purdy, 162 U.S. 329 (1896); Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., 345
U.S. 514, 516–18 (1953). Subsequently, the Court reconsidered and adhered to the
rule of these cases, although the Justices divided with respect to rationales. Sun Oil
Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.S. 717 (1988). Acknowledging that in some areas it had treated
statutes of limitations as substantive rules, such as in diversity cases to insure uni-
formity with state law in federal courts, the Court ruled that such rules are proce-
dural for full-faith-and-credit purposes, since “[t]he purpose . . . of the Full Faith
and Credit Clause . . . is . . . to delimit spheres of state legislative competence.” Id.
