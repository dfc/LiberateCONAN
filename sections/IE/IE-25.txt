Penal Judgments: Types Entitled to Recognition
    The Full Faith and Credit Clause has been interpreted in the
light of the “incontrovertible maxim” that “the courts of no country
execute the penal laws of another.” 97 In the leading case of Hun-
tington v. Attrill,98 however, the Court so narrowly defined “penal”
in this connection as to make it substantially synonymous with “crimi-
nal” and on this basis held a judgment which had been recovered
under a state statute making the officers of a corporation who signed
and recorded a false certificate of the amount of its capital stock
liable for all of its debts to be entitled under Article IV, § 1, to rec-
ognition and enforcement in the courts of sister states. Nor, in gen-
eral, is a judgment for taxes to be denied full faith and credit in
state and federal courts merely because it is for taxes. In Nelson v.
George,99 in which a prisoner was tried in California and North Caro-
lina and convicted and sentenced in both states for various felo-
nies, the Court determined that the Full Faith and Credit Clause
did not require California to enforce a penal judgment handed down
by North Carolina; California was free to consider what effect if any
it would give to the North Carolina detainer.100 Until the obliga-
tion to extradite matured, the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not
require California to enforce the North Carolina penal judgment in
any way.

Fraud as a Defense to Suits on Foreign Judgments
    With regard to whether recognition of a state judgment can be
refused by the forum state on other than jurisdictional grounds, there
are dicta to the effect that judgments for which extraterritorial op-
eration is demanded under Article IV, § 1 and acts of Congress are
“impeachable for manifest fraud.” But unless the fraud affected the
jurisdiction of the court, the vast weight of authority is against the
