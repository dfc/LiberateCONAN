Property Rights of States to Soil Under Navigable Waters
     The “equal footing” doctrine has had an important effect on the
property rights of new states to soil under navigable waters 289 and
tidally influenced waters.290 In Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan,291 as was
observed above, the Court held that the original states had re-
served to themselves the ownership of the shores of navigable wa-
ters and the soils under them, and that under the principle of equal-
ity the title to the soils beneath navigable water passes to a new
state upon admission. The principle of this case, which also applies
to tidally influenced waters, supplies the rule of decision in many
property-claims cases.292
     After refusing to extend the inland-water rule of Pollard’s Les-
see to the three mile marginal belt under the ocean along the coast,293
the Court applied the principle in reverse in United States v. Texas.294
Because the original states had been found not to own the soil un-
