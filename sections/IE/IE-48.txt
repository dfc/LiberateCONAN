expiration of the time for suit in the place where the cause of ac-
tion arose 209 and another such statute which that suspended its
operation as to resident plaintiffs, but not as to nonresidents, dur-
ing the period of the defendant’s absence from the state.210 A state
law making it discretionary with the courts to entertain an action
by a nonresident of the state against a foreign corporation doing
business in the state was sustained because it was applicable alike
to citizens and noncitizens residing out of the state.211 A statute per-
mitting a suit in the courts of the state for wrongful death occur-
ring outside the state, only if the decedent was a resident of the
state, was sustained, because it operated equally upon representa-
tives of the deceased whether citizens or noncitizens.212 Being pa-
tently nondiscriminatory, a Uniform Reciprocal State Law to se-
cure the attendance of witnesses from within or without a state in
criminal proceedings, whereunder an Illinois resident, while tempo-
rarily in Florida, was summoned to appear at a hearing for deter-
mination as to whether he should be surrendered to a New York
officer for testimony in the latter state, does not violate this clause.213

Taxation
    In the exercise of its taxing power, a state may not discrimi-
nate substantially between residents and nonresidents. In Ward v.
Maryland,214 the Court set aside a state law that imposed specific
taxes upon nonresidents for the privilege of selling within the state
goods that were produced in other states. Also found to be incom-
patible with the comity clause was a Tennessee license tax, the amount
of which was dependent upon whether the person taxed had his
chief office within or without the state.215 In Travis v. Yale & Towne
Mfg. Co.,216 the Court, although sustaining the right of a state to
tax income accruing within its borders to nonresidents,217 held the
particular tax void because it denied to nonresidents exemptions which
were allowed to residents. The “terms ‘resident’ and ‘citizen’ are not

v. New Hampshire, 420 U.S. 656 (1975), the Court held void a state commuter in-
come tax, inasmuch as the State imposed no income tax on its own residents and
thus the tax fell exclusively on nonresidents’ income and was not offset even approxi-
mately by other taxes imposed upon residents alone.
