personal rights to which the clause admittedly extends are not in
all cases beyond the reach of state legislation which differentiates
citizens and noncitizens. Broadly speaking, these rights are held sub-
ject to the reasonable exercise by a state of its police power, and
the Court has recognized that there are cases in which discrimina-
tion against nonresidents may be reasonably resorted to by a state
in aid of its own public health, safety and welfare. To that end a
state may reserve the right to sell insurance to persons who have
resided within the state for a prescribed period of time.200 It may
require a nonresident who does business within the state 201 or who
uses the highways of the state 202 to consent, expressly or by impli-
cation, to service of process on an agent within the state. Without
violating this section, a state may limit the dower rights of a non-
resident to lands of which the husband died seized while giving a
resident dower in all lands held during the marriage,203 or may leave
the rights of nonresident married persons in respect of property within
the state to be governed by the laws of their domicile, rather than
by the laws it promulgates for its own residents.204 But a state may
not give a preference to resident creditors in the administration of
the property of an insolvent foreign corporation.205 An act of the
Confederate Government, enforced by a state, to sequester a debt
owed by one of its residents to a citizen of another state was held
to be a flagrant violation of this clause.206

Access to Courts
     The right to sue and defend in the courts is one of the highest
and most essential privileges of citizenship and must be allowed by
each state to the citizens of all other states to the same extent that
it is allowed to its own citizens.207 The constitutional requirement
is satisfied if the nonresident is given access to the courts of the
state upon terms that, in themselves, are reasonable and adequate
for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may
not be technically the same as those accorded to resident citi-
zens.208 The Supreme Court upheld a state statute of limitations
that prevented a nonresident from suing in the stateâ€™s courts after
