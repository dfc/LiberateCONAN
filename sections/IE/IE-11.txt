confer jurisdiction over the corporation,40 that the question whether
the corporation was actually “doing business” in the state may be
raised.41 On the other hand, the fact that the business was inter-
state is no objection.42
    Service on Nonresident Motor Vehicle Owners.—By anal-
ogy to the above cases, it has been held that a state may require
nonresident owners of motor vehicles to designate an official within
the state as an agent upon whom process may be served in any
legal proceedings growing out of their operation of a motor vehicle
within the state.43 Although these cases arose under the Four-
teenth Amendment alone, unquestionably a judgment validly ob-
tained upon this species of service could be enforced upon the owner
of a car through the courts of his home state.
    Judgments in Rem.—In sustaining the challenge to jurisdic-
tion in cases involving judgments in personam, the Court in the main
was making only a somewhat more extended application of recog-
nized principles. In order to sustain the same kind of challenge in
cases involving judgments in rem it has had to make law outright.
The leading case is Thompson v. Whitman.44 Thompson, sheriff of
Monmouth County, New Jersey, acting under a New Jersey stat-
ute, had seized a sloop belonging to Whitman and by a proceeding
in rem had obtained its condemnation and forfeiture in a local court.
Later, Whitman, a citizen of New York, brought an action for tres-
pass against Thompson in the United States Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York, and Thompson answered by produc-
ing a record of the proceedings before the New Jersey tribunal. Whit-
man thereupon set up the contention that the New Jersey court
had acted without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the sloop which was
the subject matter of the proceedings had been seized outside the
county to which, by the statute under which it had acted, its juris-
diction was confined.
    As previously explained, the plea of lack of privity cannot be
set up in defense in a sister state against a judgment in rem. In a
proceeding in rem, however, the presence of the res within the court’s
jurisdiction is a prerequisite, and this, it was urged, had not been
the case in Thompson v. Whitman. Could, then, the Court consider
this challenge with respect to a judgment which was offered, not as
