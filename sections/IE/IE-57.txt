legislation after admission.273 Thus, Congress may embrace in an
admitting act a regulation of commerce among the states or with
Indian tribes or rules for the care and disposition of the public lands
or reservations within a state. “[I]n every such case such legisla-
tion would derive its force not from any agreement or compact with
the proposed new State, nor by reason of its acceptance of such en-
actment as a term of admission, but solely because the power of
Congress extended to the subject, and, therefore, would not operate
to restrict the State’s legislative power in respect of any matter which
was not plainly within the regulating power of Congress.” 274
     Until recently the requirement of equality has applied primar-
ily to political standing and sovereignty rather than to economic or
property rights.275 Broadly speaking, every new state is entitled to
exercise all the powers of government which belong to the original
states of the Union.276 It acquires general jurisdiction, civil and crimi-
nal, for the preservation of public order, and the protection of per-
sons and property throughout its limits even as to federal lands,
except where the Federal Government has reserved 277 or the state
has ceded some degree of jurisdiction to the United States, and, of
course, no state may enact a law that would conflict with the con-
stitutional powers of the United States. Consequently, it has juris-
diction to tax private activities carried on within the public domain
(although not to tax the Federal lands), if the tax does not consti-
tute an unconstitutional burden on the Federal Government.278 Stat-
utes applicable to territories, e.g., the Northwest Territory Ordi-
nance of 1787, cease to have any operative force when the territory,
or any part thereof, is admitted to the Union, except as adopted by
