        the value of the real estate owned by the corporation.223 Occasional
        or accidental inequality to a nonresident taxpayer is not sufficient
        to defeat a scheme of taxation whose operation is generally equi-
        table.224 In an early case the Court brushed aside as frivolous the
        contention that a state violated this clause by subjecting one of its
        own citizens to a property tax on a debt due from a nonresident
        secured by real estate situated where the debtor resided.225

     Clause 2. A person charged in any State with Treason, Felony,
or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in an-
other State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the
State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the
State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.
                                 INTERSTATE RENDITION

        Duty to Surrender Fugitives From Justice
            Although this provision is not in its nature self-executing, and
        there is no express grant to Congress of power to carry it into ef-
        fect, that body passed a law shortly after the Constitution was ad-
        opted, imposing upon the governor of each state the duty to deliver
        up fugitives from justice found in such state.226 The Supreme Court
        has accepted this contemporaneous construction as establishing the
        validity of this legislation.227 The duty to surrender is not absolute
        and unqualified; if the laws of the state to which the fugitive has
        fled have been put in force against him, and he is imprisoned there,

        U.S. 404 (1935), in which discriminatory taxation of bank deposits outside the state
        owned by a citizen of the state was held to infringe a privilege of national citizen-
        ship, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. Colgate v. Harvey was over-
        ruled by Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U.S. 83, 93 (1940).
             226 1 Stat. 302 (1793), 18 U.S.C. § 3182. The Act requires rendition of fugitives

        at the request of a demanding “Territory,” as well as of a State, thus extending be-
        yond the terms of the clause. In New York ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham, 211 U.S. 468
        (1909), the Court held that the legislative extension was permissible under the ter-
        ritorial clause. See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U.S. 219, 229–230 (1987).
             227 Roberts v. Reilly, 116 U.S. 80, 94 (1885). See also Innes v. Tobin, 240 U.S.

        127 (1916). Justice Story wrote: “[T]he natural, if not the necessary conclusion is,
        that the national government, in the absence of all positive provisions to the con-
        trary, is bound, through its own proper departments, legislative, judicial, or execu-
        tive, as the case may require, to carry into effect all the rights and duties imposed
        upon it by the Constitution”; and again, “it has, on various occasions, exercised pow-
        ers which were necessary and proper as means to carry into effect rights expressly
        given, and duties expressly enjoined thereby.” Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.)
