proposition. Also, it is universally agreed that a judgment may not
be impeached for alleged error or irregularity,101 or as contrary to
the public policy of the state where recognition is sought for it un-
der the Full Faith and Credit Clause.102 Previously listed cases in-
dicate, however, that the Court in fact has permitted local policy to
determine the merits of a judgment under the pretext of regulating
jurisdiction.103 Thus, in Cole v. Cunningham,104 the Court sus-
tained a Massachusetts court in enjoining, in connection with insol-
vency proceedings instituted in that state, a Massachusetts credi-
tor from continuing in New York courts an action that had been
commenced there before the insolvency suit was brought. This was
done on the theory that a party within the jurisdiction of a court
may be restrained from doing something in another jurisdiction op-
posed to principles of equity, it having been shown that the credi-
tor was aware of the debtor’s embarrassed condition when the New
York action was instituted. The injunction unquestionably denied
full faith and credit and commanded the assent of only five Jus-
tices.

           CONSTITUTIONS, STATUTES, COMMON LAW

Development of the Modern Rule
    Although the language of section one suggests that the same
respect should be accorded to “public acts” that is accorded to “judi-
cial proceedings” (“full faith and credit shall be given in each State
to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other
State”), and the Court has occasionally relied on this parity of treat-
ment,105 the Court has usually differentiated “the credit owed to
laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments.” 106

Scott case, drew an analogy to international law, concluding that states, as well as
nations, judge for themselves the rules governing property and persons within their
territories. Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 460 (1857). “One State cannot
exempt property from taxation in another,” the Court concluded in Bonaparte v. Tax
Court, 104 U.S. 592 (1882), holding that no provision of the Constitution, including
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, enabled a law exempting from taxation certain
