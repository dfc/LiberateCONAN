clearly to have been more than an authorization for the Federal
Government to protect states against foreign invasion or internal
insurrection,332 a power seemingly already conferred in any case.333
No one can now resurrect the full meaning of the clause and intent
which moved the Framers to adopt it, but with the exception of the
reliance for a brief period during Reconstruction the authority con-
tained within the confines of the clause has been largely unex-
plored.334
    In Luther v. Borden,335 the Supreme Court established the doc-
trine that questions arising under this section are political, not ju-
dicial, in character and that “it rests with Congress to decide what
government is the established one in a State . . . as well as its re-
publican character.” 336 Texas v. White 337 held that the action of the
President in setting up provisional governments at the conclusion
of the war was justified, if at all, only as an exercise of his powers
as Commander-in-Chief and that such governments were to be re-
garded merely as provisional regimes to perform the functions of
government pending action by Congress. On the ground that the
issues were not justiciable, the Court in the early part of this cen-
tury refused to pass on a number of challenges to state governmen-
tal reforms and thus made the clause in effect noncognizable by the
courts in any matter,338 a status from which the Court’s opinion in

well as foreign violence,” whereas Randolph wanted to add to this the language “and
that no State be at liberty to form any other than a Republican Govt.” Wilson then
moved, “as a better expression of the idea,” almost the present language of the sec-
tion, which was adopted. Id. at 47–49.
     332 Thus, Randolph on June 11, supporting Madison’s version pending then, said

that “a republican government must be the basis of our national union; and no state
in it ought to have it in their power to change its government into a monarchy.” 1
id. at 206. Again, on July 18, when Wilson and Mason indicated their understand-
ing that the object of the proposal was “merely” to protect states against violence,
Randolph asserted: “The Resoln. has 2 Objects. 1. to secure Republican government.
2. to suppress domestic commotions. He urged the necessity of both these provi-
sions.” 2 id. at 47. Following speakers alluded to the dangers of monarchy being
created peacefully as necessitating the provision. Id. at 48. See W. WIECEK, THE GUAR-

(1868), the state attempted to attack Reconstruction legislation on the premise that
it already had a republican form of government and that Congress was thus not
authorized to act. The Court viewed the congressional decision as determinative.
