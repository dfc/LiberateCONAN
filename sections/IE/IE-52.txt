at the time of the commission of the crime charged.237 For the pur-
pose of determining who is a fugitive from justice, the words “trea-
son, felony or other crime” embrace every act forbidden and made
punishable by a law of a state,238 including misdemeanors.239
    Procedure for Removal.—Only after a person has been charged
with a crime in the regular course of judicial proceedings is the gov-
ernor of a state entitled to make demand for his return from an-
other state.240 The person demanded has no constitutional right to
be heard before the governor of the state in which he is found on
the question whether he has been substantially charged with crime
and is a fugitive from justice.241 The constitutionally required sur-
render is not to be interfered with by habeas corpus upon specula-
tions as to what ought to be the result of a trial.242 Nor is it proper
thereby to inquire into the motives controlling the actions of the
governors of the demanding and surrendering states.243 Matters of
defense, such as the running of the statute of limitations,244 or the
contention that continued confinement in the prison of the demand-
ing state would amount to cruel and unjust punishment,245 cannot
be heard on habeas corpus but should be tested in the courts of the
demanding state, where all parties may be heard, where all perti-
nent testimony will be readily available, and where suitable relief,
if any, may be fashioned. A defendant will, however, be discharged
on habeas corpus if he shows by clear and satisfactory evidence that
he was outside the demanding state at the time of the crime.246 If,
however, the evidence is conflicting, habeas corpus is not a proper
proceeding to try the question of alibi.247 The habeas court’s role is,
therefore, very limited.248
    Trial of Fugitives After Removal.—There is nothing in the
Constitution or laws of the United States that exempts an offender,
