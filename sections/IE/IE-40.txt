sons in a free society, the privileges and immunities of free citi-
zens, which no state could deny to citizens of other states, without
regard to the manner in which it treated its own citizens. This theory
found some expression in a few state cases 157 and best accords with
the natural law-natural rights language of Justice Washington in
Corfield v. Coryell.158
     If it had been accepted by the Court, this theory might well have
endowed the Supreme Court with a reviewing power over restric-
tive state legislation as broad as that which it later came to exer-
cise under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Four-
teenth Amendment, but it was firmly rejected by the Court.159 Third,
the clause guarantees to the citizen of any state the rights which
he enjoys as such even when he is sojourning in another state; that
is, it enables him to carry with him his rights of state citizenship
throughout the Union, unembarrassed by state lines. This theory,
too, the Court rejected.160 Fourth, the clause merely forbids any state
to discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of its own.
It is this narrow interpretation that has become the settled one. “It
was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question to place the
citizens of each State upon the same footing with citizens of other
States, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those
States are concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alien-

tion standards on the Federal Government. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954);

circuit), quoted infra, “All Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the Several States.”
“At one time it was thought that this section recognized a group of rights which,
according to the jurisprudence of the day, were classed as ‘natural rights’; and that
the purpose of the section was to create rights of citizens of the United States by
guaranteeing the citizens of every State the recognition of this group of rights by
every other State. Such was the view of Justice Washington.” Hague v. CIO, 307
U.S. 496, 511 (1939) (Justice Roberts for the Court). This view of the clause was
asserted by Justices Field and Bradley, Slaughter House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.)
97, 117–18 (1873) (dissenting opinions); Butchers’ Union Slaughter-House and Live-
Stock Landing Co. v. Crescent City Live-Stock Landing and Slaughter-House Co.,

understood so by Chief Justice Taney. Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 423
(1857). See also id. at 580 (Justice Curtis dissenting). The natural rights concept of
privileges and immunities was strongly held by abolitionists and their congressional
allies who drafted the similar clause into 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Graham,
