     Even if an activity is labeled “fundamental”, a state is not cat-
egorically barred from distinguishing between residents and non-
residents in regulating it: The Privileges and Immunities Clause is
not “an absolute.” 195 Be there a substantial reason for different treat-
ment and a substantial relationship between the means used and
the objective to be achieved, discrimination against nonresidents in
a fundamental activity can stand. This two-part test is not easily
met, however. An Alaska statute giving residents preference over
nonresidents in hiring for work on oil and gas pipelines within the
state failed both elements, because the state did not show that non-
residents constituted a peculiar source of the “evil”, high unemploy-
ment among Native Alaskans, at which the statute was aimed.196
Also failing the test were a New Hampshire rule that limited ad-
mission to the bar to state residents 197 and a Virgin Islands rule
that limited bar membership to attorneys residing in the territory
at least one year.198 The more mixed fate of privileges and immuni-
ties challenges to state tax laws is discussed below.
     One area generally excepted from coverage is core political ac-
tivities. “A State may, by rule uniform in its operation as to citi-
zens of the several States, require residence within its limits for a
given time before a citizen of another State who becomes a resi-
dent thereof shall exercise the right of suffrage or become eligible
to office.” 199

Discrimination in Private Rights
    Not only has judicial construction of the comity clause excluded
certain privileges of a public nature from its protection, but the courts
also have established the proposition that the purely private and

    196  Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.S. 518 (1978). Activity relating to pursuit of an oc-
cupation or common calling, the Court recognized, had long been held to be pro-
tected by the clause. The burden of showing constitutional justification was clearly
placed on the state, id. at 526–28, rather than giving the statute the ordinary pre-
sumption of constitutionality. See Mullaney v. Anderson, 342 U.S. 415, 418 (1952).

     198 Barnard v. Thorstenn, 489 U.S. 546 (1989)(clause made applicable to the Vir-

gin Islands under the Revised Organic Act). The case was brought by nonresidents,
a subset of the disqualified class, and the Court did not address the durational re-
quirements that applied to the separate subset of new residents. Cf. United Build-
ing & Constr. Trades Council v. Mayor of Camden, 465 U.S. 208 (1984). See also

ginia rule that denied nonresident attorneys admission to the bar “on motion.”

ciple is now qualified under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U.S. 371, 383 (1978) (citing
