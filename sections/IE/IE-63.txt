consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested ac-
cording to the laws of the United States.” 319 In construing a convey-
ance by the United States of land within a state, the settled and
reasonable rule of construction of the state affords a guide in deter-
mining what impliedly passes to the grantee as an incident to land
expressly granted.320 But a state statute enacted subsequently to a
federal grant cannot operate to vest in the state rights that either
remained in the United States or passed to its grantee.321

Territories: Powers of Congress Thereover
    In the territories, Congress has the entire dominion and sover-
eignty, national and local, and has full legislative power over all
subjects upon which a state legislature might act.322 It may legis-
late directly with respect to the local affairs of a territory or it may
transfer that function to a legislature elected by the citizens thereof,323
which will then be invested with all legislative power except as lim-
ited by the Constitution of the United States and acts of Con-
gress.324 In 1886, Congress prohibited the enactment by territorial
legislatures of local or special laws on enumerated subjects.325 The
constitutional guarantees of private rights are applicable in territo-
ries which have been made a part of the United States by congres-
sional action 326 but not in unincorporated territories.327 Congress

The guarantees of fundamental rights apply to persons in Puerto Rico, id. at 312–
13, but what these are and how they are to be determined, in light of Balzac’s hold-
ing that the right to a civil jury trial was not protected. The vitality of the Insular
Cases has been questioned by some Justices (Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 14 (1957)
(plurality opinion); Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 474, 475 (1979) (concurring
opinion of four Justices)), but there is no doubt that the Court adheres to it (United
States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 268 (1990); Harris v. Rosario, 446 U.S.
651 (1980)). Applying stateside rights in Puerto Rico are Calero-Toledo v. Pearson
