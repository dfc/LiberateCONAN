capable of foreclosing an action for maintenance or support in an-
other may be different from that required to alter the marital sta-
tus with extraterritorial effect.” 64
     Three years later, but on this occasion speaking for a majority
of the Court, Justice Douglas reiterated these views in Estin v. Estin.65
In this case, a New York court had granted a wife a decree of sepa-
ration and awarded her alimony. Subsequently, in Nevada, her hus-
band obtained an ex parte divorce decree, which made no provision
for alimony. He ceased paying the New York-awarded alimony, and
the wife sued him in New York. The husband argued that the Ne-
vada decree had wiped out the alimony claim, but Justice Douglas
found that “Nevada had no power to adjudicate [the wife’s] rights
in the New York judgment, [and] New York need not give full faith
and credit to that phase of Nevada’s judgment. . . . . The result in
this situation is to make the divorce divisible—to give effect to the
Nevada decree insofar as it affects marital status and to make it
ineffective on the issue of alimony.” 66 Accordingly, the Nevada de-
cree could not prevent New York from applying its own rule of law
which, unlike that of Pennsylvania,67 does permit a support order
to survive a divorce decree.68
    Such a result was justified as “accommodat[ing] the interests
of both Nevada and New York in this broken marriage by restrict-
ing each State to the matters of her dominant concern,” 69 the con-
cern of New York being that of protecting the abandoned wife against
impoverishment. In Simons v. Miami National Bank,70 the Court
held that a dower right in the deceased husband’s estate is extin-
guished even though a divorce decree was obtained in a proceeding
in which the nonresident wife was served by publication only and

     68 Because the record, in his opinion, did not make it clear whether New York

“law” held that no “ex parte” divorce decree could terminate a prior New York sepa-
rate maintenance decree, or merely that no “ex parte” decree of divorce of another
State could, Justice Frankfurter dissented and recommended that the case be re-
manded for clarification. Justice Jackson dissented on the ground that under New
York law, a New York divorce would terminate the wife’s right to alimony, and if the
Nevada decree is good, it was entitled to no less effect in New York than a local
decree. However, for reasons stated in his dissent in the first Williams case, 317
U.S. 287, he would have preferred not to give standing to constructive service di-
vorces obtained on short residence. 334 U.S. 541, 549–54 (1948). These two Justices
