over the place of injury.131 The same result was achieved in a sub-
sequent case, but the Court promulgated a new rule, applied there-
after, which emphasized a balancing of the governmental interests
of each jurisdiction, rather than the mere application of the statu-
tory rule of one or another state under full faith and credit.132 Thus,
the Court held that the clause did not preclude California from dis-
regarding a Massachusetts’s workmen’s compensation statute, mak-
ing its law exclusive of any common law action or any law of any
other jurisdiction, and applying its own act in the case of an injury
suffered by a Massachusetts employee of a Massachusetts em-
ployer while in California in the course of his employment.133 It is
therefore settled that an injured worker may seek a compensation
award either in the state in which the injury occurred or in the
state in which the employee resided, his employer was principally
located, and the employment relation was formed, even if one stat-
ute or the other purported to confer an exclusive remedy on the
workman.134
    Less settled is the question whether a second state, with inter-
ests in the matter, may supplement a workers’ compensation award
provided in the first state. At first, the Court ruled that a Louisi-
ana employee of a Louisiana employer, who was injured on the job
in Texas and who received an award under the Texas act, which
did not grant further recovery to an employee who received compen-
sation under the laws of another state, could not obtain additional
compensation under the Louisiana statute.135 Shortly, however, the
Court departed from this holding, permitting Wisconsin, the state
of the injury, to supplement an award pursuant to the laws of Illi-
nois, where the worker resided and where the employment con-
tract had been entered into.136 Although the second case could have
been factually distinguished from the first,137 the Court instead chose
to depart from the principle of the first, saying that only if the laws
of the first state making an award contained “unmistakable lan-

The state where the employment contract was made was permitted to apply its work-
men’s compensation law despite the provision in the law of the state of injury mak-
ing its law the exclusive remedy for injuries occurring there. See id. at 547 (stating
the balancing test).
