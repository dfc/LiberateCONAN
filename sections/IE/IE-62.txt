from settlement and to prohibit grazing thereon,310 to prevent un-
lawful occupation of public property and to declare what are nui-
sances, as affecting such property, and provide for their abate-
ment,311 and to prohibit the introduction of liquor on lands purchased
and used for an Indian colony.312 Congress may limit the disposi-
tion of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of
public policy. A restriction inserted in a grant of public lands to a
municipality which prohibited the grantee from selling or leasing
to a private corporation the right to sell or sublet water or electric
energy supplied by the facilities constructed on such land was held
valid.313
     Unanimously upholding a federal law to protect wild-roaming
horses and burros on federal lands, the Court restated the appli-
cable principles governing Congress’s power under this clause. It
empowers Congress to act as both proprietor and legislature over
the public domain; Congress has complete power to make those “need-
ful rules” which in its discretion it determines are necessary. When
Congress acts with respect to those lands covered by the clause, its
legislation overrides conflicting state laws.314 Absent action by Con-
gress, however, states may in some instances exercise some jurisdic-
tion over activities on federal lands.315
     No state may tax public lands of the United States within its
borders,316 nor may state legislation interfere with the power of Con-
gress under this clause or embarrass its exercise.317 Thus, by vir-
tue of a Treaty of 1868, according self-government to Navajos liv-
ing on an Indian Reservation in Arizona, the tribal court, rather
than the courts of that state, had jurisdiction over a suit for a debt
owed by an Indian resident thereof to a non-Indian conducting a
store on the reservation under federal license.318 The question whether
title to land that has once been the property of the United States
has passed from it must be resolved by the laws of the United States;
after title has passed, “that property, like all other property in the
state, is subject to the state legislation; so far as that legislation is
