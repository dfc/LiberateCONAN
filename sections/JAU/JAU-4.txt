shortened the terms of Representatives elected to the Seventy-
third Congress, by the interval between January 3 and March 4,
1935, and temporarily modified Article I, § 2, clause 1, fixing the
terms of Representatives at 2 years.
    Section 1 further modifies the Twelfth Amendment in its refer-
ence to March 4 as the date by which the House must exercise its
choice of a President.
    Section 2 supersedes clause 2 of § 4 of Article I. The setting of
an exact hour for meeting constitutes a recognition of the long prac-
tice of Congress, which in 1867 was for the first time enacted into
permanent law,2 only to be repealed in 1871.3
    When the 3d of January fell on Sunday (in 1937), Congress did
by law appoint a different day for its assemblage.4
    Pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by § 3 of this amend-
ment, Congress shaped the Presidential Succession Act of 1948 5 to
meet the situation which would arise from the failure of both Presi-
dent elect and Vice President elect to qualify on or before the time
fixed for the beginning of the new Presidential term.
