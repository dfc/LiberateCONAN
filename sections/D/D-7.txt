with a membership of 355, endorsed the new Constitution, but recom-
mended that a bill of rights be added to protect the States from federal en-
croachment on individual liberties. Maryland ratified on April 28, 1788; yeas
63, nays 11. South Carolina ratified on May 23, 1788; yeas 149, nays 73. On
June 21, 1788, by a vote of 57 to 46, New Hampshire became the ninth State
to ratify, but like Massachusetts she suggested a bill of rights.
     By the terms of the Constitution nine States were sufficient for its estab-
lishment among the States so ratifying. The advocates of the new Constitu-
tion realized, however, that the new Government could not succeed without
the addition of New York and Virginia, neither of which had ratified. Madi-
son, Marshall, and Randolph led the struggle for ratification in Virginia. On
June 25, 1788, by a narrow margin of 10 votes in a convention of 168 mem-
bers, that State ratified over the objection of such delegates as George Ma-
son and Patrick Henry. In New York an attempt to attach conditions to rati-
fication almost succeeded. But on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a
recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close—yeas
30, nays 27.
     Eleven States having thus ratified the Constitution,14 the Continental
Congress—which still functioned at irregular intervals—passed a resolution
on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into operation. The first
Wednesday of January 1789 was fixed as the day for choosing presidential
electors, the first Wednesday of February for the meeting of electors, and
the first Wednesday of March (i.e. March 4, 1789) for the opening session of
the new Congress. Owing to various delays, Congress was late in assem-
bling, and it was not until April 30, 1789, that George Washington was inau-
gurated as the first President of the United States.




    14 North Carolina added her ratification on November 21, 1789; yeas 184, nays 77. Rhode

Island did not ratify until May 29, 1790; yeas 34, nays 32.
