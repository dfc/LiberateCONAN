tricts, the Court indicated, would impose a task that few, if any,
judges are qualified to perform and one that would deprive the people
of control of their schools through elected representatives.1631 “The
constitutional right of the Negro respondents residing in Detroit is
to attend a unitary school system in that district.” 1632
     “The controlling principle consistently expounded in our hold-
ings,” the Court wrote in the Detroit case, “is that the scope of the
remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the constitu-
tional violation.” 1633 Although this axiom caused little problem when
the violation consisted of statutorily mandated separation,1634 it re-
quired a considerable expenditure of judicial effort and parsing of
opinions to work out in the context of systems in which the official
practice was nondiscriminatory, but official action operated to the
contrary. At first, the difficulty was obscured through the creation
of presumptions that eased the burden of proof on plaintiffs, but
later the Court appeared to stiffen the requirements on plaintiffs.
     Determination of the existence of a constitutional violation and
the formulation of remedies, within one district, first was pre-
sented to the Court in a northern setting in Keyes v. Denver School
District.1635 The lower courts had found the school segregation ex-
isting within one part of the city to be attributable to official ac-
tion, but as to the central city they found the separation not to be
the result of official action and refused to impose a remedy for those
     1631 418 U.S. at 742–43. This theme has been sounded in a number of cases in

suits seeking remedial actions in particularly intractable areas. Mayor of Philadel-
phia v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 615 (1974); O’Shea v. Littleton,
414 U.S. 488, 500–02 (1974). In Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 293 (1976), the
Court wrote that it had rejected the metropolitan order because of “fundamental
limitations on the remedial powers of the federal courts to restructure the operation
of local and state governmental entities . . . .” In other places, the Court stressed
the absence of interdistrict violations, id. at 294, and in still others paired the two
reasons. Id. at 296.
     1632 Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746 (1974). The four dissenters argued

both that state involvement was so pervasive that an inter-district order was permis-
sible and that such an order was mandated because it was the State’s obligation to
establish a unitary system, an obligation which could not be met without an inter-
district order. Id . at 757, 762, 781.
     1633 418 U.S. at 744. See Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 294 n.11 (1976) (“[T]he

Court’s decision in Milliken was premised on a controlling principle governing the
permissible scope of federal judicial power.”); Austin Indep. School Dist. v. United
States, 429 U.S. 990, 991 (1976) (Justice Powell concurring) (“a core principle of de-
segregation cases” is that set out in Milliken).
     1634 When an entire school system has been separated into white and black schools

by law, disestablishment of the system and integration of the entire system is re-
quired. “Having once found a violation, the district judge or school authorities should
make every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation,
taking into account the practicalities of the situation. . . . The measure of any de-
segregation plan is its effectiveness.” Davis v. Board of School Comm’rs, 402 U.S.
33, 37 (1971). See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 25 (1971).
     1635 413 U.S. 189 (1973).
