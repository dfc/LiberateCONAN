ing state.472 On the other hand, a fee collected only once as the price
of admission to do intrastate business is distinguishable from a tax
and accordingly may be levied on an out-of-state corporation based
on the amount of its authorized capital stock.473
    A municipal license tax imposed on a foreign corporation for goods
sold within and without the state, but manufactured in the city, is
not a tax on business transactions or property outside the city and
therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause.474 But a state
lacks jurisdiction to extend its privilege tax to the gross receipts of
a foreign contracting corporation for fabricating equipment outside
the taxing state, even if the equipment is later installed in the tax-
ing state. Unless the activities that are the subject of the tax are
carried on within its territorial limits, a state is not competent to
impose such a privilege tax.475
    Individual Income Taxes.—A state may tax annually the en-
tire net income of resident individuals from whatever source re-
ceived,476 as jurisdiction is founded upon the rights and privileges
incident to domicile. A state may also tax the portion of a nonresi-
dent’s net income that derives from property owned by him within
its borders, and from any business, trade, or profession carried on
by him within its borders.477 This state power is based upon the
state’s dominion over the property he owns, or over activity from
which the income derives, and from the obligation to contribute to
the support of a government that secures the collection of such in-
come. Accordingly, a state may tax residents on income from rents
of land located outside the state; from interest on bonds physically
outside the state and secured by mortgage upon lands physically
outside the state; 478 and from a trust created and administered in
another state and not directly taxable to the trustee.479 Further, the

portion of outstanding capital stock as is represented by property owned and used
in business transacted in the taxing state. St. Louis S.W. Ry. v. Arkansas, 235 U.S.
350 (1914).

    474 American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, 250 U.S. 459 (1919). Nor does a state license

tax on the production of electricity violate the due process clause because it may be
necessary, to ascertain, as an element in its computation, the amounts delivered in
another jurisdiction. Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, 286 U.S. 165 (1932). A tax on
chain stores, at a rate per store determined by the number of stores both within
and without the state is not unconstitutional as a tax in part upon things beyond
the jurisdiction of the state.
