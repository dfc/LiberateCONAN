     For instance, in Youngberg v. Romeo, the Court recognized a lib-
erty right to “minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure
safety and freedom from undue restraint.” 685 Although the lower
court had agreed that residents at a state mental hospital are en-
titled to “such treatment as will afford them a reasonable opportu-
nity to acquire and maintain those life skills necessary to cope as
effectively as their capacities permit,” 686 the Supreme Court found
that the plaintiff had reduced his claim to “training related to safety
and freedom from restraints.” 687 But the Court’s concern for feder-
alism, its reluctance to approve judicial activism in supervising in-
stitutions, and its recognition of the budgetary constraints associ-
ated with state provision of services caused it to hold that lower
federal courts must defer to professional decision-making to deter-
mine what level of care was adequate. Professional decisions are
presumptively valid and liability can be imposed “only when the
decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from
accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demon-
strate that the person responsible actually did not base the deci-
sion on such a judgment.” 688 Presumably, however, the difference
between liability for damages and injunctive relief will still afford
federal courts considerable latitude in enjoining institutions to bet-
ter their services in the future, even if they cannot award damages
for past failures.689
     The Court’s resolution of a case involving persistent sexual of-
fenders suggests that state civil commitment systems, besides con-
fining the dangerously mentally ill, may also act to incapacitate per-

    686  457 U.S. at 318 n.23.
     687 457 U.S. at 317–18. Concurring, Justices Blackmun, Brennan, and O’Connor,

argued that due process guaranteed patients at least that training necessary to pre-
vent them from losing the skills they entered the institution with. Id. at 325. Chief
Justice Burger rejected any protected interest in training. Id. at 329. The Court had
also avoided a decision on a right to treatment in O’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S.
563, 573 (1975), vacating and remanding a decision recognizing the right and thereby
depriving the decision of precedential value. Chief Justice Burger expressly rejected
the right there also. Id. at 578. But just four days later the Court denied certiorari
to another panel decision from the same circuit that had relied on the circuit’s Donaldson
decision to establish such a right, leaving the principle alive in that circuit. Burnham
v. Department of Public Health, 503 F.2d 1319 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S.
1057 (1975). See also Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 373 (1986) (dictum that person
civilly committed as “sexually dangerous person” might be entitled to protection un-
der the self-incrimination clause if he could show that his confinement “is essen-
tially identical to that imposed upon felons with no need for psychiatric care”).

     689 E.g., Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F. 2d 775, 779 (9th Cir. 1980); Welsch v. Likins,

550 F.2d 1122, 1132 (8th Cir. 1977). Of course, lack of funding will create problems
with respect to injunctive relief as well. Cf. New York State Ass’n for Retarded Chil-
dren v. Carey, 631 F.2d 162, 163 (2d Cir. 1980). The Supreme Court has limited the
injunctive powers of the federal courts in similar situations.
