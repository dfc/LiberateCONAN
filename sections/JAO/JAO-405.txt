the South that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, there
was no similar history of religious persecution constituting an “egre-
gious predicate” for the far-reaching provision of the Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act.2136
     A reinvigorated Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence has led to
a spate of decisions applying the principles the Court set forth in
Boerne, as litigants precluded from arguing that a state’s sovereign
immunity has been abrogated under Article I congressional pow-
ers 2137 seek alternative legislative authority in § 5. For instance,
in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Board v. College
Savings Bank,2138 a bank that had patented a financial method de-
signed to guarantee investors sufficient funds to cover the costs of
college tuition sued the State of Florida for administering a similar
program, arguing that the state’s sovereign immunity had been ab-
rogated by Congress in exercise of its Fourteenth Amendment en-
forcement power. The Court, however, held that application of the
federal patent law to the states was not properly tailored to rem-
edy or prevent due process violations. The Court noted that Con-
gress had identified no pattern of patent infringement by the states,
nor a systematic denial of state remedy for such violations such as
would constitute a deprivation of property without due process.2139
     A similar result was reached regarding the application of the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act to state agencies in Kimel
v. Florida Bd. of Regents.2140 In determining that the Act did not
meet the “congruence and proportionality” test, the Court focused
not just on whether state agencies had engaged in age discrimina-
tion, but on whether states had engaged in unconstitutional age dis-
     2136 Also, unlike the Voting Rights Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act

contained no geographic restrictions or termination dates. 521 U.S. at 532–33. The
Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was “so far out of propor-
tion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as
responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.” Id.
     2137 Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) (Article I powers

may not be used to abrogate a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity, but Fitzpatrick
v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), holding that Congress may abrogate Eleventh Amend-
ment immunity in exercise of Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power, remains
good law). See discussion pp. 1533–37.
     2138 527 U.S. 627 (1999).
     2139 527 U.S. at 639–46. See also College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Post-

secondary Educ. Expense Bd., , 527 U.S. 666 (1999) (Trademark Remedy Clarifica-
tion Act amendment to Lanham Act subjecting states to suits for false advertising is
not a valid exercise of Fourteenth Amendment power; neither the right to be free
from a business competitor’s false advertising nor a more generalized right to be
secure in one’s business interests qualifies as a “property” right protected by the
Due Process Clause).
     2140 528 U.S. 62 (2000). Again, the issue of the Congress’s power under § 5 of

the Fourteenth Amendment arose because sovereign immunity prevents private ac-
tions against states from being authorized under Article I powers such as the com-
merce clause.
