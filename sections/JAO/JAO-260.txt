reflected this. It has upheld economic classifications that suggested
impermissible intention to discriminate, reciting at length the Lindsley
standard, complete with the conceiving-of-a-basis and the one-step-
at-a-time rationale,1391 and it has applied this relaxed standard to
social welfare regulations.1392 In other cases, it has used the Royster
Guano standard and has looked to the actual goal articulated by
the legislature in determining whether the classification had a rea-
sonable relationship to that goal,1393 although it has usually ended
up upholding the classification. Finally, purportedly applying the ra-
tional basis test, the Court has invalidated some classifications in
the areas traditionally most subject to total deference.1394
    Attempts to develop a consistent principle have so far been un-
successful. In Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz,1395 the Court ac-
     1391 City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303–04 (1976); City of Pitts-

burgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 U.S. 369 (1974).
     1392 Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485–86 (1970); Jefferson v. Hackney,

406 U.S. 535, 549 (1972). See also New York City Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S.
568, 587–94 (1979).
     1393 E.g., McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270–77 (1973); Johnson v. Robison,

415 U.S. 361, 374–83 (1974); City of Charlotte v. International Ass’n of Firefighters,
426 U.S. 283, 286–89 (1976). It is significant that these opinions were written by
Justices who subsequently dissented from more relaxed standard of review cases
and urged adherence to at least a standard requiring articulation of the goals sought
to be achieved and an evaluation of the “fit” of the relationship between goal and
classification. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 182 (1980) (Justices
Brennan and Marshall dissenting); Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 239 (1981)
(Justices Powell, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens dissenting). See also New York
City Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 594 (1979) (Justice Powell concurring in
part and dissenting in part), and id. at 597, 602 (Justices White and Marshall dis-
senting).
     1394 E.g., Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74–79 (1972) (requirement for tenant

to post forfeitable bond for twice the amount of rent expected to accrue pending ap-
pellate decision on landlord-tenant dispute violates Equal Protection); Eisenstadt v.
Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (state cannot provide dissimilar access to contraceptives
for married and unmarried persons); James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128 (1972) (statute
allowing state to seek recoupment of attorney fees from indigent defendants who
were provided legal counsel may not treat defendants differently from other civil
debtors); Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528 (1973) (state may not
exclude households containing a person unrelated to other members of the house-
hold from food stamp program); City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473
U.S. 432 (1985) (rejecting various justifications offered for exclusion of a home for
the mentally retarded in an area where boarding homes, nursing and convalescent
homes, and fraternity or sorority houses were permitted). The Court in Reed v. Reed,
404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971), used the Royster Guano formulation and purported to strike
down a sex classification on the rational basis standard, but, whether the standard
was actually used or not, the case was the beginning of the decisions applying a
higher standard to sex classifications.
     1395 449 U.S. 166, 174–79 (1980). The quotation is at 176–77 n.10. The extent of

deference is notable, inasmuch as the legislative history seemed clearly to establish
that the purpose the Court purported to discern as the basis for the classification
was not the congressional purpose at all. Id. at 186–97 (Justice Brennan dissent-
ing). The Court observed, however, that it was “constitutionally irrelevant” whether
the plausible basis was in fact within Congress’s reasoning, inasmuch as the Court
