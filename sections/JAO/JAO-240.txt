then its existence is not subject to constitutional remedy.1279 Distin-
guishing between the two situations has occasioned much contro-
versy.
    For instance, in a case arising from a Denver, Colorado school
system in which no statutory dual system had ever been imposed,
the Court restated the obvious principle that de jure racial segrega-
tion caused by “intentionally segregative school board actions” is to
be treated as if it had been mandated by statute, and is to be dis-
tinguished from de facto segregation arising from actions not asso-
ciated with the state.1280 In addition, when it is proved that a mean-
ingful portion of a school system is segregated as a result of official
action, the responsible agency must then bear the burden of prov-
ing that other school segregation within the system is adventitious
and not the result of official action.1281 Moreover, the Court has also
apparently adopted a rule that if it can be proved that at some time
in the past a school board has purposefully maintained a racially
separated system, a continuing obligation to dismantle that system
can devolve upon the agency so that so that subsequent facially neu-
tral or ambiguous school board policies can form the basis for a ju-
dicial finding of intentional discrimination.1282
     Different results follow, however, when inter-district segrega-
tion is an issue. Disregard of district lines is permissible by a fed-
eral court in formulating a desegregation plan only when it finds
an inter-district violation. “Before the boundaries of separate and
autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the
separate units for remedial purposes by imposing a cross-district
remedy, it must first be shown that there has been a constitutional
violation within one district that produces a significant segregative
effect in another district. Specifically it must be shown that ra-
cially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of
a single school district, have been a substantive cause of inter-
