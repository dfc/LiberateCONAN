portunity for employment because he is not a member of a labor
union does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.1549 At a time
when protective labor legislation generally was falling under “lib-
erty of contract” applications of the Due Process Clause, the Court
generally approved protective legislation directed solely to women
workers,1550 and this solicitude continued into present times in the
approval of laws that were more questionable,1551 but passage of
the sex discrimination provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has
generally called into question all such protective legislation ad-
dressed solely to women.1552
     Monopolies and Unfair Trade Practices.—On the principle
that the law may hit the evil where it is most felt, state antitrust
laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals,1553 or to ven-
dors of commodities but not to vendors of labor,1554 have been up-
held. Contrary to its earlier view, the Court now holds that an an-
titrust act that exempts agricultural products in the hands of the
producer is valid.1555 Diversity with respect to penalties also has
been sustained. Corporations violating the law may be proceeded
against by bill in equity, while individuals are indicted and tried.1556
A provision, superimposed upon the general antitrust law, for revo-
cation of the licenses of fire insurance companies that enter into
illegal combinations, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.1557
A grant of monopoly privileges, if otherwise an appropriate exer-
cise of the police power, is immune to attack under that clause.1558
Likewise, enforcement of an unfair sales act, under which mer-
chants are privileged to give trading stamps, worth two and one-
half percent of the price, with goods sold at or near statutory cost,
while a competing merchant, not issuing stamps, is precluded from

(1949). Nor is it a denial of equal protection for a city to refuse to withhold from its
employees’ paychecks dues owing their union, although it withholds for taxes, retirement-
insurance programs, saving programs, and certain charities, because its offered jus-
tification that its practice of allowing withholding only when it benefits all city or
department employees is a legitimate method to avoid the burden of withholding
money for all persons or organizations that request a checkoff. City of Charlotte v.
