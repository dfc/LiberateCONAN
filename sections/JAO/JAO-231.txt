tary evidence. Presumptively, counsel should be provided where the
person requests counsel, based on a timely and colorable claim that
he has not committed the alleged violation, or if that issue be un-
contested, there are reasons in justification or mitigation that might
make revocation inappropriate.1236
     With respect to the granting of parole, the Court’s analysis of
the Due Process Clause’s meaning in Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal
Inmates 1237 is much more problematical. The theory was rejected
that the mere establishment of the possibility of parole was suffi-
cient to create a liberty interest entitling any prisoner meeting the
general standards of eligibility to a due process protected expecta-
tion of being dealt with in any particular way. On the other hand,
the Court did recognize that a parole statute could create an expec-
tancy of release entitled to some measure of constitutional protec-
tion, although a determination would need to be made on a case-by-
case basis,1238 and the full panoply of due process guarantees is not
required.1239 Where, however, government by its statutes and regu-
lations creates no obligation of the pardoning authority and thus
creates no legitimate expectancy of release, the prisoner may not
by showing the favorable exercise of the authority in the great num-
ber of cases demonstrate such a legitimate expectancy. The power
of the executive to pardon, or grant clemency, being a matter of grace,
is rarely subject to judicial review.1240

    1236  Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973).
    1237  442 U.S. 1 (1979). Justice Powell thought that creation of a parole system
did create a legitimate expectancy of fair procedure protected by due process, but,
save in one respect, he agreed with the Court that the procedure followed was ad-
equate. Id. at 18. Justices Marshall, Brennan, and Stevens argued in dissent that
the Court’s analysis of the liberty interest was faulty and that due process required
more than the board provided. Id. at 22.
     1238 Following Greenholtz, the Court held in Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S.

369 (1987), that a liberty interest was created by a Montana statute providing that
a prisoner “shall” be released upon certain findings by a parole board. Accord Swarthout
v. Cooke, 562 U.S. ___, 10–333, slip op. (2011) (per curiam).
     1239 The Court in Greenholtz held that procedures designed to elicit specific facts

were inappropriate under the circumstances, and minimizing the risk of error should
be the prime consideration. This goal may be achieved by the board’s largely infor-
mal methods; eschewing formal hearings, notice, and specification of particular evi-
dence in the record. The inmate in this case was afforded an opportunity to be heard
and when parole was denied he was informed in what respects he fell short of quali-
fying. That afforded the process that was due. Accord Swarthout v. Cooke, 562 U.S.
___, 10–333, slip op. (2011) (per curiam).
     1240 Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272 (1998). The mere exis-

tence of purely discretionary authority and the frequent exercise of it creates no
entitlement. Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458 (1981); Jago v.
Van Curen, 454 U.S. 14 (1981). The former case involved not parole but commuta-
tion of a life sentence, commutation being necessary to become eligible for parole.
The statute gave the Board total discretion to commute, but in at least 75% of the
cases prisoner received a favorable action and virtually all of the prisoners who had
