large to require justification but nonetheless be justifiable and le-
gally sustainable. It is now time to recognize . . . that minor devia-
tions from mathematical equality among state legislative districts
are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of invidious discrimi-
nation under the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require justifica-
tion by the State.” 1926 This recognition of a de minimis deviation,
below which no justification was necessary, was mandated, the Court
felt, by the margin of error in census statistics, by the population
change over the ten-year life of an apportionment, and by the relief
it afforded federal courts by enabling them to avoid over-
involvement in essentially a political process. The “goal of fair and
effective representation” is furthered by eliminating gross popula-
tion variations among districts, but it is not achieved by mathemati-
cal equality solely. Other relevant factors are to be taken into ac-
count.1927 But when a judicially imposed plan is to be formulated
upon state default, it “must ordinarily achieve the goal of popula-
tion equality with little more than de minimis variation,” and de-
viations from approximate population equality must be supported
by enunciation of historically significant state policy or unique fea-
tures.1928
     Gerrymandering and the permissible use of multimember dis-
tricts present examples of the third major issue. It is clear that ra-

ther consideration the rejection of a deviation in excess of 10% intended to preserve
political subdivision boundaries). In Brown v. Thomson, 462 U.S. 835 (1983), the Court
held that a consistent state policy assuring each county at least one representative
can justify substantial deviation from population equality when only the marginal
impact of representation for the state’s least populous county was challenged (the
effect on plaintiffs, voters in larger districts, was that they would elect 28 of 64 mem-
bers rather than 28 of 63), but there was indication in Justice O’Connor’s concur-
ring opinion that a broader-based challenge to the plan, which contained a 16% av-
erage deviation and an 89% maximum deviation, could have succeeded.
     1926 Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 745 (1973). The maximum deviation

was 7.83%. The Court did not precisely indicate at what point a deviation had to be
justified, but it applied the de minimis standard in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755
(1973), in which the maximum deviation was 9.9%. “Very likely, larger differences
between districts would not be tolerable without justification . . . .” Id. at 764. Jus-
tices Brennan, Douglas, and Marshall dissented. See also Brown v. Thomson, 462
U.S. 835, 842 (1983): “Our decisions have established, as a general matter, that an
apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation under 10% falls within
[the] category of minor deviations [insufficient to make out a prima facie case].”
     1927 Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 748 (1973). By contrast, the Court has

held that estimated margin of error for census statistics does not justify deviation
from population equality in congressional districting. Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S.
725 (1983).
     1928 Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975). The Court did say that court-

ordered reapportionment of a state legislature need not attain the mathematical pre-
ciseness required for congressional redistricting. Id. at 27 n.19. Apparently, there-
fore, the Court’s reference to both “de minimis” variations and “approximate population
equality” must be read as referring to some range approximating the Gaffney prin-
ciple. See also Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407 (1977).
