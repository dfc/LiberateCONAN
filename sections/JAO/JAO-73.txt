    Morality.—Legislatures have wide discretion in regulating “im-
moral” activities. Thus, legislation suppressing prostitution 370 or gam-
bling 371 will be upheld by the Court as within the police power of a
state. Accordingly, a state statute may provide that judgment against
a party to recover illegal gambling winnings may be enforced by a
lien on the property of the owner of the building where the gam-
bling transaction was conducted when the owner knowingly con-
sented to the gambling.372 Similarly, a court may order a car used
in an act of prostitution forfeited as a public nuisance, even if this
works a deprivation on an innocent joint owner of the car.373 For
the same reason, lotteries, including those operated under a legis-
lative grant, may be forbidden, regardless of any particular equi-
ties.374

Vested and Remedial Rights
    As the Due Process Clause protects against arbitrary depriva-
tion of “property,” privileges or benefits that constitute property are
entitled to protection.375 Because an existing right of action to re-
cover damages for an injury is property, that right of action is pro-
tected by the clause.376 Thus, where repeal of a provision that made
directors liable for moneys embezzled by corporate officers was ap-
plied retroactively, it deprived certain creditors of their property with-
out due process of law.377 A person, however, has no constitution-
ally protected property interest in any particular form of remedy
and is guaranteed only the preservation of a substantial right to
redress by an effective procedure.378
    Similarly, a statute creating an additional remedy for enforcing
liability does not, as applied to stockholders then holding stock, vio-

     375 See, e.g., Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1 (1944) (right to become a candidate

for state office is a privilege only, hence an unlawful denial of such right is not a
denial of a right of “property”). Cases under the equal protection clause now man-
date a different result. See Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 75
(1978) (seeming to conflate due process and equal protection standards in political
rights cases).

private industry nuclear accidents in order to encourage development of energy a
rational action, especially when combined with congressional pledge to take neces-
sary action in event of accident; whether limitation would have been of questionable
validity in absence of pledge uncertain but unlikely).
