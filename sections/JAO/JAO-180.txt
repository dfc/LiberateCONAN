the dispute involves a fundamental interest, such as marriage and
its dissolution, the state may not deny access to those persons un-
able to pay its fees.957
    Older cases, which have not been questioned by more recent ones,
held that a state, as the price of opening its tribunals to a nonresi-
dent plaintiff, may exact the condition that the nonresident stand
ready to answer all cross actions filed and accept any in personam
judgments obtained by a resident defendant through service of pro-
cess or appropriate pleading upon the plaintiff ’s attorney of re-
cord.958 For similar reasons, a requirement of the performance of a
chemical analysis as a condition precedent to a suit to recover for
damages resulting to crops from allegedly deficient fertilizers, while
allowing other evidence, was not deemed arbitrary or unreason-
able.959
    Amendment of pleadings is largely within the discretion of the
trial court, and unless a gross abuse of discretion is shown, there
is no ground for reversal. Accordingly, where the defense sought to
be interposed is without merit, a claim that due process would be
denied by rendition of a foreclosure decree without leave to file a
supplementary answer is utterly without foundation.960
     Defenses.—Just as a state may condition the right to institute
litigation, so may it establish terms for the interposition of certain
defenses. It may validly provide that one sued in a possessory ac-
tion cannot bring an action to try title until after judgment is ren-
dered and after he has paid that judgment.961 A state may limit
the defense in an action to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent to
the issue of payment and leave the tenants to other remedial ac-
tions at law on a claim that the landlord had failed to maintain
the premises.962 A state may also provide that the doctrines of con-
tributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow servant do not
bar recovery in certain employment-related accidents. No person has
