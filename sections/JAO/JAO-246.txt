ing was publicly built and owned, that the restaurant was an inte-
gral part of the complex, that the restaurant and the parking facilities
complemented each other, that the parking authority had regula-
tory power over the lessee, and that the financial success of the res-
taurant benefitted the governmental agency. The “degree of state
participation and involvement in discriminatory action,” therefore,
was sufficient to condemn it.1309
     The question arose, then, what degree of state participation was
“significant”? Would licensing of a business clothe the actions of that
business with sufficient state involvement? Would regulation? Or pro-
vision of police and fire protection? Would enforcement of state tres-
pass laws be invalid if it effectuated discrimination? The “sit-in” cases
of the early 1960s presented all these questions and more but did
not resolve them.1310 The basics of an answer came in Moose Lodge
No. 107 v. Irvis,1311 in which the Court held that the fact that a
private club was required to have a liquor license to serve alcoholic
drinks and did have such a license did not bar it from discriminat-
ing against African-Americans. It denied that private discrimina-
tion became constitutionally impermissible “if the private entity re-
ceives any sort of benefit or service at all from the State, or if it is
subject to state regulation in any degree whatever,” since any such
rule would eviscerate the state action doctrine. Rather, “where the
impetus for the discrimination is private, the State must have ‘sig-
nificantly involved itself with invidious discrimination.’ ” 1312 More-
over, although the state had extensive powers to regulate in detail
the liquor dealings of its licensees, “it cannot be said to in any way
foster or encourage racial discrimination. Nor can it be said to make
the State in any realistic sense a partner or even a joint venturer
in the club’s enterprise.” 1313 And there was nothing in the licens-
ing relationship here that approached “the symbiotic relationship
between lessor and lessee” that the Court had found in Burton.1314
     The Court subsequently made clear that governmental involve-
ment with private persons or private corporations is not the criti-
cal factor in determining the existence of “state action.” Rather, “the
inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between
the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that

constitutional. That provision required a licensee to observe all its by-laws and there-

laws. Id. at 177–79.
