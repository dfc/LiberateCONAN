are not judicial, yet they may satisfy the Due Process Clause.713
Moreover, the Due Process Clause does not require de novo judicial
review of the factual conclusions of state regulatory agencies,714 and
may not require judicial review at all.715 Nor does the Fourteenth
Amendment prohibit a state from conferring judicial functions upon
non-judicial bodies, or from delegating powers to a court that are
legislative in nature.716 Further, it is up to a state to determine to
what extent its legislative, executive, and judicial powers should be
kept distinct and separate.717
     The Requirements of Due Process.—Although due process tol-
erates variances in procedure “appropriate to the nature of the case,” 718
it is nonetheless possible to identify its core goals and require-
ments. First, “[p]rocedural due process rules are meant to protect
persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjus-
tified deprivation of life, liberty, or property.” 719 Thus, the required
elements of due process are those that “minimize substantively un-
fair or mistaken deprivations” by enabling persons to contest the
basis upon which a state proposes to deprive them of protected in-
terests.720 The core of these requirements is notice and a hearing
before an impartial tribunal. Due process may also require an op-
portunity for confrontation and cross-examination, and for discov-

     713 For instance, proceedings to raise revenue by levying and collecting taxes

are not necessarily judicial proceedings, yet their validity is not thereby impaired.

authority to appoint park commissioners and establish park districts, Ohio v. Akron
Park Dist., 281 U.S. 74, 79 (1930), are not in conflict with the Due Process Clause

     720 Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81 (1972). At times, the Court has also stressed

the dignitary importance of procedural rights, the worth of being able to defend one’s
interests even if one cannot change the result. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266–67
