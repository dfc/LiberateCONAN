representing interests in various parcels of land (some inside the
state and some outside), the holder of the certificates, though with-
out a voice in the management of the property, being entitled to a

    The Court also invalidated a property tax sought to be col-
lected from a life beneficiary on the corpus of a trust composed of
property located in another state and as to which the beneficiary
had neither control nor possession, apart from the receipt of in-
come therefrom.444 However, a personal property tax may be col-
lected on one-half of the value of the corpus of a trust from a resi-
dent who is one of the two trustees thereof, not withstanding that
the trust was created by the will of a resident of another state in
respect of intangible property located in the latter state, at least
where it does not appear that the trustee is exposed to the danger
of other ad valorem taxes in another state.445 The first case, Brooke
v. Norfolk,446 is distinguishable by virtue of the fact that the prop-
erty tax therein voided was levied upon a resident beneficiary rather
than upon a resident trustee in control of nonresident intangibles.
Also different is Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia,447 where a
property tax was unsuccessfully demanded of a nonresident trustee
with respect to nonresident intangibles under its control.
    A state in which a foreign corporation has acquired a commer-
cial domicile and in which it maintains its general business offices
may tax the corporation’s bank deposits and accounts receivable even
though the deposits are outside the state and the accounts receiv-
able arise from manufacturing activities in another state. Simi-
larly, a nondomiciliary state in which a foreign corporation did busi-
ness can tax the “corporate excess” arising from property employed
and business done in the taxing state.448 On the other hand, when
the foreign corporation transacts only interstate commerce within
a state, any excise tax on such excess is void, irrespective of the
amount of the tax.449
     Also a domiciliary state that imposes no franchise tax on a stock
fire insurance corporation may assess a tax on the full amount of

tion even though this “corporate excess” arose from property located and business
