Regulation of Businesses, Corporations, Professions, and
 Trades
    Generally.—States may impose significant regulations on busi-
nesses without violating due process. “The Constitution does not guar-
antee the unrestricted privilege to engage in a business or to con-
duct it as one pleases. Certain kinds of business may be prohibited;
and the right to conduct a business, or to pursue a calling, may be
conditioned. . . . Statutes prescribing the terms upon which those
conducting certain businesses may contract, or imposing terms if
they do enter into agreements, are within the State’s compe-
tency.” 221 Still, the fact that the state reserves the power to amend
or repeal corporate charters does not support the taking of corpo-
rate property without due process of law, as termination of the cor-
porate structure merely results in turning over corporate property
to the stockholders after liquidation.222
     Foreign (out-of-state) corporations also enjoy protection under
the Due Process Clauses, but this does not grant them an uncondi-
tional right to enter another state or to continue to do business in
it. Language in some early cases suggested that states had plenary
power to exclude or to expel a foreign corporation.223 This power is
clearly limited by the modern doctrine of the “negative” commerce
clause, which constrains states’ authority to discriminate against for-
eign corporations in favor of local commerce. Still, it has always
been acknowledged that states may subject corporate entry or con-
tinued operation to reasonable, non-discriminatory conditions. Thus,
for instance, a state law that requires the filing of articles with a
local official as a prerequisite to the validity of conveyances of local
realty to such corporations does not violate due process.224 In addi-
tion, statutes that require a foreign insurance company to main-
tain reserves computed by a specific percentage of premiums (includ-

fee was upheld. St. Louis, I. Mt. & So. Ry. v. Williams, 251 U.S. 63, 67 (1919). See
also Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Humes, 115 U.S. 512 (1885) (statute requiring railroads
to erect and maintain fences and cattle guards subject to award of double damages
for failure to so maintain them upheld); Minneapolis & St. L. Ry. v. Beckwith, 129
U.S. 26 (1889) (same); Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. v. Cram, 228 U.S. 70 (1913) (required
payment of $10 per car per hour to owner of livestock for failure to meet minimum
rate of speed for delivery upheld). But see Southwestern Tel. Co. v. Danaher, 238
U.S. 482 (1915) (fine of $3,600 imposed on a telephone company for suspending ser-
vice of patron in arrears in accordance with established and uncontested regula-
tions struck down as arbitrary and oppressive).

hicle Bd. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 106–08 (1978) (upholding regulation of
franchise relationship).
