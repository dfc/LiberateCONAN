eral courts,2080 and to provide criminal 2081 and civil 2082 liability for
state officials and agents 2083 or persons associated with them 2084
who violate protected rights. These statutory measures designed to
eliminate discrimination “under color of law” 2085 present no prob-
lems of constitutional foundation, although there may well be other
problems of application.2086 But the Reconstruction Congresses did
not stop with statutory implementation of rights guaranteed against
state infringement, moving as well against private interference.
     Thus, in the Civil Rights Act of 1875 2087 Congress had pro-
scribed private racial discrimination in the admission to and use of
inns, public conveyances, theaters, and other places of public amuse-
ment. The Civil Rights Cases 2088 found this enactment to be be-
yond Congress’s power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The
Court observed that § 1 prohibited only state action and did not reach
private conduct. Therefore, Congress’s power under § 5 to enforce
§ 1 by appropriate legislation was held to be similarly limited. “It
does not invest Congress with power to legislate upon subjects which
are within the domain of State legislation; but to provide modes of
relief against State legislation, or State action, of the kind referred
to. It does not authorize Congress to create a code of municipal law
for the regulation of private rights; but to provide modes of redress
against the operation of State laws, and the action of State officers
executive or judicial, when these are subversive of the fundamen-
     2080 Section 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, 28 U.S.C. § 1443. See

Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 318 (1880); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303
(1880). The statute is of limited utility because of the interpretation placed on it
almost from the beginning. Compare Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966), with
City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808 (1966).
     2081 18 U.S.C. §§ 241, 242. See Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91 (1945); Wil-

liams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97 (1951); United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745
(1966); United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 (1966); United States v. Johnson, 390
U.S. 563 (1968).
     2082 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961); see also 42 U.S.C.

§ 1985(3), construed in Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971).
     2083 Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880).
     2084 United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 (1966).
     2085 Both 18 U.S.C. § 242 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 contain language restricting ap-

plication to deprivations under color of state law, whereas 18 U.S.C. § 241 lacks such
language. The newest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 245, contains, of course, no such lan-
guage. On the meaning of “custom” as used in the “under color of ” phrase, see Adickes
v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144 (1970).
     2086 E.g., the problem of “specific intent” in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91

(1945), and Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97 (1951), and the problem of what
“right or privilege” is “secured” to a person by the Constitution and laws of the United
States, which divided the Court in United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70 (1951),
and which was resolved in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 (1966).
     2087 18 Stat. 335, §§ 1, 2.
     2088 109 U.S. 3 (1883). The Court also rejected the Thirteenth Amendment foun-

dation for the statute, a foundation revived by Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392
U.S. 409 (1968).
