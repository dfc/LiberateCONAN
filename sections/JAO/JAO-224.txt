“all,” and it was clear that the Due Process and Equal Protection
Clauses to some extent do apply to prisoners.1195 More direct ac-
knowledgment of constitutional protection came in 1972: “[f]ederal
courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional
rights of all ‘persons,’ which include prisoners. We are not unmind-
ful that prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administra-
tion of prison affairs, and that prisoners necessarily are subject to
appropriate rules and regulations. But persons in prison, like other
individuals, have the right to petition the government for redress
of grievances . . . .” 1196 However, while the Court affirmed that fed-
eral courts have the responsibility to scrutinize prison practices al-
leged to violate the Constitution, at the same time concerns of fed-
eralism and of judicial restraint caused the Court to emphasize the
necessity of deference to the judgments of prison officials and oth-
ers with responsibility for administering such systems.1197
     Save for challenges to conditions of confinement of pretrial de-
tainees,1198 the Court has generally treated challenges to prison con-
ditions as a whole under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause
of the Eighth Amendment,1199 while challenges to particular inci-
dents and practices are pursued under the Due Process Clause 1200
or more specific provisions, such as the First Amendment’s speech
and religion clauses.1201 Prior to formulating its current approach,
the Court recognized several rights of prisoners. Prisoners have the
right to petition for redress of grievances, which includes access to

of this country.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555–56 (1974).
     1196 Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972). See also Procunier v. Martinez, 416

U.S. 396, 404–05 (1974) (invalidating state prison mail censorship regulations).
     1197 Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545–548, 551, 555, 562 (1979) (federal prison);

Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 351–352 (1981).
     1198 Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). Persons not yet convicted of a crime

may be detained by government upon the appropriate determination of probable cause
and the detention may be effectuated through subjection of the prisoner to the re-
strictions and conditions of the detention facility. But a detainee may not be pun-
ished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law. There-
fore, unconvicted detainees may not be subjected to conditions and restrictions that
amount to punishment. However, the Court limited its concept of punishment to prac-
tices intentionally inflicted by prison authorities and to practices which were arbi-
trary or purposeless and unrelated to legitimate institutional objectives.
