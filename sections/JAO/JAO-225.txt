the courts for purposes of presenting their complaints,1202 and to
bring actions in federal courts to recover for damages wrongfully
done them by prison administrators.1203 And they have a right, cir-
cumscribed by legitimate prison administration considerations, to
fair and regular treatment during their incarceration. Prisoners have
a right to be free of racial segregation in prisons, except for the
necessities of prison security and discipline.1204
     In Turner v. Safley,1205 the Court announced a general stan-
dard for measuring prisoners’ claims of deprivation of constitu-
tional rights: “[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ con-
stitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related
to legitimate penological interests.” 1206 Several considerations, the
Court indicated, are appropriate in determining reasonableness of
a prison regulation. First, there must be a rational relation to a
legitimate, content-neutral objective, such as prison security, broadly
defined. Availability of other avenues for exercise of the inmate right
suggests reasonableness.1207 A further indicium of reasonableness
is present if accommodation would have a negative effect on the
liberty or safety of guards, other inmates,1208 or visitors.1209 On the
other hand, “if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that

Prisoners must have reasonable access to a law library or to persons trained in the
law. Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15 (1971); Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1978).
Establishing a right of access to law materials, however, requires an individualized
demonstration of an inmate having been hindered in efforts to pursue a legal claim.
See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996) (no requirement that the state “enable [a]
prisoner to discover grievances, and to litigate effectively”).

(1973).
     1204 Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S. 333 (1968). There was some question as to the

standard to be applied to racial discrimination in prisons after Turner v. Safley, 482
U.S. 78 (1987) (prison regulations upheld if “reasonably related to legitimate peno-
logical interests”). In Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), however, the Court
held that discriminatory prison regulations would continue to be evaluated under a
“strict scrutiny” standard, which requires that regulations be narrowly tailored to
further compelling governmental interests. Id. at 509–13 (striking down a require-
ment that new or transferred prisoners at the reception area of a correctional facil-
ity be assigned a cellmate of the same race for up to 60 days before they are given a
regular housing assignment).

spondence, but striking down a prohibition on inmate marriages absent compelling
reason such as pregnancy or birth of a child). See Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126
(2003) (upholding restrictions on prison visitation by unrelated children or children
over which a prisoner’s parental rights have been terminated and visitation where
a prisoner has violated rules against substance abuse).

of prisoners to communicate through other visitors, by letter, or by phone. 539 U.S.
