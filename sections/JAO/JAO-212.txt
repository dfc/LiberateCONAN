greater part of marijuana consumed in the United States is of for-
eign origin, there was still a good amount produced domestically
and there was no way to assure that the majority of those possess-
ing marijuana have any reason to know whether their marijuana
is imported.1128 The Court left open the question whether a presump-
tion that survived the “rational connection” test “must also satisfy
the criminal ‘reasonable doubt’ standard if proof of the crime charged
or an essential element thereof depends upon its use.” 1129
    In a later case, a closely divided Court drew a distinction be-
tween mandatory presumptions, which a jury must accept, and per-
missive presumptions, which may be presented to the jury as part
of all the evidence to be considered. With respect to mandatory pre-
sumptions, “since the prosecution bears the burden of establishing
guilt, it may not rest its case entirely on a presumption, unless the
fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.” 1130 But, with respect to permissive presump-
tions, “the prosecution may rely on all of the evidence in the record
to meet the reasonable doubt standard. There is no more reason to
require a permissive statutory presumption to meet a reasonable-
doubt standard before it may be permitted to play any part in a
trial than there is to require that degree of probative force for other
relevant evidence before it may be admitted. As long as it is clear
that the presumption is not the sole and sufficient basis for a find-
ing of guilt, it need only satisfy the test described in Leary.” 1131
Thus, due process was not violated by the application of the stat-
ute that provides that “the presence of a firearm in an automobile
is presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all persons then
occupying the vehicle.” 1132 The division of the Court in these cases

     1128 395 U.S. at 37–54. Although some of the reasoning in Yee Hem, supra, was

disapproved, it was factually distinguished as involving users of “hard” narcotics.
     1129 395 U.S. at 36 n.64. The matter was also left open in Turner v. United States,

396 U.S. 398 (1970) (judged by either “rational connection” or “reasonable doubt,” a
presumption that the possessor of heroin knew it was illegally imported was valid,
but the same presumption with regard to cocaine was invalid under the “rational
connection” test because a great deal of the substance was produced domestically),
and in Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837 (1973) (under either test a presump-
tion that possession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, is grounds
for inferring possessor knew it was stolen satisfies due process).
     1130 Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 167 (1979).
     1131 442 U.S. at 167.
     1132 442 U.S. at 142. The majority thought that possession was more likely than

not the case from the circumstances, while the four dissenters disagreed. 442 U.S.
at 168. See also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62 (1991) (upholding a jury instruction
that, to dissenting Justices O’Connor and Stevens, id. at 75, seemed to direct the
jury to draw the inference that evidence that a child had been “battered” in the
past meant that the defendant, the child’s father, had necessarily done the batter-
ing).
