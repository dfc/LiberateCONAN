the arbitrary exercise of government power.707 Exactly what proce-
dures are needed to satisfy due process, however, will vary depend-
ing on the circumstances and subject matter involved.708 One of the
basic criteria used to establish whether due process is satisfied is
whether such procedure was historically required in like circum-
stances.
     Relevance of Historical Use.—The requirements of due pro-
cess are determined in part by an examination of the settled us-
ages and modes of proceedings of the common and statutory law of
England during pre-colonial times and in the early years of this coun-
try.709 In other words, the antiquity of a legal procedure is a factor
weighing in its favor. However, it does not follow that a procedure
settled in English law and adopted in this country is, or remains,
an essential element of due process of law. If that were so, the pro-
cedure of the first half of the seventeenth century would be “fas-
tened upon American jurisprudence like a strait jacket, only to be
unloosed by constitutional amendment.” 710 Fortunately, the states
are not tied down by any provision of the Constitution to the prac-
tice and procedure that existed at the common law, but may avail
themselves of the wisdom gathered by the experience of the coun-
try to make changes deemed to be necessary.711
    Non-Judicial Proceedings.—A court proceeding is not a req-
uisite of due process.712 Administrative and executive proceedings

     707 Thus, where a litigant had the benefit of a full and fair trial in the state

courts, and his rights are measured, not by laws made to affect him individually,
but by general provisions of law applicable to all those in like condition, he is not
deprived of property without due process of law, even if he can be regarded as de-
prived of his property by an adverse result. Marchant v. Pennsylvania R.R., 153 U.S.
380, 386 (1894).
     708 Hagar v. Reclamation Dist., 111 U.S. 701, 708 (1884). “Due process of law is

[process which], following the forms of law, is appropriate to the case and just to
the parties affected. It must be pursued in the ordinary mode prescribed by law; it
must be adapted to the end to be attained; and whenever necessary to the protec-
tion of the parties, it must give them an opportunity to be heard respecting the jus-
tice of the judgment sought. Any legal proceeding enforced by public authority, whether
sanctioned by age or custom or newly devised in the discretion of the legislative
power, which regards and preserves these principles of liberty and justice, must be
held to be due process of law.” Id. at 708; Accord, Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S.
516, 537 (1884).
     709 Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 101 (1908); Brown v. New Jersey, 175

U.S. 172, 175 (1899). “A process of law, which is not otherwise forbidden, must be
taken to be due process of law, if it can show the sanction of settled usage both in
England and this country.” Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. at 529.
     710 Twining, 211 U.S. at 101.
