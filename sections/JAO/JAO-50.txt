tion.206 Likewise, requiring a railway to continue the service of a
branch or part of a line is acceptable, even if that portion of the
operation is an economic drain.207 A company, however, cannot be
compelled to operate its franchise at a loss, but must be at liberty
to surrender it and discontinue operations.208
    As the standard for regulation of a utility is whether a particu-
lar directive is reasonable, the question of whether a state order
requiring the provision of services is reasonable could include a con-
sideration of the likelihood of pecuniary loss, the nature, extent and
productiveness of the carrier’s intrastate business, the character of
the service required, the public need for it, and its effect upon ser-
vice already being rendered.209 An example of the kind of regula-
tion where the issue of reasonableness would require an evaluation
of numerous practical and economic factors is one that requires rail-
roads to lay tracks and otherwise provide the required equipment
to facilitate the connection of separate track lines.210

     210 “Since the decision in Wisconsin, M. & P.R. Co. v. Jacobson, 179 U.S. 287

(1900), there can be no doubt of the power of a state, acting through an administra-
tive body, to require railroad companies to make track connections. But manifestly
that does not mean that a Commission may compel them to build branch lines, so
as to connect roads lying at a distance from each other; nor does it mean that they
may be required to make connections at every point where their tracks come close
together in city, town and country, regardless of the amount of business to be done,
or the number of persons who may use the connection if built. The question in each
case must be determined in the light of all the facts and with a just regard to the
advantage to be derived by the public and the expense to be incurred by the car-
rier. . . . If the order involves the use of property needed in the discharge of those
duties which the carrier is bound to perform, then, upon proof of the necessity, the
order will be granted, even though ‘the furnishing of such necessary facilities may
occasion an incidental pecuniary loss.’ . . . Where, however, the proceeding is brought
to compel a carrier to furnish a facility not included within its absolute duties, the
question of expense is of more controlling importance. In determining the reasonable-
ness of such an order the Court must consider all the facts—the places and persons
interested, the volume of business to be affected, the saving in time and expense to
the shipper, as against the cost and loss to the carrier.” Washington ex rel. Oregon
