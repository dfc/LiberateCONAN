mental to the definition and government of a State.” 1783 Thus, “gov-
ernmental entities, when exercising the functions of government,
have wider latitude in limiting the participation of nonciti-
zens.” 1784 Teachers, the Court thought, because of the role of public
education in inculcating civic values and in preparing children for
participation in society as citizens and because of the responsibility
and discretion they have in fulfilling that role, perform a task that
“go[es] to the heart of representative government.” 1785 The citizen-
ship requirement need only bear a rational relationship to the state
interest, and the Court concluded it clearly did so.
     Then, in Cabell v. Chavez-Salido,1786 the Court, by a 5-to-4 vote,
sustained a state law imposing a citizenship requirement upon all
positions designated as “peace officers,” upholding in context that
eligibility prerequisite for probation officers. First, the Court held
that the extension of the requirement to an enormous range of people
who were variously classified as “peace officers” did not reach so
far nor was it so broad and haphazard as to belie the claim that
the state was attempting to ensure that an important function of
government be in the hands of those having a bond of citizenship.
“[T]he classifications used need not be precise; there need only be a
substantial fit.” 1787 As to the particular positions, the Court held
that “they, like the state troopers involved in Foley, sufficiently par-
take of the sovereign’s power to exercise coercive force over the in-
dividual that they may be limited to citizens.” 1788
     Thus, the Court so far has drawn a tripartite differentiation with
respect to governmental restrictions on aliens. First, it has disap-
proved the earlier line of cases and now would foreclose attempts
by the states to retain certain economic benefits, primarily employ-
ment and opportunities for livelihood, exclusively for citizens. Sec-
ond, when government exercises principally its spending functions,
such as those with respect to public employment generally and to
eligibility for public benefits, its classifications with an adverse im-
pact on aliens will be strictly scrutinized and usually fail. Third,
when government acts in its sovereign capacity—when it acts within
its constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities to establish and
operate its own government—its decisions with respect to the citi-
zenship qualifications of an appropriately designated class of pub-
lic office holders will be subject only to traditional rational basis
