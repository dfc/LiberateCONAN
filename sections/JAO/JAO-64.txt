the extent of present use or speculation as to future needs. . . . What
it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will.” 301 This
holding has since been disapproved, but on interstate commerce rather
than due process grounds.302 States may, however, enact and en-
force a variety of conservation measures for the protection of water-
sheds.303
    Similarly, a state has sufficient control over fish and wild game
found within its boundaries 304 so that it may regulate or prohibit
fishing and hunting.305 For the effective enforcement of such restric-
tions, a state may also forbid the possession within its borders of
special instruments of violations, such as nets, traps, and seines,
regardless of the time of acquisition or the protestations of lawful
intentions on the part of a particular possessor.306 The Court has
also upheld a state law restricting a commercial reduction plant from
accepting more fish than it could process without spoilage in order
to conserve fish found within its waters, even allowing the applica-
tion of such restriction to fish imported into the state from adja-
cent international waters.307
    The Court’s early decisions rested on the legal fiction that the
states owned the fish and wild game within their borders, and thus
could reserve these possessions for use by their own citizens.308 The
Court soon backed away from the ownership fiction,309 and in Hughes
v. Oklahoma 310 it formally overruled prior case law, indicating that
state conservation measures discriminating against out-of-state per-
sons were to be measured under the Commerce Clause. Although a
state’s “concerns for conservation and protection of wild animals”
