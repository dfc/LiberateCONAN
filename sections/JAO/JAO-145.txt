ing in the public university’s contract, regulations, or policies that
“created any legitimate claim” to reemployment.774 By contrast, in
Perry v. Sindermann,775 a professor employed for several years at a
public college was found to have a protected interest, even though
his employment contract had no tenure provision and there was no
statutory assurance of it.776 The “existing rules or understandings”
were deemed to have the characteristics of tenure, and thus pro-
vided a legitimate expectation independent of any contract provi-
sion.777
    The Court has also found “legitimate entitlements” in a variety
of other situations besides employment. In Goss v. Lopez,778 an Ohio
statute provided for both free education to all residents between five
and 21 years of age and compulsory school attendance; thus, the
state was deemed to have obligated itself to accord students some
due process hearing rights prior to suspending them, even for such
a short period as ten days. “Having chosen to extend the right to
an education to people of appellees’ class generally, Ohio may not
withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct, absent fundamen-
tally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has oc-

      774 436 U.S. at 576–78. The Court also held that no liberty interest was impli-

cated, because in declining to rehire Roth the state had not made any charges against
him or taken any actions that would damage his reputation or stigmatize him. 436
at 572–75. For an instance of protection accorded a claimant on the basis of such an
action, see Codd v. Vegler. See also Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 347–50 (1976);
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491–94 (1980); Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S.
78, 82–84 (1978).
      775 408 U.S. 593 (1972). See Leis v. Flynt, 439 U.S. 438 (1979) (finding no prac-

tice or mutually explicit understanding creating interest).
      776 408 U.S. at 601–03 (1972). In contrast, a statutory assurance was found in

Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), where the civil service laws and regula-
tions allowed suspension or termination “only for such cause as would promote the
efficiency of the service.” 416 U.S. at 140. On the other hand, a policeman who was
a “permanent employee” under an ordinance which appeared to afford him a continu-
ing position subject to conditions subsequent was held not to be protected by the
Due Process Clause because the federal district court interpreted the ordinance as
providing only employment at the will and pleasure of the city, an interpretation
that the Supreme Court chose not to disturb. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341 (1976).
“On its face,” the Court noted, “the ordinance on which [claimant relied] may fairly
be read as conferring” both “a property interest in employment . . . [and] an enforce-
able expectation of continued public employment.” 426 U.S. at 344–45 (1976). The
district court’s decision had been affirmed by an equally divided appeals court and
the Supreme Court deferred to the presumed greater expertise of the lower court
judges in reading the ordinance. 426 U.S. at 345 (1976).
      777 408 U.S. at 601.
      778 419 U.S. 565 (1975). Cf. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978) (measure of

damages for violation of procedural due process in school suspension context). See
also Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78 (1978) (whether liberty or property
interest implicated in academic dismissals and discipline, as contrasted to disciplin-
ary actions).
