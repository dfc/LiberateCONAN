Housing
    Buchanan v. Warley 1688 invalidated an ordinance that prohib-
ited blacks from occupying houses in blocks where the greater num-
ber of houses were occupied by whites and that prohibited whites
from doing so where the greater number of houses were occupied
by blacks. Although racially restrictive covenants do not them-
selves violate the Equal Protection Clause, the judicial enforce-
ment of them, either by injunctive relief or through entertaining
damage actions, does.1689 Referendum passage of a constitutional
amendment repealing a “fair housing” law and prohibiting further
state or local action in that direction was held unconstitutional in
Reitman v. Mulkey,1690 though on somewhat ambiguous grounds,
whereas a state constitutional requirement that decisions of local
authorities to build low-rent housing projects in an area must first
be submitted to referendum, although other similar decisions were
not so limited, was found not to violate the Equal Protection Clause.1691
Private racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing is sub-
ject to two federal laws prohibiting most such discrimination.1692
Provision of publicly assisted housing, of course, must be on a non-
discriminatory basis.1693

Other Areas of Discrimination

preme Court endorsement in the transportation context,1694 and its
passing in the education field did not long predate its demise in
transportation as well.1695 During the interval, the Court held in-
valid a state statute that permitted carriers to provide sleeping and
dining cars for white persons only,1696 held that a carrier’s provi-
