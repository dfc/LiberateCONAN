was substituted for the word “citizen” with a view to protecting cor-
porations from oppressive state legislation.41 As early as the 1877
Granger Cases 42 the Supreme Court upheld various regulatory state
laws without raising any question as to whether a corporation could
advance due process claims. Further, there is no doubt that a cor-
poration may not be deprived of its property without due process of
law.43 Although various decisions have held that the “liberty” guar-
anteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is the liberty of natural,44
not artificial, persons,45 nevertheless, in 1936, a newspaper corpo-
ration successfully objected that a state law deprived it of liberty
of the press.46
    A separate question is the ability of a government official to in-
voke the Due Process Clause to protect the interests of his office.
Ordinarily, the mere official interest of a public officer, such as the
interest in enforcing a law, has not been deemed adequate to en-
able him to challenge the constitutionality of a law under the Four-
teenth Amendment.47 Similarly, municipal corporations have no stand-
ing “to invoke the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment in

     42 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1877). In a case arising under the Fifth Amend-

ment, decided almost at the same time, the Court explicitly declared the United States
“equally with the States . . . are prohibited from depriving persons or corporations
of property without due process of law.” Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U.S. 700, 718–19

all human beings regardless of race, color, or citizenship. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118

362 (1904), a case interpreting the federal antitrust law, Justice Brewer, in a concur-
ring opinion, had declared that “a corporation . . . is not endowed with the inalien-
able rights of a natural person.”

In First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), faced with the valid-
ity of state restraints upon expression by corporations, the Court did not determine
that corporations have First Amendment liberty rights—and other constitutional rights—
but decided instead that expression was protected, irrespective of the speaker, be-
cause of the interests of the listeners. See id. at 778 n.14 (reserving question). But
see id. at 809, 822 (Justices White and Rehnquist dissenting) (corporations as crea-
tures of the state have the rights state gives them).
