tions of the same kind,” 1485 and that where it has acquired property
of a fixed and permanent nature in a state, it cannot be subjected
to a more onerous tax for the privilege of doing business than is
imposed on domestic corporations.1486 A state statute taxing for-
eign corporations writing fire, marine, inland navigation and casu-
alty insurance on net receipts, including receipts from casualty busi-
ness, was held invalid under the Equal Protection Clause where foreign
companies writing only casualty insurance were not subject to a simi-
lar tax.1487 Later, the doctrine of Philadelphia Fire Association v.
New York was revived to sustain an increased tax on gross premi-
ums which was exacted as an annual license fee from foreign but
not from domestic corporations.1488 Even though the right of a for-
eign corporation to do business in a state rests on a license, the
Equal Protection Clause is held to insure it equality of treatment,
at least so far as ad valorem taxation is concerned.1489 The Court,
in WHYY Inc. v. Glassboro,1490 held that a foreign nonprofit corpo-
ration licensed to do business in the taxing state is denied equal
protection of the law where an exemption from state property taxes
granted to domestic corporations is denied to a foreign corporation
solely because it was organized under the laws of a sister state and
where there is no greater administrative burden in evaluating a for-
eign corporation than a domestic corporation in the taxing state.
    State taxation of insurance companies, insulated from Com-
merce Clause attack by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, must pass simi-
lar hurdles under the Equal Protection Clause. In Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co. v. Ward,1491 the Court concluded that taxation favoring do-
mestic over foreign corporations “constitutes the very sort of paro-
chial discrimination that the Equal Protection Clause was in-
tended to prevent.” Rejecting the assertion that it was merely imposing
“Commerce Clause rhetoric in equal protection clothing,” the Court
explained that the emphasis is different even though the result in
some cases will be the same: the Commerce Clause measures the
effects which otherwise valid state enactments have on interstate

     1488 Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 325 U.S. 673 (1945). This decision was

described as “an anachronism” in Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. Of
Equalization, 451 U.S. 648, 667 (1981), the Court reaffirming the rule that taxes
discriminating against foreign corporations must bear a rational relation to a legiti-
mate state purpose.

for the Court joined by Chief Justice Burger and by Justices White, Blackmun, and
Stevens. Justice O’Connor’s dissent was joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and
Rehnquist.
