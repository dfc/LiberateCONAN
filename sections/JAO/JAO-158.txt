    The Court has required greater protection from property depri-
vations resulting from operation of established state procedures than
from those resulting from random and unauthorized acts of state
employees,840 and presumably this distinction still holds. Thus, the
Court has held that post-deprivation procedures would not satisfy
due process if it is “the state system itself that destroys a complain-
ant’s property interest.” 841 Although the Court briefly entertained
the theory that a negligent (i.e., non-willful) action by a state offi-
cial was sufficient to invoke due process, and that a post-
deprivation hearing regarding such loss was required,842 the Court
subsequently overruled this holding, stating that “the Due Process
Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official caus-
ing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.” 843
    In “rare and extraordinary situations,” where summary action
is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the public, and the pri-
vate interest infringed is reasonably deemed to be of less impor-
tance, government can take action with no notice and no opportu-
nity to defend, subject to a later full hearing.844 Examples are seizure

     840 Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. at 435–36 (1982). The Court em-

phasized that a post-deprivation hearing regarding harm inflicted by a state proce-
dure would be inadequate. “That is particularly true where, as here, the State’s only
post-termination process comes in the form of an independent tort action. Seeking
redress through a tort suit is apt to be a lengthy and speculative process, which in
a situation such as this one will never make the complainant entirely whole.” 455
U.S. 422, 436–37.
     841 455 U.S. at 436.
     842 More expressly adopting the tort remedy theory, the Court in Parratt v. Tay-

lor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981), held that the loss of a prisoner’s mail-ordered goods through
the negligence of prison officials constituted a deprivation of property, but that the
state’s post-deprivation tort-claims procedure afforded adequate due process. When
a state officer or employee acts negligently, the Court recognized, there is no way
that the state can provide a pre-termination hearing; the real question, therefore, is
what kind of post-deprivation hearing is sufficient. When the action complained of
is the result of the unauthorized failure of agents to follow established procedures
and there is no contention that the procedures themselves are inadequate, the Due
Process Clause is satisfied by the provision of a judicial remedy which the claimant
must initiate. 451 U.S. at 541, 543–44. It should be noted that Parratt was a prop-
erty loss case, and thus may be distinguished from liberty cases, where a tort rem-
edy, by itself, may not be adequate process. See Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. at
680–82.
     843 Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986) (involving negligent acts by

prison officials). Hence, there is no requirement for procedural due process stem-
ming from such negligent acts and no resulting basis for suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983
for deprivation of rights deriving from the Constitution. Prisoners may resort to state
tort law in such circumstances, but neither the Constitution nor § 1983 provides a
federal remedy.
     844 Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 570 n.7 (1972); Bell v. Burson, 402

U.S. 535, 542 (1971). See Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 538–40 (1981). Of course,
one may waive his due process rights, though as with other constitutional rights,
the waiver must be knowing and voluntary. D.H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405
U.S. 174 (1972). See also Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 94–96 (1972).
