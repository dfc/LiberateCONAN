the Constitution.2122
    Congress’s power under Morgan returned to the Court’s consid-
eration when several states challenged congressional legisla-
tion 2123 lowering the voting age in all elections to 18 and prescrib-
ing residency and absentee voting requirements for the conduct of
presidential elections. In upholding the latter provision and in di-
viding over the former, the Court revealed that Morgan’s vitality
was in some considerable doubt, at least with regard to the reach
that many observers had previously seen.2124 Four Justices ac-
cepted Morgan in full,2125 while one Justice rejected it totally 2126
and another would have limited it to racial cases.2127
    The other three Justices seemingly restricted Morgan to an al-
ternate rationale found in that case. In Morgan, in addition to the
theory that Congress has special competience to adudge discrimina-
tion, Justice Brennan had asserted that Congress may override state
law not because the law itself violated the Equal Protection Clause
but because being without the vote meant a class of persons were
being subjected to discriminatory state and local treatment. Giving
these people the ballot would afford a means of correcting that situ-
ation, making the statute an appropriate means to enforce the Equal
Protection Clause under “necessary and proper” standards.2128 This
rationale served as the basis for upholding the age reduction provi-
sion, while the manner in which these Justices dealt with the resi-
dency and absentee voting provision was to afford Congress some
degree of discretion in making substantive decisions about what state
action is discriminatory above and beyond the judicial view of the
matter.2129
