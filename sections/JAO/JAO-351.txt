tion condemns.” 1858 The Constitution provides that the qualifications
of electors in congressional elections are to be determined by refer-
ence to the qualifications prescribed in the states for the electors of
the most numerous branch of the legislature, and the states are
authorized to determine the manner in which presidential electors
are selected.1859 The second section of the Fourteenth Amendment
provides for a proportionate reduction in a state’s representation in
the House when it denies the franchise to its qualified male citi-
zens 1860 and specific discriminations on the basis of race, sex, and
age are addressed in other Amendments. “We do not suggest that
any standards which a State desires to adopt may be required of
voters. But there is wide scope for exercise of its jurisdiction. Resi-
dence requirements, age, previous criminal record . . . are obvious
examples indicating factors which a state may take into consider-
ation in determining the qualification of voters. The ability to read
and write likewise has some relation to standards designed to pro-
mote intelligent use of the ballot.” 1861
    The perspective of this 1959 opinion by Justice Douglas has now
been revolutionized. “Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a funda-
mental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the
right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is
preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged in-
fringement of the rights of citizens to vote must be carefully and
meticulously scrutinized.” 1862 “Any unjustified discrimination in de-

government. . . . Statutes granting the franchise to residents on a
selective basis always pose the danger of denying some citizens any
effective voice in the governmental affairs which substantially af-

right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citi-

provision impliedly permitted the states to discriminate with only the prescribed pen-
alty in consequence and that therefore the equal protection clause was wholly inap-
plicable to state election laws. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 589 (1964) (dissent-

senting). But see Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), where § 2 was relevant
