opposition to the will of their creator,” the state.48 However, state
officers are acknowledged to have an interest, despite their not hav-
ing sustained any “private damage,” in resisting an “endeavor to
prevent the enforcement of statutes in relation to which they have
official duties,” and, accordingly, may apply to federal courts “to re-
view decisions of state courts declaring state statutes, which [they]
seek to enforce, to be repugnant to the [Fourteenth Amendment of]
the Federal Constitution . . . .” 49
     “Property” and Police Power.—States have an inherent “po-
lice power” to promote public safety, health, morals, public conve-
nience, and general prosperity,50 but the extent of the power may
vary based on the subject matter over which it is exercised.51 If a
police power regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a tak-

v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182 (1923); Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, 289 U.S. 36
(1933). But see Madison School Dist. v. WERC, 429 U.S. 167, 175 n.7 (1976) (reserv-

right assertable against a state).

Gas Co., 291 U.S. 656 (1934); South Carolina Highway Dep’t v. Barnwell Bros., 303
U.S. 177 (1938). The converse is not true, however, and the interest of a state offi-
cial in vindicating the Constitution gives him no legal standing to attack the consti-
tutionality of a state statute in order to avoid compliance with it. Smith v. Indiana,
191 U.S. 138 (1903); Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U.S. 192 (1908);
Marshall v. Dye, 231 U.S. 250 (1913); Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U.S. 14 (1915).

     50 This power is not confined to the suppression of what is offensive, disorderly,

or unsanitary. Long ago Chief Justice Marshall described the police power as “that
immense mass of legislation, which embraces every thing within the territory of a
State, not surrendered to the general government.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9
Wheat.) 1, 202 (1824). See California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Works, 199 U.S. 306,

(1912); Schmidinger v. Chicago, 226 U.S. 578 (1913); Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U.S. 52,

land-use restrictions may be enacted to enhance the quality of life by preserving the
character and aesthetic features of city); City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S.
297 (1976); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976).

294 U.S. 613 (1935). “It is settled [however] that neither the ‘contract’ clause nor
the ‘due process’ clause had the effect of overriding the power of the state to estab-
lish all regulations that are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good
order, comfort, or general welfare of the community; that this power can neither be
abdicated nor bargained away, and is inalienable even by express grant; and that
all contract and property [or other vested] rights are held subject to its fair exer-
cise.” Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. City of Goldsboro, 232 U.S. 548 (1914).
