Whether the case signals a shift away from evidentiary hearing re-
quirements in the context of regulatory adjudication will depend on
future developments.835
    A delay in retrieving money paid to the government is unlikely
to rise to the level of a violation of due process. In City of Los An-
geles v. David,836 a citizen paid a $134.50 impoundment fee to re-
trieve an automobile that had been towed by the city. When he sub-
sequently sought to challenge the imposition of this impoundment
fee, he was unable to obtain a hearing until 27 days after his car
had been towed. The Court held that the delay was reasonable, as
the private interest affected—the temporary loss of the use of the
money—could be compensated by the addition of an interest pay-
ment to any refund of the fee. Further factors considered were that
a 30-day delay was unlikely to create a risk of significant factual
errors, and that shortening the delay significantly would be admin-
istratively burdensome for the city.
    In another respect, the balancing standard of Mathews has re-
sulted in states’ having wider flexibility in determining what pro-
cess is required. For instance, in an alteration of previously exist-
ing law, no hearing is required if a state affords the claimant an
adequate alternative remedy, such as a judicial action for damages
or breach of contract.837 Thus, the Court, in passing on the inflic-
tion of corporal punishment in the public schools, held that the ex-
istence of common-law tort remedies for wrongful or excessive ad-
ministration of punishment, plus the context in which the punishment
was administered (i.e., the ability of the teacher to observe directly
the infraction in question, the openness of the school environment,
the visibility of the confrontation to other students and faculty, and
the likelihood of parental reaction to unreasonableness in punish-
ment), made reasonably assured the probability that a child would
not be punished without cause or excessively.838 The Court did not,
however, inquire about the availability of judicial remedies for such
violations in the state in which the case arose.839

     837 See, e.g., Lujan v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 523 U.S. 189 (2001) (breach

of contract suit against state contractor who withheld payment to subcontractor based
on state agency determination of noncompliance with Labor Code sufficient for due
process purposes).

     839 Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 680–82 (1977). In Memphis Light, Gas &

Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 19–22 (1987), involving cutoff of utility service for
non-payment of bills, the Court rejected the argument that common-law remedies
were sufficient to obviate the pre-termination hearing requirement.
