are in good faith entitled to, but are financially unable to, procure
such insurance through ordinary methods.254
     However, the Court has discerned some limitations to such regu-
lations. A statute that prohibited the insured from contracting di-
rectly with a marine insurance company outside the state for cover-
age of property within the state was held invalid as a deprivation
of liberty without due process of law.255 For the same reason, the
Court held, a state may not prevent a citizen from concluding a
policy loan agreement with a foreign life insurance company at its
home office whereby the policy on his life is pledged as collateral
security for a cash loan to become due upon default in payment of
premiums, in which case the entire policy reserve might be applied
to discharge the indebtedness. Authority to subject such an agree-
ment to the conflicting provisions of domestic law is not deducible
from the power of a state to license a foreign insurance company
as a condition of its doing business therein.256
     A stipulation that policies of hail insurance shall take effect and
become binding twenty-four hours after the hour in which an appli-
cation is taken and further requiring notice by telegram of rejec-
tion of an application was upheld.257 No unconstitutional restraint
was imposed upon the liberty of contract of surety companies by a
statute providing that, after enactment, any bond executed for the
faithful performance of a building contract shall inure to the ben-
efit of material men and laborers, notwithstanding any provision of
the bond to the contrary.258 Likewise constitutional was a law re-
quiring that a motor vehicle liability policy shall provide that bank-
ruptcy of the insured does not release the insurer from liability to
an injured person.259 There also is no denial of due process for a
state to require that casualty companies, in case of total loss, pay
the total amount for which the property was insured, less deprecia-
tion between the time of issuing the policy and the time of the loss,
rather than the actual cash value of the property at the time of
loss.260
     Moreover, even though it had its attorney-in-fact located in Illi-
nois, signed all its contracts there, and forwarded from there all
checks in payment of losses, a reciprocal insurance association cov-
ering real property located in New York could be compelled to com-
