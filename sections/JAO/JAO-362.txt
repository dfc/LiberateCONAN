     “We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Pro-
tection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicam-
eral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.
Simply stated, an individual’s right to vote for state legislators is
unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fash-
ion diluted when compared with the votes of citizens living in other
parts of the State.” 1911 What was required was that each state “make
an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses
of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable.
We realize that it is a practical impossibility to arrange legislative
districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, or
citizens, or voters. Mathematical exactness or precision is hardly a
workable constitutional requirement.” 1912
     Among the principal issues raised by these decisions were which
units were covered by the principle, to what degree of exactness
population equality had to be achieved, and to what other ele-
ments of the apportionment and districting process the Equal Pro-
tection Clause extended.
     The first issue has largely been resolved, although a few prob-
lem areas persist. It has been held that a school board, the mem-
bers of which were appointed by boards elected in units of dispa-
rate populations, and that exercised only administrative powers rather
than legislative powers, was not subject to the principle of the ap-
portionment ruling.1913 Avery v. Midland County 1914 held that, when
a state delegates lawmaking power to local government and pro-
vides for the election by district of the officials to whom the power
is delegated, the districts must be established of substantially equal
populations. But, in Hadley v. Junior College District,1915 the Court
abandoned much of the limitation that was explicit in these two
decisions and held that, whenever a state chooses to vest “govern-
mental functions” in a body and to elect the members of that body
from districts, the districts must have substantially equal popula-
tions. The “governmental functions” should not be characterized as
attitude on the part of the Court. 377 U.S. at 589. Justices Stewart and Clark dis-
sented in two and concurred in four cases on the basis of their view that the Equal
Protection Clause was satisfied by a plan that was rational and that did not system-
atically frustrate the majority will. 377 U.S. at 741, 744.
     1911 Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 568 (1964).
     1912 377 U.S. at 577.
     1913 Sailors v. Board of Education, 387 U.S. 105 (1967).
     1914 390 U.S. 474 (1968). Justice Harlan continued his dissent from the Reyn-

olds line of cases, id. at 486, while Justices Fortas and Stewart called for a more
discerning application and would not have applied the principle to the county coun-
cil here. Id. at 495, 509.
     1915 397 U.S. 50 (1970). The governmental body here was the board of trustees

of a junior college district. Justices Harlan and Stewart and Chief Justice Burger
dissented. Id. at 59, 70.
