Adair-Coppage doctrine,126 was used to strike down legislation cal-
culated to enhance the bargaining capacity of workers as against
that already possessed by their employers.
     127 The Court did, however, on occasion sustain measures affect-

ing the employment relationship, such as a statute requiring every
corporation to furnish a departing employee a letter setting forth
the nature and duration of the employee’s service and the true cause
for leaving.128 In Senn v. Tile Layers Union,129 however, the Court

     126 Justice Black in Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal

Co., 335 U.S. 525, 535 (1949). In his concurring opinion, contained in the compan-
ion case of AFL v. American Sash & Door Co., 335 U.S. 538, 543–44 (1949), Justice
Frankfurter summarized the now obsolete doctrines employed by the Court to strike
down state laws fostering unionization. “[U]nionization encountered the shibboleths
of a premachine age and these were reflected in juridical assumptions that survived
the facts on which they were based. Adam Smith was treated as though his general-
izations had been imparted to him on Sinai and not as a thinker who addressed
himself to the elimination of restrictions which had become fetters upon initiative
and enterprise in his day. Basic human rights expressed by the constitutional con-
ception of ‘liberty’ were equated with theories of laissez faire. The result was that
economic views of confined validity were treated by lawyers and judges as though
the Framers had enshrined them in the Constitution. . . . The attitude which re-
garded any legislative encroachment upon the existing economic order as infected
with unconstitutionality led to disrespect for legislative attempts to strengthen the
wage-earners’ bargaining power. With that attitude as a premise, Adair v. United
States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908), and Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), followed logi-
cally enough; not even Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312 (1921), could be considered
unexpected.”
     127 In Adair and Coppage the Court voided statutes outlawing “yellow dog” con-

tracts whereby, as a condition of obtaining employment, a worker had to agree not
to join or to remain a member of a union; these laws, the Court ruled, impaired the
employer’s “freedom of contract”—the employer’s unrestricted right to hire and fire.
In Truax, the Court on similar grounds invalidated an Arizona statute which denied
the use of injunctions to employers seeking to restrain picketing and various other
communicative actions by striking employees. And in Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial
Court, 262 U.S. 522 (1923); 267 U.S. 552 (1925) and Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U.S. 286
(1924), the Court had also ruled that a statute compelling employers and employees
to submit their controversies over wages and hours to state arbitration was uncon-
stitutional as part of a system compelling employers and employees to continue in
business on terms not of their own making.
     128 Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U.S. 530 (1922). Added provisions that such

letters should be on plain paper selected by the employee, signed in ink and sealed,
and free from superfluous figures and words, were also sustained as not amounting
to any unconstitutional deprivation of liberty and property. Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. v.
Perry, 259 U.S. 548 (1922). In conjunction with its approval of this statute, the Court
also sanctioned judicial enforcement of a local policy rule which rendered illegal an
agreement of several insurance companies having a local monopoly of a line of insur-
ance, to the effect that no company would employ within two years anyone who had
been discharged from, or left, the service of any of the others. On the ground that
the right to strike is not absolute, the Court in a similar manner upheld a statute
under which a labor union official was punished for having ordered a strike for the
purpose of coercing an employer to pay a wage claim of a former employee. Dorchy
v. Kansas, 272 U.S. 306 (1926).
     129 301 U.S. 486 (1937).
