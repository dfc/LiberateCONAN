hibiting discrimination against homosexuals, lesbians or bisexuals,
and prohibited any state or local governmental action to either rem-
edy discrimination or grant preferences based on sexual orienta-
tion. However, the Court declined to follow the lead of the Supreme
Court of Colorado, which had held that the amendment infringed
on gays’ and lesbians’ fundamental right to participate in the politi-
cal process.2002 The Court also rejected the application of the height-
ened standard reserved for suspect classes, and sought only to es-
tablish whether the legislative classification had a rational relation
to a legitimate end.
     The Court found that the amendment failed even this re-
strained review. Animus against a class of persons was not consid-
ered by the Court as a legitimate goal of government: “[I]f the con-
stitutional conception of ‘equal protection of the laws’ means anything,
it must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a
politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate govern-
mental interest.” 2003 The Court then rejected arguments that the
amendment protected the freedom of association rights of land-
lords and employers, or that it would conserve resources in fight-
ing discrimination against other groups. The Court found that the
scope of the law was unnecessarily broad to achieve these stated
purposes, and that no other legitimate rationale existed for such a
restriction.
    In United States v. Windsor,2004 the Court struck down section
3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),2005 which provided that
for purposes of any federal act, ruling, regulation, or interpreta-
tion, the word “spouse” would mean a person of the opposite sex
who is a husband or a wife. In Windsor, the petitioner had been
married to her same-sex partner in Canada and she lived in New
York where the marriage was recognized, so she had sought to claim
a federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses.2006 The major-
ity opinion by Justice Kennedy 2007 noted that while over 1,000 fed-
eral statutes were affected by DOMA, “by history and tradition the
definition and regulation of marriage . . . has been treated as be-
ing within the authority and realm of the separate States.” 2008 The
opinion, however, de-emphasized the federalism implications of the
    2002 Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d 1270 (Colo. 1993).
    2003 517 U.S. at 634, quoting Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528,
534 (1973).
    2004 570 U.S. ___, No. 12–307, slip op. (2013).
    2005 110 Stat. 2419, 1 U.S.C. § 7.
    2006 Section 3 also provided that “marriage” would mean only a legal union be-

tween one man and one woman.
    2007 The opinion was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan.
    2008 570 U.S. ___, No. 12–307, slip op. at 14,16.
