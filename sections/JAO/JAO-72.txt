grant one if the service of common carriers is impaired thereby. A
state may also fix minimum rates applicable to such private carri-
ers, which are not less than those prescribed for common carriers,
as a valid as a means of conserving highways.364 In the absence of
legislation by Congress, a state may, to protect public safety, deny
an interstate motor carrier the use of an already congested high-
way.365
    In exercising its authority over its highways, a state is not lim-
ited to the raising of revenue for maintenance and reconstruction
or to regulating the manner in which vehicles shall be operated,
but may also prevent the wear and hazards due to excessive size of
vehicles and weight of load.366 No less constitutional is a municipal
traffic regulation that forbids the operation in the streets of any
advertising vehicle, excepting vehicles displaying business notices
or advertisements of the products of the owner and not used mainly
for advertising; and such regulation may be validly enforced to pre-
vent an express company from selling advertising space on the out-
side of its trucks.367 A state may also provide that a driver who fails
to pay a judgment for negligent operation shall have his license and
registration suspended for three years, unless, in the meantime, the
judgment is satisfied or discharged.368 Compulsory automobile in-
surance is so plainly valid as to present no federal constitutional
question.369

    364 Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U.S. 251 (1932). But any attempt to convert pri-

vate carriers into common carriers, Michigan Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Duke, 266 U.S.
570 (1925), or to subject them to the burdens and regulations of common carriers,
without expressly declaring them to be common carriers, violates due process. Frost
Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm’n, 271 U.S. 583 (1926); Smith v. Cahoon, 283 U.S.
553 (1931).
    365 Bradley v. Public Utility Comm’n, 289 U.S. 92 (1933).
    366 Accordingly, a statute limiting to 7,000 pounds the net load permissible for

trucks is not unreasonable. Sproles v. Binford, 286 U.S. 374 (1932).
    367 Because it is the judgment of local authorities that such advertising affects

public safety by distracting drivers and pedestrians, courts are unable to hold other-
wise in the absence of evidence refuting that conclusion. Railway Express Agency v.
New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949).
    368 Reitz v. Mealey, 314 U.S. 33 (1941); Kesler v. Department of Pub. Safety,

369 U.S. 153 (1962). But see Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971). Procedural due
process must, of course be observed. Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535 (1971). A nonresi-
dent owner who loans his automobile in another state, by the law of which he is
immune from liability for the borrower’s negligence and who was not in the state at
the time of the accident, is not subjected to any unconstitutional deprivation by a
law thereof, imposing liability on the owner for the negligence of one driving the car
with the owner’s permission. Young v. Masci, 289 U.S. 253 (1933).
    369 Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30 (1933). See also Packard v. Banton, 264 U.S.

140 (1924); Sprout v. City of South Bend, 277 U.S. 163 (1928); Hodge Co. v. Cincin-
nati, 284 U.S. 335 (1932); Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U.S. 352 (1932).
