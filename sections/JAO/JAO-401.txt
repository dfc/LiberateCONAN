Congressional Definition of Fourteenth Amendment Rights
    The Supreme Court’s view of congressional authority to ad-
dress racial or ethnic discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause
has varied significantly over the years. In the Civil Rights Cases,2108
the Court held that the enforcement authority of the Fourteenth
Amendment was only intended to allow Congress to overrule those
state laws that the Court already considered violative of the Amend-
ment. Under this line of reasoning, the courts would determine if a
state law was impermissible and only then would Congress have
the authority to implement that decision.2109 The Court was quite
clear that, under its responsibilities of judicial review, it was the
body that would determine that a state law was impermissible and
that a federal law passed pursuant to § 5 was necessary and proper
to enforce § 1.2110
    But, in the 1960’s case of United States v. Guest,2111 Justice Bren-
nan argued that this view “attributes a far too limited objective to
the Amendment’s sponsors,” that in fact “the primary purpose of
the Amendment was to augment the power of Congress, not the ju-
diciary.” Then, in Katzenbach v. Morgan,2112 Justice Brennan, this
time speaking for the Court, in effect overrode the limiting view
and and posited a doctrine by which Congress may define the sub-
stance of what legislation could be enacted pursuant to § 5.2113 In
Katzenbach, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a provision
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 2114 barring the application of Eng-
lish literacy requirements to a certain class of voters, despite hav-
ing previously held that such requirements did not violate equal
protection.2115
    According to Justice Brennan, Congress had the authority to ques-
tion the justifications put forward by the state in defense of its law
and conclude that the requirements were unrelated to those justifi-

use of § 1985(3) in relation to Fourteenth Amendment rights absent some state ac-
tion.
