a particular outcome if substantive predicates are found.806 In an
even more recent case, the Court limited the application of this test
to those circumstances where the restraint on freedom imposed by
the state creates an “atypical and significant hardship.” 807
    Proceedings in Which Procedural Due Process Need Not
Be Observed.—Although due notice and a reasonable opportunity
to be heard are two fundamental protections found in almost all
systems of law established by civilized countries,808 there are cer-
tain proceedings in which the enjoyment of these two conditions has
not been deemed to be constitutionally necessary. For instance, per-
sons adversely affected by a law cannot challenge its validity on
the ground that the legislative body that enacted it gave no notice
of proposed legislation, held no hearings at which the person could
have presented his arguments, and gave no consideration to particu-
lar points of view. “Where a rule of conduct applies to more than a
few people it is impracticable that everyone should have a direct
voice in its adoption. The Constitution does not require all public
acts to be done in town meeting or an assembly of the whole. Gen-
eral statutes within the state power are passed that affect the per-
son or property of individuals, sometimes to the point of ruin, with-
out giving them a chance to be heard. Their rights are protected in
the only way that they can be in a complex society, by their power,
immediate or remote, over those who make the rule.” 809
    Similarly, when an administrative agency engages in a legisla-
tive function, as, for example, when it drafts regulations of general
application affecting an unknown number of persons, it need not
afford a hearing prior to promulgation.810 On the other hand, if a
regulation, sometimes denominated an “order,” is of limited applica-
tion, that is, it affects an identifiable class of persons, the question
whether notice and hearing is required and, if so, whether it must
