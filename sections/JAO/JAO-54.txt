ing membership fees) received in all states,225 or to consent to direct

    Laws Prohibiting Trusts, Restraint of Trade or Fraud.—
Even during the period when the Court was invalidating statutes
under liberty of contract principles, it recognized the right of states
to prohibit combinations in restraint of trade.227 Thus, states could
prohibit agreements to pool and fix prices, divide net earnings, and
prevent competition in the purchase and sale of grain.228 Further,
the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude
a state from adopting a policy prohibiting competing corporations
from combinations, even when such combinations were induced by
good intentions and from which benefit and no injury have re-
sulted.229 The Court also upheld a variety of statutes prohibiting
activities taken by individual businesses intended to harm competi-
tors 230 or restrain the trade of others.231

    226  Watson v. Employers Liability Assurance Corp., 348 U.S. 66 (1954). Simi-
larly a statute requiring a foreign hospital corporation to dispose of farm land not
necessary to the conduct of their business was invalid even though the hospital, be-
cause of changed economic conditions, was unable to recoup its original investment
from the sale. New Orleans Debenture Redemption Co. v. Louisiana, 180 U.S. 320
(1901).
     227 See, e.g., Grenada Lumber Co. v. Mississippi, 217 U.S. 433 (1910) (statute

prohibiting retail lumber dealers from agreeing not to purchase materials from whole-
salers selling directly to consumers in the retailers’ localities upheld); Aikens v. Wis-
consin, 195 U.S. 194 (1904) (law punishing combinations for “maliciously” injuring a
rival in the same business, profession, or trade upheld).
     228 Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S. 447 (1905). See Waters Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas,

212 U.S. 86 (1909); National Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S. 115 (1905), also up-

intentionally destroying competition of a rival business by making sales at a lower
rate, after considering distance, in one section of the State than in another upheld).
But cf. Fairmont Co. v. Minnesota, 274 U.S. 1 (1927) (invalidating on liberty of con-
tract grounds similar statute punishing dealers in cream who pay higher prices in
one locality than in another, the Court finding no reasonable relation between the
statute’s sanctions and the anticipated evil).
     231 Old Dearborn Co. v. Seagram Corp., 299 U.S. 183 (1936) (prohibition of con-

tracts requiring that commodities identified by trademark will not be sold by the
vendee or subsequent vendees except at prices stipulated by the original vendor up-
held); Pep Boys v. Pyroil, 299 U.S. 198 (1936) (same); Safeway Stores v. Oklahoma
Grocers, 360 U.S. 334 (1959) (application of an unfair sales act to enjoin a retail
grocery company from selling below statutory cost upheld, even though competitors
were selling at unlawful prices, as there is no constitutional right to employ retalia-
tion against action outlawed by a state and appellant could enjoin illegal activity of
its competitors).
