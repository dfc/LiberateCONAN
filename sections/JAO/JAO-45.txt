ciation,” 180 “going concern value and good will,” 181 “salvage value,” 182
and “past losses and gains,” 183 only to emerge from this maze in
1944 at a point not very far removed from Munn v. Illinois and its
deference to rate-making authorities.184 By holding in FPC v. Natu-
ral Gas Pipeline Co.185 that “[t]he Constitution does not bind rate-
making bodies to the service of any single formula or combination
of formulas,” and in FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co.186 that “it is the
result reached not the method employed which is controlling, . . .
[that] [i]t is not the theory but the impact of the rate order which

Comm’n, 289 U.S. 287 (1933) and Railroad Comm’n v. Pacific Gas Co., 302 U.S. 388,
399, 405 (1938), the Court upheld respectively a valuation from which reproduction
costs had been excluded and another in which historical cost served as the rate base.
     180 Knoxville v. Water Co., 212 U.S. 1, 9–10 (1909) (considering depreciation as

part of cost). Notwithstanding its early recognition as an allowable item of deduc-
tion in determining value, depreciation continued to be the subject of controversy
arising out of the difficulty of ascertaining it and of computing annual allowances to
cover the same. Indicative of such controversy was the disagreement as to whether
annual allowances shall be in such amount as will permit the replacement of equip-
ment at current costs, i.e., present value, or at original cost. In the FPC v. Hope
Natural Gas Co. case, 320 U.S. 591, 606 (1944), the Court reversed United Rail-
ways v. West, 280 U.S. 234, 253–254 (1930), insofar as that holding rejected original
cost as the basis of annual depreciation allowances.
     181 Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U.S. 153, 165 (1915) (finding “going

concern value” in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning
money, over one not thus advanced). Franchise value and good will, on the other
hand, have been consistently excluded from valuation; the latter presumably be-
cause a utility invariably enjoys a monopoly and consumers have no choice in the
matter of patronizing it. The latter proposition has been developed in the following
cases: Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U.S. 19 (1909); Des Moines Gas Co. v.
Des Moines, 238 U.S. 153, 163–64 (1915); Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston, 258 U.S.
388 (1922); Los Angeles Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm’n, 289 U.S. 287, 313 (1933).
     182 Market Street Ry. v. Railroad Comm’n, 324 U.S. 548, 562, 564 (1945) (where

a street-surface railroad had lost all value except for scrap or salvage it was permis-
sible for a commission to consider the price at which the utility offered to sell its
property to a citizen); Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U.S. 178 (1918) (where
water company franchise has expired, but where there is no other source of supply,
its plant should be valued as actually in use rather than at what the property would
bring for some other use in case the city should build its own plant).
     183 FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 590 (1942) (“The Constitu-

tion [does not] require that the losses of . . . [a] business in one year shall be re-
stored from future earnings by the device of capitalizing the losses and adding them
to the rate base on which a fair return and depreciation allowance is to be earned”).
Nor can past losses be used to enhance the value of the property to support a claim
that rates for the future are confiscatory. Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston, 258 U.S.
388 (1922), any more than profits of the past can be used to sustain confiscatory
rates for the future Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U.S. 165, 175 (1922); Board
of Comm’rs v. New York Tel. Co., 271 U.S. 23, 31–32 (1926).
     184 94 U.S. 113 (1877).
     185 315 U.S. 575, 586 (1942).
     186 320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944). Although this and the previously cited decision arose

out of controversies involving the National Gas Act of 1938, the principles laid down
therein are believed to be applicable to the review of rate orders of state commis-
sions, except insofar as the latter operate in obedience to laws containing unique
standards or procedures.
