ing the lack of deference to the parent’s wishes and the contraven-
tion of the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the
best interests of a child.
    Liberty Interests of People with Mental Disabilities: Civil
Commitment and Treatment.—The recognition of liberty rights
for people with mental disabilities who are involuntarily commit-
ted or who voluntarily seek commitment to public institutions is
potentially a major development in substantive due process. The states,
pursuant to their parens patriae power, have a substantial interest
in institutionalizing persons in need of care, both for the protection
of such people themselves and for the protection of others.680 A state,
however, “cannot constitutionally confine without more a nondanger-
ous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by him-
self or with the help of willing and responsible family members or
friends.” 681 Moreover, a person who is constitutionally confined “en-
joys constitutionally protected interests in conditions of reasonable
care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions,
and such training as may be required by these interests.” 682 Influ-
ential lower court decisions have also found a significant right to
treatment 683 or “habilitation,” 684 although the Supreme Court’s ap-
proach in this area has been tentative.
     680 These principles have no application to persons not held in custody by the

state. DeShaney v. Winnebago County Social Servs. Dep’t, 489 U.S. 189 (1989) (no
due process violation for failure of state to protect an abused child from his parent,
even when the social service agency had been notified of possible abuse, and possi-
bility had been substantiated through visits by social worker).
     681 O’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 576 (1975). See Jackson v. Indiana,

406 U.S. 715 (1972); Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491–94 (1980).
     682 Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982). Thus, personal security con-

stitutes a “historic liberty interest” protected substantively by the due process clause.
Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977) (liberty interest in being free from
undeserved corporal punishment in school); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates,
442 U.S. 1, 18 (1979) (Justice Powell concurring) (“Liberty from bodily restraint al-
ways has been recognized as the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process
Clause from arbitrary governmental actions”).
     683 In Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972), the Court had said that

“due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some rea-
sonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.” Reasoning
that if commitment is for treatment and betterment of individuals, it must be accom-
panied by adequate treatment, several lower courts recognized a due process right.
E.g., Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F. Supp. 781 (M.D. Ala), enforced, 334 F. Supp. 1341
(1971), supplemented, 334 F. Supp. 373 and 344 F. Supp. 387 (M.D.Ala. 1972), aff’d
in part, reserved in part, and remanded sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305
(5th Cir. 1974); Donaldson v. O’Connor, 493 F.2d 507 (5th Cir. 1974), vacated on other
grounds, 422 U.S. 563 (1975).
     684 “The word ‘habilitation,’ . . . is commonly used to refer to programs for the

mentally-retarded because mental retardation is . . . a learning disability and train-
ing impairment rather than an illness. [T]he principal focus of habilitation is upon
training and development of needed skills.” Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 309
n.1 (1982) (quoting amicus brief for American Psychiatric Association; ellipses and
brackets supplied by the Court).
