cient to satisfy their claims. Thus, in Texas v. Florida,468 the State
of Texas filed an original petition in the Supreme Court against three
other states who claimed to be the domicile of the decedent, noting
that the portion of the estate within Texas alone would not suffice
to discharge its own tax, and that its efforts to collect its tax might
be defeated by adjudications of domicile by the other states. The
Supreme Court disposed of this controversy by sustaining a finding
that the decedent had been domiciled in Massachusetts, but inti-
mated that thereafter it would take jurisdiction in like situations
only in the event that an estate was valued less than the total of
the demands of the several states, so that the latter were con-
fronted with a prospective inability to collect.
    Corporate Privilege Taxes.—A domestic corporation may be
subjected to a privilege tax graduated according to paid-up capital
stock, even though the stock represents capital not subject to the
taxing power of the state, because the tax is levied not on property
but on the privilege of doing business in corporate form.469 How-
ever, a state cannot tax property beyond its borders under the guise
of taxing the privilege of doing an intrastate business. Therefore, a
license tax based on the authorized capital stock of an out-of-state
corporation is void,470 even though there is a maximum fee,471 un-
less the tax is apportioned based on property interests in the tax-


     468 306 U.S. 398 (1939). Resort to the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction was

necessary because in Worcester County Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292 (1937), the Court,
proceeding on the basis that inconsistent determinations by the courts of two states
as to the domicile of a taxpayer do not raise a substantial federal constitutional ques-
tion, held that the Eleventh Amendment precluded a suit by the estate of the dece-
dent to establish the correct state of domicile. In California v. Texas, 437 U.S. 601
(1978), a case on all points with Texas v. Florida, the Court denied leave to file an
original action to adjudicate a dispute between the two states about the actual do-
micile of Howard Hughes, a number of Justices suggesting that Worcester County
no longer was good law. Subsequently, the Court reaffirmed Worcester County, Cory
v. White, 457 U.S. 85 (1982), and then permitted an original action to proceed, Cali-
fornia v. Texas, 457 U.S. 164 (1982), several Justices taking the position that nei-
ther Worcester County nor Texas v. Florida was any longer viable.

Stiles, 242 U.S. 111 (1916). Similarly, the validity of a franchise tax, imposed on a
domestic corporation engaged in foreign maritime commerce and assessed upon a
proportion of the total franchise value equal to the ratio of local business done to
total business, is not impaired by the fact that the total value of the franchise was
enhanced by property and operations carried on beyond the limits of the state. Schwab
