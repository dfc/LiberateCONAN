down as intruding upon the discretion of the physician, and as be-
ing aimed at discouraging abortions rather than at informing the
pregnant woman’s decision.585 The Court also invalidated a 24-
hour waiting period following a woman’s written, informed con-
sent.586
    On the other hand, the Court upheld a requirement that tissue
removed in clinic abortions be submitted to a pathologist for exami-
nation, because the same requirements were imposed for in-
hospital abortions and for almost all other in-hospital surgery.587
The Court also upheld a requirement that a second physician be
present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in
saving the life of the fetus.588 Further, the Court refused to extend
Roe to require states to pay for abortions for the indigent, holding
that neither due process nor equal protection requires government
to use public funds for this purpose.589
    The equal protection discussion in the public funding case bears
closer examination because of its significance for later cases. The
equal protection question arose because public funds were being made
available for medical care to indigents, including costs attendant to
childbirth, but not for expenses associated with abortions. Admit-
tedly, discrimination based on a non-suspect class such as indigents
does not generally compel strict scrutiny. However, the question arose
as to whether such a distinction impinged upon the right to abor-
tion, and thus should be subjected to heightened scrutiny. The Court
rejected this argument and used a rational basis test, noting that
the condition that was a barrier to getting an abortion—indigency—
was not created or exacerbated by the government.

     585 City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 444–45

(1983); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S.
747 (1986). In City of Akron, the Court explained that while the state has a legiti-
mate interest in ensuring that the woman’s consent is informed, it may not demand
of the physician “a recitation of an inflexible list of information” unrelated to the
particular patient’s health, and, for that matter, may not demand that the physi-
cian rather than some other qualified person render the counseling. City of Akron,
462 U.S. 416, 448–49 (1983).
     586 City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 450–51

(1983). But see Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417 (1990) (upholding a 48-hour wait-
ing period following notification of parents by a minor).

     589 Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980).

See also Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977) (states are not required by federal law to
fund abortions); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 306–11 (same). The state restriction
in Maher, 432 U.S. at 466, applied to nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the federal
law barred funding for most medically necessary abortions as well, a distinction the
Court deemed irrelevant, Harris, 448 U.S. at 323, although it provided Justice Ste-
vens with the basis for reaching different results. Id. at 349 (dissenting).
