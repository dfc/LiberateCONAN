tured far or attempted the impossible task of extirpating politics
from what are the essentially political processes of the sovereign
States.” 1935
     In 1986, however, in a decision of potentially major import remi-
niscent of Baker v. Carr, the Court in Davis v. Bandemer 1936 ruled
that partisan gerrymandering in state legislative redistricting is jus-
ticiable under the Equal Protection Clause. But, although the vote
was 6 to 3 in favor of justiciability, a majority of Justices could not
agree on the proper test for determining whether particular gerry-
mandering is unconstitutional, and the lower court’s holding of un-
constitutionality was reversed by vote of 7 to 2.1937 Thus, although
courthouse doors were now ajar for claims of partisan gerrymander-
ing, it was unclear what it would take to succeed on the merits.
    On the justiciability issue, the Court viewed the “political ques-
tion” criteria as no more applicable than they had been in Baker v.
Carr. Because Reynolds v. Sims had declared “fair and effective rep-
resentation for all citizens” 1938 to be “the basic aim of legislative
apportionment,” and because racial gerrymandering issues had been
treated as justiciable, the Court viewed the representational issues
raised by partisan gerrymandering as indistinguishable. Agree-
ment as to the existence of “judicially discoverable and manageable
standards for resolving” gerrymandering issues, however, did not
result in a consensus as to what those standards are.1939 Although
a majority of Justices agreed that discriminatory effect as well as
discriminatory intent must be shown, there was significant disagree-
ment as to what constitutes discriminatory effect.

    1935  Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 751, 754 (1973).
    1936  478 U.S. 109 (1986). The vote on justiciability was 6–3, with Justice White’s
opinion of the Court being joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell,
and Stevens. This represented an apparent change of view by three of the majority
Justices, who just two years earlier had denied that “the existence of noncompact or
gerrymandered districts is by itself a constitutional violation.” Karcher v. Daggett,
466 U.S. 910, 917 (1983) (Justice Brennan, joined by Justices White and Marshall,
dissenting from denial of stay in challenge to district court’s rejection of a remedial
districting plan on the basis that it contained “an intentional gerrymander”).
     1937 Only Justices Powell and Stevens thought the Indiana redistricting plan void;

Justice White, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, thought the
record inadequate to demonstrate continuing discriminatory impact, and Justice
O’Connor, joined by Chief Justice Burger and by Justice Rehnquist, would have ruled
that partisan gerrymandering is nonjusticiable as constituting a political question
not susceptible to manageable judicial standards.
     1938 377 U.S. 533, 565–66 (1964). This phrase has had a life of its own in the

commentary. See D. Alfange, Jr., Gerrymandering and the Constitution: Into the Thorns
of the Thicket at Last, 1986 SUP. CT. REV. 175, and sources cited therein. It is not
clear from its original context, however, that the phrase was coined with such broad
application in mind.
     1939 The quotation is from the Baker v. Carr measure for existence of a political

question, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).
