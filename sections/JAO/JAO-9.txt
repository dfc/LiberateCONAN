ship.9 The requirement that a person be “subject to the jurisdiction
thereof,” however, excludes its application to children born of diplo-
matic representatives of a foreign state, children born of alien en-
emies in hostile occupation,10 or children of members of Indian tribes
subject to tribal laws.11 In addition, the citizenship of children born
on vessels in United States territorial waters or on the high seas
has generally been held by the lower courts to be determined by
the citizenship of the parents.12 Citizens of the United States within
the meaning of this Amendment must be natural and not artificial
persons; a corporate body is not a citizen of the United States.13
     In Afroyim v. Rusk,14 a divided Court extended the force of this
first sentence beyond prior holdings, ruling that it withdrew from
the government of the United States the power to expatriate United
States citizens against their will for any reason. “[T]he Amend-
ment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which
a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it. Once ac-
quired, this Fourteenth Amendment citizenship was not to be shifted,
canceled, or diluted at the will of the Federal Government, the States,

citizens of the United States, corporations accordingly have been declared unable to
claim the protection of that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that secures the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States against abridgment by
state legislation. Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, 172 U.S. 557, 561 (1869). This conclusion
was in harmony with the earlier holding in Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168
(1869), to the effect that corporations were not within the scope of the privileges
and immunities clause of state citizenship set out in Article IV, § 2. See also Selover,
Bates & Co. v. Walsh, 226 U.S. 112, 126 (1912); Berea College v. Kentucky, 211 U.S.

     14 387 U.S. 253 (1967). Though the Court had previously upheld the involun-

tary expatriation of a woman citizen of the United States during her marriage to a
foreign citizen in Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299 (1915), the subject first received
extended judicial treatment in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44 (1958), in which the
Court, by a five-to-four decision, upheld a statute denaturalizing a native-born citi-
zen for having voted in a foreign election. For the Court, Justice Frankfurter rea-
soned that Congress’s power to regulate foreign affairs carried with it the authority
to sever the relationship of this country with one of its citizens to avoid national
implication in acts of that citizen which might embarrass relations with a foreign
nation. Id. at 60–62. Three of the dissenters denied that Congress had any power to
denaturalize. See discussion of “Expatriation” under Article I, supra. In the years
before Afroyim, a series of decisions had curbed congressional power.
