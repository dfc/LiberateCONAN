a countervailing consideration was the impact of such discrimina-
tion on disadvantaged non-minorities. Two cases illustrate the lat-
ter point. In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,1735 the Court
invalidated a provision of a collective bargaining agreement giving
minority teachers a preferential protection from layoffs. In United
States v. Paradise,1736 the Court upheld as a remedy for past dis-
crimination a court-ordered racial quota in promotions. Justice White,
concurring in Wygant, emphasized the harsh, direct effect of layoffs
on affected non-minority employees.1737 By contrast, a plurality of
Justices in Paradise viewed the remedy in that case as affecting
non-minorities less harshly than did the layoffs in Wygant, because
the promotion quota would merely delay promotions of those af-
fected, rather than cause the loss of their jobs.1738
    A clear distinction was then drawn between federal and state
power to apply racial classifications. In City of Richmond v. J.A.
Croson Co.,1739 the Court invalidated a minority set-aside require-
ment that holders of construction contracts with the city subcon-
tract at least 30% of the dollar amount to minority business enter-
prises. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court found Richmond’s program
to be deficient because it was not tied to evidence of past discrimi-
nation in the city’s construction industry. By contrast, the Court in
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC 1740 applied a more lenient stan-
dard of review in upholding two racial preference policies used by
the FCC in the award of radio and television broadcast licenses.
The FCC policies, the Court explained, are “benign, race-conscious

    1736   480 U.S. 149 (1987).
      1737 476 U.S. at 294. A plurality of Justices in Wygant thought that past societal

discrimination alone is insufficient to justify racial classifications; they would re-
quire some convincing evidence of past discrimination by the governmental unit in-
volved. 476 U.S. at 274–76 (opinion of Justice Powell, joined by Chief Justice Burger
and by Justices Rehnquist and O’Connor).
      1738 480 U.S. at 182–83 (opinion of Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Mar-

shall, Blackmun, and Powell). A majority of Justices emphasized that the egregious
nature of the past discrimination by the governmental unit justified the ordered re-
lief. 480 U.S. at 153 (opinion of Justice Brennan), id. at 189 (Justice Stevens).
      1739 488 U.S. 469 (1989). Croson was decided by a 6–3 vote. The portions of Jus-

tice O’Connor’s opinion adopted as the opinion of the Court were joined by Chief
Justice Rehnquist and by Justices White, Stevens, and Kennedy. The latter two Jus-
tices joined only part of Justice O’Connor’s opinion; each added a separate concur-
ring opinion. Justice Scalia concurred separately; Justices Marshall, Brennan, and
Blackmun dissented.
      1740 497 U.S. 547 (1990). This was a 5–4 decision, Justice Brennan’s opinion of

the Court being joined by Justices White, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens. Justice
O’Connor wrote a dissenting opinion joined by the Chief Justice and by Justices Scalia
and Kennedy, and Justice Kennedy added a separate dissenting opinion joined by
Justice Scalia.
