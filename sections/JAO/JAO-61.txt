     The Court has also upheld a variety of other licensing or regu-
latory legislation applicable to places of amusement,277 grain eleva-
tors,278 detective agencies,279 the sale of cigarettes 280 or cosmet-
ics,281 and the resale of theater tickets.282 Restrictions on advertising
have also been upheld, including absolute bans on the advertising
of cigarettes 283 or the use of a representation of the United States
flag on an advertising medium.284 Similarly constitutional were pro-
hibitions on the solicitation by a layman of the business of collect-
ing and adjusting claims,285 the keeping of private markets within
six squares of a public market,286 the keeping of billiard halls ex-
cept in hotels,287 or the purchase by junk dealers of wire, copper,

Protection of State Resources
    Oil and Gas.—A state may prohibit conduct that leads to the
waste of natural resources.289 Thus, for instance, where there is a
limited market for natural gas acquired attendant to oil production
or where the pumping of oil and gas from one location may limit
the ability of others to recover oil from a large reserve, a state may
require that production of oil be limited or prorated among produc-

     288 Rosenthal v. New York, 226 U.S. 260 (1912). The Court also upheld a state

law forbidding (1) solicitation of the sale of frames, mountings, or other optical ap-
pliances, (2) solicitation of the sale of eyeglasses, lenses, or prisms by use of adver-
tising media, (3) retailers from leasing, or otherwise permitting anyone purporting
to do eye examinations or visual care to occupy space in a retail store, and (4) any-
one, such as an optician, to fit lenses, or replace lenses or other optical appliances,
except upon written prescription of an optometrist or ophthalmologist licensed in
the state is not invalid. A state may treat all who deal with the human eye as mem-
bers of a profession that should refrain from merchandising methods to obtain cus-
tomers, and that should choose locations that reduce the temptations of commercial-
ism; a state may also conclude that eye examinations are so critical that every change
in frame and duplication of a lens should be accompanied by a prescription. William-

price, based on a finding that low field prices for natural gas were resulting in eco-
nomic and physical waste); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Oklahoma, 340 U.S. 190 (1950).
