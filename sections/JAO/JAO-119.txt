ment.629 Also, the Court has held that First Amendment itself af-
fords some limitation upon governmental acquisition of informa-
tion, although only where the exposure of such information would
violate freedom of association or the like.630
     Similarly, in Fisher v. United States,631 the Court held that the
Fifth Amendment’s Self-incrimination Clause did not prevent the
IRS from obtaining income tax records prepared by accountants and
in the hands of either the taxpayer or his attorney, no matter how
incriminating, because the Amendment only protects against com-
pelled testimonial self-incrimination. The Court noted that it “has
never suggested that every invasion of privacy violates the privi-
lege. Within the limits imposed by the language of the Fifth Amend-
ment, which we necessarily observe, the privilege truly serves pri-
vacy interests; but the Court has never on any ground, personal
privacy included, applied the Fifth Amendment to prevent the oth-
erwise proper acquisition or use of evidence that, in the Court’s view,
did not involve compelled testimonial self-incrimination of some
sort.” 632 Furthermore, it wrote, “[w]e cannot cut the Fifth Amend-
ment completely loose from the moorings of its language, and make
it serve as a general protector of privacy—a word not mentioned in
its text and a concept directly addressed in the Fourth Amend-
ment.” 633
     So what remains of informational privacy? A cryptic opinion in
Whalen v. Roe 634 may indicate the Court’s continuing willingness
to recognize privacy interests as independent constitutional rights.
At issue was a state’s pervasive regulation of prescription drugs with
abuse potential, and a centralized computer record-keeping system
through which prescriptions, including patient identification, could
be stored. The scheme was attacked on the basis that it invaded
privacy interests against disclosure and privacy interests involving
autonomy of persons in choosing whether to have the medication.
The Court appeared to agree that both interests are protected, but
    629 The Bank Secrecy Act required the banks to retain cancelled checks. The

Court held that the checks were business records of the bank in which the deposi-
tors had no expectation of privacy and therefore there was no Fourth Amendment
standing to challenge government legal process directed to the bank, and this sta-
tus was unchanged by the fact that the banks kept the records under government
mandate in the first place.

601 n.27, 604 n.32 (1977); United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 444 n.6 (1976). The
Court continues to reserve the question of the “[s]pecial problems of privacy which
might be presented by subpoena of a personal diary.” Fisher v. United States, 425
