ing of property for which compensation must be paid.52 Thus, the
means employed to effect its exercise may be neither arbitrary nor
oppressive but must bear a real and substantial relation to an end
that is public, specifically, the public health, safety, or morals, or
some other aspect of the general welfare.53
    An ulterior public advantage, however, may justify a compara-
tively insignificant taking of private property for what seems to be
a private use.54 Mere “cost and inconvenience (different words, prob-
ably, for the same thing) would have to be very great before they
could become an element in the consideration of the right of a state
to exert its reserved power or its police power.” 55 Moreover, it is
elementary that enforcement of a law passed in the legitimate ex-
ertion of the police power is not a taking without due process of
law, even if the cost is borne by the regulated.56 Initial compliance
with a regulation that is valid when adopted, however, does not pre-
clude later protest if that regulation subsequently becomes confis-
catory in its operation.57
    “Liberty”.—As will be discussed in detail below, the substan-
tive “liberty” guaranteed by the Due Process Clause has been vari-
ously defined by the Court. In the early years, it meant almost ex-
clusively “liberty of contract,” but with the demise of liberty of contract
came a general broadening of “liberty” to include personal, political
and social rights and privileges.58 Nonetheless, the Court is gener-
ally chary of expanding the concept absent statutorily recognized
rights.59

     58 See the tentative effort in Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 102 &

n.23 (1976), apparently to expand upon the concept of “liberty” within the meaning
of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and necessarily therefore the Four-
teenth’s.

215 (1976); and Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236 (1976), in which the Court ap-
plied to its determination of what is a liberty interest the “entitlement” doctrine
developed in property cases, in which the interest is made to depend upon state
recognition of the interest through positive law, an approach contrary to previous
