mental treatment of those attempting to exercise the right.1434 Thus,
state limitation on the entry into marriage was soon denominated
an incursion on a fundamental right that required a compelling jus-
tification.1435 Although denials of public funding of abortions were
held to implicate no fundamental interest—abortion’s being a fun-
damental interest—and no suspect classification—because only poor
women needed public funding 1436—other denials of public assis-
tance because of illegitimacy, alienage, or sex have been deemed to
be governed by the same standard of review as affirmative harms
imposed on those grounds.1437 And, in Plyler v. Doe,1438 the com-
plete denial of education to the children of illegal aliens was found
subject to intermediate scrutiny and invalidated.
    Thus, the nature of active review in equal protection jurispru-
dence remains in flux, subject to shifting majorities and varying de-
grees of concern about judicial activism and judicial restraint. But
the cases, more fully reviewed hereafter, clearly indicate that a slid-
ing scale of review is a fact of the Court’s cases, however much its
doctrinal explanation lags behind.

Testing Facially Neutral Classifications Which Impact on
  Minorities
     A classification made expressly upon the basis of race triggers
strict scrutiny and ordinarily results in its invalidation; similarly,
a classification that facially makes a distinction on the basis of sex,
or alienage, or illegitimacy triggers the level of scrutiny appropri-
ate to it. A classification that is ostensibly neutral but is an obvi-
ous pretext for racial discrimination or for discrimination on some
other forbidden basis is subject to heightened scrutiny and ordinar-
ily invalidation.1439 But when it is contended that a law, which is
in effect neutral, has a disproportionately adverse effect upon a ra-
cial minority or upon another group particularly entitled to the pro-
tection of the Equal Protection Clause, a much more difficult case
is presented.

238 U.S. 347 (1915); Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 (1939); Gomillion v. Lightfoot,
364 U.S. 339 (1960). Government may make a racial classification that, for ex-
ample, does not separate whites from blacks but that by focusing on an issue of
racial import creates a classification that is suspect. Washington v. Seattle School
Dist., 458 U.S. 457, 467–74 (1982).
