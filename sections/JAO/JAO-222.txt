as by limiting the right to petition for habeas corpus, is to deny the
convicted defendant his constitutional rights.1183
     The mode by which federal constitutional rights are to be vindi-
cated after conviction is for the government concerned to deter-
mine. “Wide discretion must be left to the States for the manner of
adjudicating a claim that a conviction is unconstitutional. States
are free to devise their own systems of review in criminal cases. A
State may decide whether to have direct appeals in such cases, and
if so under what circumstances. . . . In respecting the duty laid upon
them . . . States have a wide choice of remedies. A State may pro-
vide that the protection of rights granted by the Federal Constitu-
tion be sought through the writ of habeas corpus or coram nobis. It
may use each of these ancient writs in its common law scope, or it
may put them to new uses; or it may afford remedy by a simple
motion brought either in the court of original conviction or at the
place of detention. . . . So long as the rights under the United States
Constitution may be pursued, it is for a State and not for this Court
to define the mode by which they may be vindicated.” 1184 If a state
provides a mode of redress, then a defendant must first exhaust
that mode. If he is unsuccessful, or if a state does not provide an
adequate mode of redress, then the defendant may petition a fed-
eral court for relief through a writ of habeas corpus.1185
    When appellate or other corrective process is made available,
because it is no less a part of the process of law under which a
defendant is held in custody, it becomes subject to scrutiny for any
alleged unconstitutional deprivation of life or liberty. At first, the
Court seemed content to assume that, when a state appellate pro-
cess formally appeared to be sufficient to correct constitutional er-
rors committed by the trial court, the conclusion by the appellate
court that the trial court’s sentence of execution should be affirmed
was ample assurance that life would not be forfeited without due
process of law.1186 But, in Moore v. Dempsey,1187 while insisting that
it was not departing from precedent, the Court directed a federal
district court in which petitioners had sought a writ of habeas cor-
pus to make an independent investigation of the facts alleged by
the petitioners—mob domination of their trial—notwithstanding that

     1185 In Case v. Nebraska, 381 U.S. 336 (1965) (per curiam), the Court had taken

for review a case that raised the issue of whether a state could simply omit any
corrective process for hearing and determining claims of federal constitutional viola-
tions, but it dismissed the case when the state in the interim enacted provisions for
such process. Justices Clark and Brennan each wrote a concurring opinion.
