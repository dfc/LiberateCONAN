dren in school,1872 and denied states the right to restrict the vote
to property owners in elections on the issuance of revenue bonds 1873
or general obligation bonds.1874 By contrast, the Court upheld a stat-
ute that required voters to present a government-issued photo iden-
tification in order to vote, as the state had not “required voters to
pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new photo identification.” The Court
added that, although obtaining a government-issued photo identifi-
cation is an “inconvenience” to voters, it “surely does not qualify as
a substantial burden.” 1875
     The Court has also held that, because the activities of a water
storage district fell so disproportionately on landowners as a group,
a limitation of the franchise in elections for the district’s board of
directors to landowners, whether resident or not and whether natu-
ral persons or not, excluding non-landowning residents and lessees
of land, and weighing the votes granted according to assessed valu-
ation of land, comported with equal protection standards.1876 Advert-
ing to the reservation in prior local governmental unit election cases 1877
that some functions of such units might be so specialized as to per-
mit deviation from the usual rules, the Court then proceeded to as-
sess the franchise restrictions according to the traditional stan-
dards of equal protection rather than by those of strict scrutiny.1878
Also narrowly approached was the issue of the effect of the Dis-
trict’s activities, the Court focusing upon the assessments against
landowners as the sole means of paying expenses rather than addi-
tionally noting the impact upon lessees and non-landowning resi-
dents of such functions as flood control. The approach taken in this
     1872 Kramer v. Union Free School Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969). The Court as-

sumed without deciding that the franchise in some circumstances could be limited
to those “primarily interested” or “primarily affected” by the outcome, but found that
the restriction permitted some persons with no interest to vote and disqualified oth-
ers with an interest. Justices Stewart, Black, and Harlan dissented. Id. at 594.
     1873 Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U.S. 701 (1969). Justices Black, Harlan, and

Stewart concurred specially. Id. at 707.
     1874 City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204 (1970). Justice Stewart and

Chief Justice Burger dissented. Id. at 215. In Hill v. Stone, 421 U.S. 289 (1975), the
Court struck down a limitation on the right to vote on a general obligation bond
issue to persons who have “rendered” or listed real, mixed, or personal property for
taxation in the election district. It was not a “special interest” election since a gen-
eral obligation bond issue is a matter of general interest.

     1876 Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Water Storage Dist., 410 U.S. 719 (1973). See also

Associated Enterprises v. Toltec Watershed Improv. Dist., 410 U.S. 743 (1973) (limi-
tation of franchise to property owners in the creation and maintenance of district
upheld). Justices Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall dissented in both cases. Id. at

     1877 410 U.S. at 727–28.
     1878 410 U.S. at 730, 732. Thus, the Court posited reasons that might have moved

the legislature to adopt the exclusions.
