between consenting adults.” 649 Instead, the Court found Stanley “firmly
grounded in the First Amendment,” 650 and noted that extending the
reasoning of that case to homosexual conduct would result in pro-
tecting all voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, in-
cluding adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes. Although Bowers
has since been overruled by Lawrence v. Texas 651 based on pre-
cepts of personal autonomy, the latter case did not appear to signal
the resurrection of the doctrine of protecting activities occurring in
private places.
     So, what of the expansion of the right to privacy under the ru-
bric of personal autonomy? The Court speaking in Roe in 1973 made
it clear that, despite the importance of its decision, the protection
of personal autonomy was limited to a relatively narrow range of
behavior. “The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right
of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, . . . the Court has recog-
nized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain ar-
eas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. . . . These
decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed
‘fundamental’ or ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ Palko v.
Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937), are included in this guaran-
tee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has
some extension to activities relating to marriage, Loving v. Vir-
ginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316
U.S. 535, 541–42 (1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S.
at 453–54; id. at 460, 463–65 (White, J., concurring in result); fam-
ily relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944);
and child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.
510, 535 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, supra.” 652
    Despite the limiting language of Roe, the concept of privacy still
retained sufficient strength to occasion major constitutional deci-
sions. For instance, in the 1977 case of Carey v. Population Ser-
vices Int’l,653 recognition of the “constitutional protection of indi-
vidual autonomy in matters of childbearing” led the Court to invalidate
a state statute that banned the distribution of contraceptives to adults
except by licensed pharmacists and that forbade any person to sell

     649 478 U.S. at 195–96. Dissenting, Justice Blackmun challenged the Court’s char-

acterization of Stanley, suggesting that it had rested as much on the Fourth as on
the First Amendment, and that “the right of an individual to conduct intimate rela-
tionships in . . . his or her own home [is] at the heart of the Constitution’s protec-
tion of privacy.” Id. at 207–08.
