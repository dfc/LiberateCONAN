Juries
    It has been established since Strauder v. West Virginia 1659 that
exclusion of an identifiable racial or ethnic group from a grand jury 1660
that indicts a defendant or a from petit jury 1661 that tries him, or
from both,1662 denies a defendant of the excluded race equal protec-
tion and necessitates reversal of his conviction or dismissal of his
indictment.1663 Even if the defendant’s race differs from that of the
excluded jurors, the Court held, the defendant has third-party stand-
ing to assert the rights of jurors excluded on the basis of race.1664
“Defendants in criminal proceedings do not have the only cogni-
zable legal interest in nondiscriminatory jury selection. People ex-
cluded from juries because of their race are as much aggrieved as
those indicted and tried by juries chosen under a system of racial
exclusion.” 1665 Thus, persons may bring actions seeking affirmative

tion on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude in jury selection
has also been statutorily illegal since enactment of § 4 of the Civil Rights Act of
1875, 18 Stat. 335, 18 U.S.C. § 243. See Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880). In
Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), the Court found jury discrimination against
Mexican-Americans to be a denial of equal protection, a ruling it reiterated in Castaneda
v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482 (1977), finding proof of discrimination by statistical dispari-
ties, even though Mexican-surnamed individuals constituted a governing majority of
the county and a majority of the selecting officials were Mexican-American.

     1663 Even if there is no discrimination in the selection of the petit jury which

convicted him, a defendant who shows discrimination in the selection of the grand
jury which indicted him is entitled to a reversal of his conviction. Cassell v. Texas,
339 U.S. 282 (1950); Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625 (1972); Vasquez v. Hillery,
474 U.S. 254 (1986) (habeas corpus remedy).

392 (1998) (grand jury). See also Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493 (1972) (defendant en-
titled to have his conviction or indictment set aside if he proves such exclusion).
The Court in 1972 was substantially divided with respect to the reason for rejecting
the “same class” rule—that the defendant be of the excluded class—but in Taylor v.
Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), involving a male defendant and exclusion of women,
the Court ascribed the result to the fair-cross-section requirement of the Sixth Amend-
ment, which would have application across-the-board.
