cially based gerrymandering is unconstitutional under the Fif-
teenth Amendment, at least when it is accomplished through the
manipulation of district lines.1929 Even if racial gerrymandering is
intended to benefit minority voting populations, it is subject to strict
scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause if racial considerations
are the dominant and controlling rationale in drawing district lines.1930
Showing that a district’s “bizarre” shape departs from traditional
districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and respect
for political subdivision lines may serve to reinforce such a claim,1931
although a plurality of the Justices would not preclude the cre-
ation of “reasonably compact” majority-minority districts in order
to remedy past discrimination or to comply with the requirements
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.1932 On the other hand, the Court
appears to have more recently weakened a challenger’s ability to
establish equal protection claims by showing both a strong defer-
ence to a legislature’s articulation of legitimate political explana-
tions for districting decisions, and by allowing for a strong correla-

    Partisan or “political” gerrymandering raises more difficult is-
sues. Several lower courts ruled that the issue was beyond judicial
cognizance,1934 and the Supreme Court itself, upholding an appor-
tionment plan frankly admitted to have been drawn with the in-
tent to achieve a rough approximation of the statewide political
strengths of the two parties, recognized the goal as legitimate and
