had ever served on a jury and that some exclusions were not the
result of defense peremptory challenges, the defendant’s claims were
rejected.
     The Swain holding as to the evidentiary standard was over-
ruled in Batson v. Kentucky, the Court ruling that “a defendant may
establish a prima facie case of purposeful [racial] discrimination in
selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecu-
tor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s [own]
trial.” 1674 To rebut this showing, the prosecutor “must articulate a
neutral explanation related to the particular case,” but the explana-
tion “need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for
cause.” 1675 In fact, “[a]lthough the prosecutor must present a com-
prehensible reason, ‘[t]he [rebuttal] does not demand an explana-
tion that is persuasive, or even plausible’; so long as the reason is
not inherently discriminatory, it suffices.” 1676 Such a rebuttal hav-
ing been offered, “the court must then determine whether the defen-
dant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.
This final step involves evaluating ‘the persuasiveness of the justi-
fication’ proffered by the prosecutor, but the ‘ultimate burden of per-
suasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from,


     1674 476 U.S. 79, 96 (1986). Establishing a prima facie case can be done through

a “wide variety of evidence, so long as the sum of proffered facts gives rise to an
inference of discriminatory purpose.” Id. at 93–94. A state, however, cannot require
that a defendant prove a prima facie case under a “more likely than not” standard,
as the function of the Batson test is to create an inference and shift the burden to
the state to offer race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenges. Only then does
a court weigh the likelihood that racial discrimination occurred. Johnson v. Califor-
nia, 543 U.S. 499 (2005).
     1675 476 U.S. at 98 (1986). The principles were applied in Trevino v. Texas, 503

U.S. 562 (1991), holding that a criminal defendant’s allegation of a state’s pattern of
historical and habitual use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of racial
minorities was sufficient to raise an equal protection claim under Swain as well as
Batson. In Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), a prosecutor was held to
have sustained his burden of providing a race-neutral explanation for using peremp-
tory challenges to strike bilingual Latino jurors; the prosecutor had explained that,
based on the answers and demeanor of the prospective jurors, he had doubted whether
they would accept the interpreter’s official translation of trial testimony by Spanish-
speaking witnesses. The Batson ruling applies to cases pending on direct review or
not yet final when Batson was decided, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987),
but does not apply to a case on federal habeas corpus review, Allen v. Hardy, 478
U.S. 255 (1986).
     1676 Rice v. Collins, 546 U.S. 333, 338 (2006) (citation omitted). The holding of

the case was that, in a habeas corpus action, the Ninth Circuit “panel majority im-
properly substituted its evaluation of the record for that of the state trial court.” Id.
at 337–38. Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Souter, concurred but suggested “that
legal life without peremptories is no longer unthinkable” and “that we should recon-
sider Batson’s test and the peremptory challenge system as a whole.” Id. at 344.
