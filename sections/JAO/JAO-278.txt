commerce, while the Equal Protection Clause merely requires a ra-
tional relation to a valid state purpose.1492 However, the Court’s hold-
ing that the discriminatory purpose was invalid under equal protec-
tion analysis would also be a basis for invalidation under a different
strand of Commerce Clause analysis.1493
    Income Taxes.—A state law that taxes the entire income of do-
mestic corporations that do business in the state, including that de-
rived within the state, while exempting entirely the income re-
ceived outside the state by domestic corporations that do no local
business, is arbitrary and invalid.1494 In taxing the income of a non-
resident, there is no denial of equal protection in limiting the de-
duction of losses to those sustained within the state, although resi-
dents are permitted to deduct all losses, wherever incurred.1495 A
retroactive statute imposing a graduated tax at rates different from
those in the general income tax law, on dividends received in a prior
year that were deductible from gross income under the law in ef-
fect when they were received, does not violate the Equal Protection
Clause.1496
    Inheritance Taxes.—There is no denial of equal protection in
prescribing different treatment for lineal relations, collateral kin-
dred and unrelated persons, or in increasing the proportionate bur-
den of the tax progressively as the amount of the benefit in-
creases.1497 A tax on life estates where the remainder passes to lineal
heirs is valid despite the exemption of life estates where the remain-
der passes to collateral heirs.1498 There is no arbitrary classifica-
tion in taxing the transmission of property to a brother or sister,
while exempting that to a son-in-law or daughter-in-law.1499 Vested
and contingent remainders may be treated differently.1500 The ex-

    1493  The first level of the Court’s “two-tiered” analysis of state statutes affecting
commerce tests for virtual per se invalidity. “When a state statute directly regulates
or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state
economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the
statute without further inquiry.” Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State
