     In addition, jury selection was found to be a traditional govern-
mental function: the jury “is a quintessential governmental body,
having no attributes of a private actor,” and it followed, so the Court
majority believed, that selection of individuals to serve on that body
is also a governmental function whether or not it is delegated to or
shared with private individuals.1337 Finally, the Court concluded that
“the injury caused by the discrimination is made more severe be-
cause the government permits it to occur within the courthouse it-
self.” 1338 Dissenting Justice O’Connor complained that the Court was
wiping away centuries of adversary practice in which “unre-
strained private choice” has been recognized in exercise of peremp-
tory challenges; “[i]t is antithetical to the nature of our adversarial
process,” the Justice contended, “to say that a private attorney act-
ing on behalf of a private client represents the government for con-
stitutional purposes.” 1339
     The Court soon applied these same principles to hold that the
exercise of peremptory challenges by the defense in a criminal case
also constitutes state action,1340 even though in a criminal case it
is the government and the defendant who are adversaries. The same
generalities apply with at least equal force: there is overt and sig-
nificant governmental assistance in creating and structuring the pro-
cess, a criminal jury serves an important governmental function and
its selection is also important, and the courtroom setting intensi-
fies harmful effects of discriminatory actions. An earlier case 1341 hold-
ing that a public defender was not a state actor when engaged in
general representation of a criminal defendant was distinguished,
with the Court emphasizing that “exercise of a peremptory chal-
lenge differs significantly from other actions taken in support of a
defendant’s defense,” because it involves selection of persons to wield
governmental power.1342

     1340 Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992). It was, of course, beyond dispute

that a prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action. See
Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).
     1341 Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 512 (1981).
     1342 505 U.S. at 54. Justice O’Connor, again dissenting, pointed out that the Court’s

distinction was inconsistent with Dodson’s declaration that public defenders are not
vested with state authority “when performing a lawyer’s traditional functions as coun-
sel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.” Id. at 65–66. Justice Scalia, also dis-
senting again, decried reduction of Edmonson “to the terminally absurd: A criminal
defendant, in the process of defending himself against the state, is held to be acting
on behalf of the state.” Id. at 69–70. Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had dissented in
Edmonson, concurred in McCollum in the belief that it was controlled by Edmonson,
and Justice Thomas, who had not participated in Edmonson, expressed similar views
in a concurrence.
