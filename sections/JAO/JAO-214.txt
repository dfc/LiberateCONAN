nal responsibility.1137 The Court has identified several tests that are
used by states in varying combinations to address the issue: the
M’Naghten test (cognitive incapacity or moral incapacity),1138 voli-
tional incapacity,1139 and the irresistible-impulse test.1140 “[I]t is clear
that no particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due
process, and that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of crimi-
nal offenses, is substantially open to state choice.” 1141
     Commitment to a mental hospital of a criminal defendant ac-
quitted by reason of insanity does not offend due process, and the
period of confinement may extend beyond the period for which the
person could have been sentenced if convicted.1142 The purpose of
the confinement is not punishment, but treatment, and the Court
explained that the length of a possible criminal sentence “therefore
is irrelevant to the purposes of . . . commitment.” 1143 Thus, the
insanity-defense acquittee may be confined for treatment “until such
time as he has regained his sanity or is no longer a danger to him-
self or society.” 1144 It follows, however, that a state may not indefi-
nitely confine an insanity-defense acquittee who is no longer men-
tally ill but who has an untreatable personality disorder that may
lead to criminal conduct.1145

    1137  Clark v. Arizona, 548 U.S. 735 (2006).
    1138  M’Naghten’s Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843), states that “[T]o establish a de-
fence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the
committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason,
from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was
doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.” 8
Eng. Rep., at 722.
     1139 See Queen v. Oxford, 173 Eng. Rep. 941, 950 (1840) (“If some controlling

disease was, in truth, the acting power within [the defendant] which he could not
resist, then he will not be responsible”).
     1140 See State v. Jones, 50 N.H. 369 (1871) (“If the defendant had a mental dis-

ease which irresistibly impelled him to kill his wife—if the killing was the product
of mental disease in him—he is not guilty; he is innocent—as innocent as if the act
had been produced by involuntary intoxication, or by another person using his hand
against his utmost resistance”).
     1141 Clark, 548 U.S. at 752. In Clark, the Court considered an Arizona statute,

based on the M’Naghten case, that was amended to eliminate the defense of cogni-
tive incapacity. The Court noted that, despite the amendment, proof of cognitive in-
capacity could still be introduced as it would be relevant (and sufficient) to prove
the remaining moral incapacity test. Id. at 753.
     1142 Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354 (1983). The fact that the affirmative

defense of insanity need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence,
while civil commitment requires the higher standard of clear and convincing evi-
dence, does not render the former invalid; proof beyond a reasonable doubt of com-
mission of a criminal act establishes dangerousness justifying confinement and elimi-
nates the risk of confinement for mere idiosyncratic behavior.

     1144 463 U.S. at 370.
