not sex. The plurality observed that paid sick leave and disability
protection were almost universally available to state employees with-
out intended or incidental gender bias. The addition of unpaid self
care leave to this state benefit might help some women suffering
pregnancy related illness, but the establishment of a broad self care
leave program under the FMLA was not a proportional or congru-
ent remedy to protect any constitutionally based right under the
circumstances.2153
     The Court in Tennessee v. Lane 2154 held that Congress could au-
thorize damage suits against a state for failing to provide disabled
persons physical access to its courts. Title II of the Americans with
Disabilities Act provides that no qualified person shall be excluded
or denied the benefits of a public program by reason of a disabil-
ity,2155 but since disability is not a suspect class, the application of
Title II against states would seem questionable under the reason-
ing of Garrett.2156 Here, however, the Court evaluated the case as a
limit on access to court proceedings, which, in some instances, has
been held to be a fundamental right subject to heightened scrutiny
under the Due Process Clause.2157
    Reviewing the legislative history of the ADA, the Court found
that Title II, as applied, was a congruent and proportional re-
sponse to a Congressional finding of “a backdrop of pervasive un-
equal treatment in the administration of state services and pro-
grams, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.” 2158
However, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out in dissent, the depriva-
tions the majority relied on were not limited to instances of impos-
ing unconstitutional deprivations of court access to disabled per-
sons.2159 Rather, in an indication of a more robust approach where
protection of fundamental rights is at issue, the majority also re-
lied more broadly on a history of state limitations on the rights of

     2153 Justice Ginsburg, writing for herself and three others, extensively reviewed

the historical and legislative record and concluded that the family care and the self
care provisions were of the same cloth. Both provisions grew out of concern for dis-
crimination against pregnant workers, and, the FMLA’s leave provisions were not,
in the dissent’s opinion, susceptible to being rent into separate pieces for analytical
purposes.
