and a careful review of how well the classification serves, or “fits,”
the aim.1844 The common rationale of all the illegitimacy cases is
not clear, is in many respects not wholly consistent,1845 but the theme
that seems to be imposed on them by the more recent cases is that
so long as the challenged statute does not so structure its conferral
of rights, benefits, or detriments that some illegitimates who would
otherwise qualify in terms of the statute’s legitimate purposes are
disabled from participation, the imposition of greater burdens upon
illegitimates or some classes of illegitimates than upon legitimates
is permissible.1846
    Intestate succession rights for illegitimates has divided the Court
over the entire period. At first adverting to the broad power of the
states over descent of real property, the Court employed relaxed scru-
tiny to sustain a law denying illegitimates the right to share equally
with legitimates in the estate of their common father, who had ac-
knowledged the illegitimates but who had died intestate.1847 Labine
was strongly disapproved, however, and virtually overruled in Trimble


      1844 Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 503–06 (1976); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S.

762, 766–67 (1977); Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259, 265 (1978). Scrutiny in previous
cases had ranged from negligible, Labine v. Vincent, 401 U.S. 532 (1971), to some-
thing approaching strictness, Jiminez v. Weinberger, 417 U.S. 628, 631–632 (1974).
Mathews itself illustrates the uncertainty of statement, suggesting at one point that
the Labine standard may be appropriate, 401 U.S. at 506, and at another that the
standard appropriate to sex classifications is to be used, id. at 510, while observing
a few pages earlier that illegitimacy is entitled to less exacting scrutiny than either
race or sex. Id. at 506. Trimble settles on intermediate scrutiny but does not assess
the relationship between its standard and the sex classification standard. See Parham
v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347 (1979), and Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380 (1979) (both
cases involving classifications reflecting both sex and illegitimacy interests).
      1845 The major inconsistency arises from three 5-to-4 decisions. Labine v. Vin-

cent, 401 U.S. 532 (1971), was largely overruled by Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762
(1977), which itself was substantially limited by Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259 (1978).
Justice Powell was the swing vote for different disposition of the latter two cases.
Thus, while four Justices argued for stricter scrutiny and usually invalidation of
such classifications, Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. at 277 (Justices Brennan, White, Mar-
shall, and Stevens dissenting), and four favor relaxed scrutiny and usually sustain-
ing the classifications, Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. at 776, 777 (Chief Justice Burger
and Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Rehnquist dissenting), Justice Powell applied
his own intermediate scrutiny and selectively voided and sustained. See Lalli v. Lalli,
supra (plurality opinion by Justice Powell).
      1846 A classification that absolutely distinguishes between legitimates and il-

legitimates is not alone subject to such review; one that distinguishes among classes
of illegitimates is also subject to it, Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 774 (1977), as
indeed are classifications based on other factors. E.g., Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S.
1, 9 (1977) (alienage).
      1847 Labine v. Vincent, 401 U.S. 532 (1971). Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety

Co., 406 U.S. 164, 170 (1972), had confined the analysis of Labine to the area of
state inheritance laws in expanding review of illegitimacy classifications.
