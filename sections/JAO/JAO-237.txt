for abuse but balanced this against such factors as the responsibil-
ity of parents for the care and nurture of their children and the
legal presumption that parents usually act in behalf of their chil-
dren’s welfare, the independent role of medical professionals in de-
ciding to accept the children for admission, and the real possibility
that the institution of an adversary proceeding would both deter
parents from acting in good faith to institutionalize children need-
ing such care and interfere with the ability of parents to assist with
the care of institutionalized children.1264 Similarly, the same con-
cerns, reflected in the statutory obligation of the state to care for
children in its custody, caused the Court to apply the same stan-
dards to involuntary commitment by the government.1265 Left to fu-
ture resolution was the question of the due process requirements
for postadmission review of the necessity for continued confine-
ment.1266

                 EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS

Scope and Application
     State Action.—The Fourteenth Amendment, by its terms, lim-
its discrimination only by governmental entities, not by private par-
ties.1267 As the Court has noted, “the action inhibited by the first
section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may
fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no
shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or
wrongful.” 1268 Although state action requirements also apply to other
provisions of the Constitution 1269 and to federal governmental ac-
    1264  442 U.S. at 598–617. The dissenters agreed on this point. Id. at 626–37.
    1265  442 U.S. at 617–20. The dissenters would have required a preconfinement
hearing. Id. at 637–38.
     1266 442 U.S. at 617. The dissent would have mandated a formal postadmission

hearing. Id. at 625–26.
     1267 The Amendment provides that “[n]o State” and “nor shall any State” en-

gage in the proscribed conduct. There are, of course, numerous federal statutes that
prohibit discrimination by private parties. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title
II, 78 Stat. 241, 243, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a et seq. These statutes, however, are gener-
ally based on Congress’s power to regulate commerce. See Katzenbach v. McClung,
379 U.S. 294 (1964); Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964).
     1268 Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948). “It is State action of a particular

character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-
matter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes
void all State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the privi-
leges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life,
liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the
equal protection of the laws.” Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 11 (1883).
     1269 The doctrine applies to other rights protected of the Fourteenth Amend-

ment, such as privileges and immunities and failure to provide due process. It also
applies to Congress’s enforcement powers under section 5 of the Amendment. For
discussion of the latter, see Section 5, Enforcement, “State Action,” infra. Several
