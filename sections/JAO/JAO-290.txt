receive, regardless of the number of children in the family, so that
the more children in a family the less money per child was re-
ceived, was found to be rationally related to the legitimate state
interest in encouraging employment and in maintaining an equi-
table balance between welfare families and the families of the work-
ing poor.1567 Similarly, a state welfare assistance formula that, af-
ter calculation of individual need, provided less of the determined
amount to families with dependent children than to those persons
in the aged and infirm categories did not violate equal protection
because a state could reasonably believe that the aged and infirm
are the least able to bear the hardships of an inadequate standard
of living, and that the apportionment of limited funds was there-
fore rational.1568 Although reiterating that this standard of review
is “not a toothless one,” the Court has nonetheless sustained a va-
riety of distinctions on the basis that Congress could rationally have
believed them justified,1569 acting to invalidate a provision only once,
and then on the premise that Congress was actuated by an im-
proper purpose.1570
    Similarly, the Court has rejected the contention that access to
housing, despite its great importance, is of any fundamental inter-
est that would place a bar upon the legislature’s giving landlords a
much more favorable and summary process of judicially controlled
eviction actions than was available in other kinds of litigation.1571
    However, a statute that prohibited the dispensing of contracep-
tive devices to single persons for birth control but not for disease
prevention purposes and that contained no limitation on dispensa-
tion to married persons was held to violate the Equal Protection

404 U.S. 78 (1971) (sustaining Social Security provision reducing disability benefits
by amount received from worker’s compensation but not that received from private
insurance).
     1569 E.g., Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U.S. 181 (1976) (provision giving benefits

to married woman under 62 with dependent children in her care whose husband
retires or becomes disabled but denying benefits to divorced woman under 62 with
dependents represents rational judgment with respect to likely dependency of mar-
ried but not divorced women); Califano v. Boles, 443 U.S. 282 (1979) (limitation of
benefits to widows and divorced wives of wage earners does not deny equal protec-
tion to mother of illegitimate child of wage earner who was never married to wage
earner).

rationality).
     1571 Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972). The Court did invalidate one provi-

sion of the law requiring tenants against whom an eviction judgment had been en-
tered after a trial to post a bond in double the amount of rent to become due by the
determination of the appeal, because it bore no reasonable relationship to any valid
state objective and arbitrarily distinguished between defendants in eviction actions
and defendants in other actions. Id. at 74–79.
