counts, [and that] [i]f the total effect of the rate order cannot be
said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act
is at an end,” the Court, in effect, abdicated from the position as-
sumed in the Ben Avon case.187 Without surrendering the judicial
power to declare rates unconstitutional on the basis of a substan-
tive deprivation of due process,188 the Court announced that it would
not overturn a result it deemed to be just simply because “the method
employed [by a commission] to reach that result may contain infir-
mities. . . . [A] Commission’s order does not become suspect by rea-
son of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judg-
ment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would
upset the rate order . . . carries the heavy burden of making a con-
vincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreason-
able in its consequences.” 189
    In dispensing with the necessity of observing the old formulas
for rate computation, the Court did not articulate any substitute
guidance for ascertaining whether a so-called end result is unrea-
sonable. It did intimate that rate-making “involves a balancing of
the investor and consumer interests,” which does not, however, “ ‘in-
sure that the business shall produce net revenues.’ . . . From the
investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough

    188  In FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 599 (1942), Justices Black,
Douglas, and Murphy, in a concurring opinion, proposed to travel the road all the
way back to Munn v. Illinois, and deprive courts of the power to void rates simply
because they deem the latter to be unreasonable. In a concurring opinion, in Driscoll
v. Edison Co., 307 U.S. 104, 122 (1939), Justice Frankfurter temporarily adopted a
similar position; he declared that “[t]he only relevant function of law [in rate contro-
versies] . . . is to secure observance of those procedural safeguards in the exercise
of legislative powers which are the historic foundations of due process.” However, in
his dissent in FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 625 (1944), he disassoci-
ated himself from this proposal, and asserted that “it was decided more than fifty
years ago that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not
the legislature. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U.S. 418 [1890].”

v. FPC, 373 U.S. 294, 299, 317, 326 (1963), in which the Court tentatively approved
an “area rate approach,” that is “the determination of fair prices for gas, based on
reasonable financial requirements of the industry, for . . . the various producing ar-
eas of the country,” and with rates being established on an area basis rather than
on an individual company basis. Four dissenters, Justices Clark, Black, Brennan,
and Chief Justice Warren, labeled area pricing a “wild goose chase,” and stated that
the Commission had acted in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner entirely out-
side traditional concepts of administrative due process. Area rates were approved in
Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747 (1968).
     The Court reaffirmed Hope Natural Gas’s emphasis on the bottom line: “The
Constitution within broad limits leaves the States free to decide what ratesetting

public.” Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch, 488 U.S. 299, 316 (1989) (rejecting takings
