of contaminated foods or drugs or other such commodities to pro-
tect the consumer,845 collection of governmental revenues,846 and the
seizure of enemy property in wartime.847 Thus, citing national secu-
rity interests, the Court upheld an order, issued without notice and
an opportunity to be heard, excluding a short-order cook employed
by a concessionaire from a Naval Gun Factory, but the basis of the
five-to-four decision is unclear.848 On the one hand, the Court was
ambivalent about a right-privilege distinction; 849 on the other hand,
it contrasted the limited interest of the cook—barred from the base,
she was still free to work at a number of the concessionaire’s other
premises—with the government’s interest in conducting a high-
security program.850

Jurisdiction
    Generally.—Jurisdiction may be defined as the power of a gov-
ernment to create legal interests, and the Court has long held that
the Due Process Clause limits the abilities of states to exercise this
power.851 In the famous case of Pennoyer v. Neff,852 the Court enun-
ciated two principles of jurisdiction respecting the states in a fed-
eral system 853: first, “every State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and
sovereignty over persons and property within its territory,” and sec-
ond, “no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over
persons or property without its territory.” 854 Over a long period of

     849 367 U.S. at 894, 895, 896 (1961).
     850 367 U.S. at 896–98. See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 263 n.10 (1970);

Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 575 (1972); Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S.
134, 152 (1974) (plurality opinion), and 416 U.S. at 181–183 (Justice White concur-
ring in part and dissenting in part).

     853 Although these two principles were drawn from the writings of Joseph Story

refining the theories of continental jurists, Hazard, A General Theory of State-Court
Jurisdiction, 1965 SUP. CT. REV. 241, 252–62, the constitutional basis for them was
deemed to be in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pennoyer v.
Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 733–35 (1878). The Due Process Clause and the remainder of the
Fourteenth Amendment had not been ratified at the time of the entry of the state-
court judgment giving rise to the case. This inconvenient fact does not detract from
the subsequent settled use of this constitutional foundation. Pennoyer denied full
faith and credit to the judgment because the state lacked jurisdiction.
     854 95 U.S. at 722. The basis for the territorial concept of jurisdiction promul-

gated in Pennoyer and modified over the years is two-fold: a concern for “fair play
and substantial justice” involved in requiring defendants to litigate cases against
them far from their “home” or place of business. International Shoe Co. v. Washing-
ton, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 317 (1945); Travelers Health Ass’n v. Virginia ex rel. State
