relief to outlaw discrimination in jury selection, instead of depend-
ing on defendants to raise the issue.1666
    A prima facie case of deliberate and systematic exclusion is made
when it is shown that no African-Americans have served on juries
for a period of years 1667 or when it is shown that the number of
African-Americans who served was grossly disproportionate to the
percentage of African-Americans in the population and eligible for
jury service.1668 Once this prima facie showing has been made, the
burden is upon the jurisdiction to prove that it had not practiced
discrimination; it is not adequate that jury selection officials testify
under oath that they did not discriminate.1669 Although the Court
in connection with a showing of great disparities in the racial makeup
of jurors called has voided certain practices that made discrimina-
tion easy to accomplish,1670 it has not outlawed discretionary selec-
tion pursuant to general standards of educational attainment and
character that can be administered fairly.1671 Similarly, it declined
to rule that African-Americans must be included on all-white jury
commissions that administer the jury selection laws in some states.1672
    In Swain v. Alabama, 1673 African-Americans regularly ap-
peared on jury venires but no African-American had actually served
on a jury. It appeared that the absence was attributable to the ac-
tion of the prosecutor in peremptorily challenging all potential African-
American jurors, but the Court refused to set aside the conviction.
The use of peremptory challenges to exclude the African-Americans
in the particular case was permissible, the Court held, regardless
of the prosecutor’s motive, although it indicated that the consistent
use of such challenges to remove African-Americans would be un-
constitutional. Because the record did not disclose that the prosecu-
tion was responsible solely for the fact that no African-American
