    (3) Impartial Tribunal. Just as in criminal and quasi-criminal
cases,729 an impartial decisionmaker is an essential right in civil
proceedings as well.730 “The neutrality requirement helps to guar-
antee that life, liberty, or property will not be taken on the basis of
an erroneous or distorted conception of the facts or the law. . . . At
the same time, it preserves both the appearance and reality of fair-
ness . . . by ensuring that no person will be deprived of his inter-
ests in the absence of a proceeding in which he may present his
case with assurance that the arbiter is not predisposed to find against
him.” 731 Thus, a showing of bias or of strong implications of bias
was deemed made where a state optometry board, made up of only
private practitioners, was proceeding against other licensed optom-
etrists for unprofessional conduct because they were employed by
corporations. Since success in the board’s effort would redound to
the personal benefit of private practitioners, the Court thought the
interest of the board members to be sufficient to disqualify them.732
     There is, however, a “presumption of honesty and integrity in
those serving as adjudicators,” 733 so that the burden is on the ob-
jecting party to show a conflict of interest or some other specific
reason for disqualification of a specific officer or for disapproval of
the system. Thus, combining functions within an agency, such as
by allowing members of a State Medical Examining Board to both
investigate and adjudicate a physician’s suspension, may raise sub-
stantial concerns, but does not by itself establish a violation of due
process.734 The Court has also held that the official or personal stake
that school board members had in a decision to fire teachers who
had engaged in a strike against the school system in violation of

     732 Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973). Or, the conduct of deportation hear-

ings by a person who, while he had not investigated the case heard, was also an
investigator who must judge the results of others’ investigations just as one of them
would some day judge his, raised a substantial problem which was resolved through
statutory construction). Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33 (1950).
     733 Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U.S. 188, 195 (1982); Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S.

     734 Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35 (1975). Where an administrative officer is

acting in a prosecutorial, rather than judicial or quasi-judicial role, an even lesser
standard of impartiality applies. Marshall v. Jerrico, 446 U.S. 238, 248–50 (1980)
(regional administrator assessing fines for child labor violations, with penalties go-
ing into fund to reimburse cost of system of enforcing child labor laws). But “tradi-
tions of prosecutorial discretion do not immunize from judicial scrutiny cases in which
enforcement decisions of an administrator were motivated by improper factors or
were otherwise contrary to law.” Id. at 249.
