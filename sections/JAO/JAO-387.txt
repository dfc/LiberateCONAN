Court held that the high filing fees were not rationally related to
the state’s interest in allowing only serious candidates on the bal-
lot because some serious candidates could not pay the fees whereas
some frivolous candidates could and that the state could not fi-
nance the costs of holding the elections from the fees when the vot-
ers were thereby deprived of their opportunity to vote for candi-
dates of their preferences.
    Extending Bullock, the Court held it impermissible for a state
to deny indigents, and presumably other persons unable to pay fil-
ing fees, a place on the ballot for failure to pay filing fees, however
reasonable in the abstract the fees may be. A state must provide
such persons a reasonable alternative for getting on the ballot.2038
Similarly, a sentencing court in revoking probation must consider
alternatives to incarceration if the reason for revocation is the in-
ability of the indigent to pay a fine or restitution.2039
    In Crawford v. Marion County Election Board,2040 however, a
Court plurality held that a state may require citizens to present a
government-issued photo identification in order to vote. Although
Justice Stevens’ plurality opinion acknowledged “the burden im-
posed on voters who cannot afford . . . a birth certificate” (but added
that it was “not possible to quantify . . . the magnitude of the bur-
den on this narrow class of voters”), it noted that the state had not
“required voters to pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new photo identi-
fication,” and that “the photo-identification cards issued by Indi-
ana’s BMV are also free.” 2041 Justice Stevens also noted that a bur-
den on voting rights, “[h]owever slight . . . must be justified by relevant
and legitimate state interests ‘sufficiently weighty to justify the limi-
tation,’ ” 2042 and he found three state interests that were suffi-
ciently weighty: election modernization (i.e., complying with fed-
eral statutes that require or permit the use of state motor vehicle
driver’s license applications to serve various purposes connected with
voter registration), deterring and detecting voter fraud, and safe-
guarding voter confidence. Justice Stevens’ opinion, therefore, re-
jected a facial challenge to the statute,2043 finding that, even though
it was “fair to infer that partisan considerations may have played
