     Another reason that “privacy” is difficult to define is that the
right appears to arise from multiple sources. For instance, the Court
first identified issues regarding informational privacy as specifi-
cally tied to various provisions of Bill of Rights, including the First
and Fourth Amendments. In Griswold v. Connecticut,624 however,
Justice Douglas found an independent right of privacy in the “pen-
umbras” of these and other constitutional provisions. Although the
parameters and limits of the right to privacy were not well delin-
eated by that decision, which struck down a statute banning mar-
ried couples from using contraceptives, the right appeared to be based
on the notion that the government should not be allowed to gather
information about private, personal activities.625 However, years later,
when the closely related abortion cases were decided, the right to
privacy being discussed was now characterized as a “liberty inter-
est” protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment,626 and the basis for the right identified was more consistent
with a concern for personal autonomy.
    After Griswold, the Court had several opportunities to address
and expand on the concept of Fourteenth Amendment informa-
tional privacy, but instead it returned to Fourth and Fifth Amend-
ment principles to address official regulation of personal informa-
tion.627 For example, in United States v. Miller,628 the Court, in
evaluating the right of privacy of depositors to restrict government
access to cancelled checks maintained by the bank, relied on whether
there was an expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amend-




    624  381 U.S. 479 (1965).
    625  The predominant concern flowing through the several opinions in Griswold
v. Connecticut is the threat of forced disclosure about the private and intimate lives
of persons through the pervasive surveillance and investigative efforts that would
be needed to enforce such a law; moreover, the concern was not limited to the pres-
sures such investigative techniques would impose on the confines of the Fourth Amend-
ment’s search and seizure clause, but also included techniques that would have been
within the range of permissible investigation.

basis of the decisions. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 209, 212 n.4 (1973) (concurring).
