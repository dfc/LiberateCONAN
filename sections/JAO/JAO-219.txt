    In United States v. Grayson,1167 a noncapital case, the Court re-
lied heavily on Williams in holding that a sentencing judge may
properly consider his belief that the defendant was untruthful in
his trial testimony in deciding to impose a more severe sentence
than he would otherwise have imposed. the Court declared that,
under the current scheme of individualized indeterminate sentenc-
ing, the judge must be free to consider the broadest range of infor-
mation in assessing the defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation; de-
fendant’s truthfulness, as assessed by the trial judge from his own
observations, is relevant information.1168
     There are various sentencing proceedings, however, that so im-
plicate substantial rights that additional procedural protections are
required.1169 Thus, in Specht v. Patterson,1170 the Court considered
a defendant who had been convicted of taking indecent liberties,
which carried a maximum sentence of ten years, but was sen-
tenced under a sex offenders statute to an indefinite term of one
day to life. The sex offenders law, the Court observed, did not make
the commission of the particular offense the basis for sentencing.
Instead, by triggering a new hearing to determine whether the con-
victed person was a public threat, a habitual offender, or mentally
ill, the law in effect constituted a new charge that must be accom-
panied by procedural safeguards. And in Mempa v. Rhay,1171 the
Court held that, when sentencing is deferred subject to probation
and the terms of probation are allegedly violated so that the con-
victed defendant is returned for sentencing, he must then be repre-
sented by counsel, inasmuch as it is a point in the process where
substantial rights of the defendant may be affected.

thought the result was compelled by due process, id. at 364, while Justices White
and Blackmun thought the result was necessitated by the Eighth Amendment, id.
at 362, 364, as did Justice Marshall in a different manner. Id. at 365. Chief Justice
Burger concurred only in the result, id. at 362, and Justice Rehnquist dissented. Id.
at 371. See also Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110 (1991) (due process denied where
judge sentenced defendant to death after judge’s and prosecutor’s actions misled de-
fendant and counsel into believing that death penalty would not be at issue in sen-
tencing hearing).

     1168 438 U.S. at 49–52. See also United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446 (1972);

Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 32 (1973). Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 3577.
     1169 See, e.g,Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 554, 561, 563 (1966), where

the Court required that before a juvenile court decided to waive jurisdiction and
transfer a juvenile to an adult court it must hold a hearing and permit defense coun-
sel to examine the probation officer’s report which formed the basis for the court’s
decision. Kent was ambiguous whether it was based on statutory interpretation or
constitutional analysis. In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), however, appears to have
constitutionalized the language.
