The Right to Travel
     The doctrine of the “right to travel” actually encompasses three
separate rights, of which two have been notable for the uncertainty
of their textual support. The first is the right of a citizen to move
freely between states, a right venerable for its longevity, but still
lacking a clear doctrinal basis.1971 The second, expressly addressed
by the first sentence of Article IV, provides a citizen of one state
who is temporarily visiting another state the “Privileges and Immu-
nities” of a citizen of the latter state.1972 The third is the right of a
new arrival to a state, who establishes citizenship in that state, to
enjoy the same rights and benefits as other state citizens. This right
is most often invoked in challenges to durational residency require-
ments, which require that persons reside in a state for a specified
period of time before taking advantage of the benefits of that state’s
citizenship.
     Durational Residency Requirements.—Challenges to durational
residency requirements have traditionally been made under the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1999, how-
ever, the Court approved a doctrinal shift, so that state laws that
distinguished between their own citizens, based on how long they
had been in the state, would be evaluated instead under the Privi-
leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.1973 The
Court did not, however, question the continuing efficacy of the ear-
lier cases.
     A durational residency requirement creates two classes of per-
sons: those who have been within the state for the prescribed pe-
riod and those who have not.1974 But persons who have moved re-
cently, at least from state to state,1975 have exercised a right protected
by the Constitution, and the durational residency classification ei-
     1971 Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). “For the purposes of this case, we need

not identify the source of [the right to travel] in the text of the Constitution. The
right of ‘free ingress and regress to and from’ neighboring states which was ex-
pressly mentioned in the text of the Article of Confederation, may simply have been
‘conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the stronger Union
the Constitution created.’ ” Id. at 501 (citations omitted).
     1972 Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168 (1869) (“without some provision . . .

removing from citizens of each State the disabilities of alienage in other States, and
giving them equality of privilege with citizens of those States, the Republic would
have constituted little more than a league of States; it would not have constituted
the Union which now exists.”).

     1974 Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 334 (1972). Because the right to travel is

implicated by state distinctions between residents and nonresidents, the relevant
constitutional provision is the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Article IV, § 2, cl.
1.
     1975 Intrastate travel is protected to the extent that the classification fails to

meet equal protection standards in some respect. Compare Hadnott v. Amos, 320 F.
