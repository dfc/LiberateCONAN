either expressly or impliedly imposes the affirmative duty of render-
ing a public service demanded by any member of the public. Such
are the railroads, other common carriers and public utilities. (2) Cer-
tain occupations, regarded as exceptional, the public interest attach-
ing to which, recognized from earliest times, has survived the pe-
riod of arbitrary laws by Parliament or Colonial legislatures for
regulating all trades and callings. Such are those of the keepers of
inns, cabs and grist mills. (3) Businesses which though not public
at their inception may be fairly said to have risen to be such and
have become subject in consequence to some government regula-
tion. They have come to hold such a peculiar relation to the public
that this is superimposed upon them. In the language of the cases,
the owner by devoting his business to the public use, in effect grants
the public an interest in that use and subjects himself to public
regulation to the extent of that interest although the property con-
tinues to belong to its private owner and to be entitled to protec-
tion accordingly.”
    Through application of this formula, the Court sustained state
laws regulating charges made by grain elevators,143 stockyards,144
and tobacco warehouses,145 as well as fire insurance rates 146 and
commissions paid to fire insurance agents.147 The Court also voided
statutes regulating business not “affected with a public interest,”
including state statutes fixing the price at which gasoline may be
sold,148 regulating the prices for which ticket brokers may resell the-
ater tickets,149 and limiting competition in the manufacture and sale
of ice through the withholding of licenses to engage in such busi-
ness.150
    In the 1934 case of Nebbia v. New York,151 however, the Court
finally shelved the concept of “a business affected with a public in-
terest,” 152 upholding, by a vote of five-to-four, a depression-induced

    152 In reaching this conclusion the Court might be said to have elevated to the

status of prevailing doctrine the views advanced in previous decisions by dissenting
Justices. Thus, Justice Stone, dissenting in Ribnik v. McBride, 277 U.S. 350, 359–60
(1928), had declared: “Price regulation is within the State’s power whenever any com-
bination of circumstances seriously curtails the regulative force of competition so
