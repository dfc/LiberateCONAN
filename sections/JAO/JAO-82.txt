would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property valued as

    Intangible Personalty.—To determine whether a state may tax
intangible personal property, the Court has applied the fiction mobilia
sequuntur personam (movable property follows the person) and has
also recognized that such property may acquire, for tax purposes, a
permanent business or commercial situs. The Court, however, has
never clearly disposed of the issue whether multiple personal prop-
erty taxation of intangibles is consistent with due process. In the
case of corporate stock, however, the Court has obliquely acknowl-
edged that the owner thereof may be taxed at his own domicile, at
the commercial situs of the issuing corporation, and at the latter’s
domicile. Constitutional lawyers speculated whether the Court would
sustain a tax by all three jurisdictions, or by only two of them. If
the latter, the question would be which two—the state of the com-
mercial situs and of the issuing corporation’s domicile, or the state
of the owner’s domicile and that of the commercial situs.429
     Thus far, the Court has sustained the following personal prop-
erty taxes on intangibles: (1) a debt held by a resident against a
nonresident, evidenced by a bond of the debtor and secured by a
mortgage on real estate in the state of the debtor’s residence; 430
(2) a mortgage owned and kept outside the state by a nonresident
but on land within the state; 431 (3) investments, in the form of loans
to a resident, made by a resident agent of a nonresident credi-
tor; 432 (4) deposits of a resident in a bank in another state, where
he carries on a business and from which these deposits are de-
rived, but belonging absolutely to him and not used in the business
; 433 (5) membership owned by a nonresident in a domestic ex-
change, known as a chamber of commerce; 434 (6) membership by a

revenues derived from local operations, the fact that the apportionment formula does
not result in mathematical exactitude is not a constitutional defect. Illinois Cent.
