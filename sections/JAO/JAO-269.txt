disapproved in Davis, but the Court noted that “an invidious dis-
criminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the
relevant facts, including the fact, if it be true, that the law bears
more heavily on one race than another. It is also not infrequently
true that the discriminatory impact . . . may for all practical pur-
poses demonstrate unconstitutionality because in various circum-
stances the discrimination is very difficult to explain on nonracial
grounds.” 1444
     The application of Davis in the following Terms led to both elu-
cidation and not a little confusion. Looking to a challenged zoning
decision of a local board that had a harsher impact upon blacks
and low-income persons than upon others, the Court in Village of
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.1445 explained
in some detail how inquiry into motivation would work. First, a plain-
tiff is not required to prove that an action rested solely on discrimi-
natory purpose; establishing “a discriminatory purpose” among per-
missible purposes shifts the burden to the defendant to show that
the same decision would have resulted absent the impermissible mo-
tive.1446 Second, determining whether a discriminatory purpose was
a motivating factor “demands a sensitive inquiry into such circum-
stantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” Impact
provides a starting point and “[s]ometimes a clear pattern, unex-
plainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the effect of
Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Indep. School Dist. 467 F.2d 142, 148–50 (5th Cir. 1972)
(en banc), cert. denied, 413 U.S. 920 (1973), the court held that motive and purpose
were irrelevant and the “de facto and de jure nomenclature” to be “meaningless.”
After the distinction was reiterated in Keyes v. Denver School District, 413 U.S. 189
(1973), the Fifth Circuit adopted the position that a decisionmaker must be pre-
sumed to have intended the probable, natural, or foreseeable consequences of his
decision and therefore that a school board decision that results in segregation is
intentional in the constitutional sense, regardless of its motivation. United States v.
Texas Educ. Agency, 532 F.2d 380 (5th Cir.), vacated and remanded for reconsidera-
tion in light of Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), modified and adhered to,
564 F.2d 162, reh. denied, 579 F.2d 910 (5th Cir. 1977–78), cert denied, 443 U.S. 915
(1979). See also United States v. Texas Educ. Agency, 600 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1979).
This form of analysis was, however, substantially cabined in Massachusetts Person-
nel Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 278–80 (1979), although foreseeability as one
kind of proof was acknowledged by Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449,
464–65 (1979).
    1444 Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. at 242 (1976).
    1445 429 U.S. 252 (1977).
    1446 429 U.S. at 265–66, 270 n.21. See also Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v.

Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 284–87 (1977) (once plaintiff shows defendant acted from im-
permissible motive in not rehiring him, burden shifts to defendant to show result
would have been same in the absence of that motive; constitutional violation not
established merely by showing of wrongful motive); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S.
222 (1985) (circumstances of enactment made it clear that state constitutional amend-
ment requiring disenfranchisement for crimes involving moral turpitude had been
adopted for purpose of racial discrimination, even though it was realized that some
poor whites would also be disenfranchised thereby).
