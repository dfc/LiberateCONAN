sonably asked.499 Nor is there any constitutional command that no-
tice of an assessment as well as an opportunity to contest it be given
in advance of the assessment. It is enough that all available de-
fenses may be presented to a competent tribunal during a suit to
collect the tax and before the demand of the state for remittance
becomes final.500
     However, when assessments based on the enjoyment of a spe-
cial benefit are made by a political subdivision, a taxing board or
court, the property owner is entitled to be heard as to the amount
of his assessments and upon all questions properly entering into
that determination.501 The hearing need not amount to a judicial
inquiry,502 although a mere opportunity to submit objections in writ-
ing, without the right of personal appearance, is not sufficient.503
Generally, if an assessment for a local improvement is made in ac-
cordance with a fixed rule prescribed by legislative act, the prop-
erty owner is not entitled to be heard in advance on the question
of benefits.504 On the other hand, if the area of the assessment dis-
trict was not determined by the legislature, a landowner does have
the right to be heard respecting benefits to his property before it
can be included in the improvement district and assessed, but due
process is not denied if, in the absence of actual fraud or bad faith,
the decision of the agency vested with the initial determination of
benefits is made final.505 The owner has no constitutional right to
be heard in opposition to the launching of a project which may end
in assessment, and once his land has been duly included within a

submit evidence and arguments being all that can be adjudged vital, it follows that
rehearings and new trials are not essential to due process of law. Pittsburgh C.C. &

process, Michigan Central R.R. v. Powers, 201 U.S. 245, 302 (1906), and the require-
ments of due process are also met if a taxpayer, who had no notice of a hearing,
does receive notice of the decision reached there and is privileged to appeal it and,
on appeal, to present evidence and be heard on the valuation of his property. Pitts-
