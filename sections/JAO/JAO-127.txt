the Court has already concluded that it is valid to extend an exist-
ing precedent of the privacy line of cases. Because much of this pro-
tection is also now settled to be a “liberty” protected under the due
process clauses, however, the analytical significance of denominat-
ing the particular right or interest as an element of privacy seems
open to question.
     Family Relationships.—Unlike the shifting definitions of the
“privacy” line of case, the Court’s treatment of the “liberty” of famil-
ial relationships has a relatively principled doctrinal basis. Start-
ing with Meyer and Pierce,668 the Court has held that “the Consti-
tution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the
institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.” 669 For instance, the right to marry is a fundamen-
tal right protected by the Due Process Clause,670 and only “reason-
able regulations” of marriage may be imposed.671 Thus, the Court
has held that a state may not deny the right to marry to someone
who has failed to meet a child support obligation, as the state al-
ready has numerous other means for exacting compliance with sup-
port obligations.672 In fact, any regulation that affects the ability to
form, maintain, dissolve, or resolve conflicts within a family is sub-
ject to rigorous judicial scrutiny.
     There is also a constitutional right to live together as a fam-
ily,673 and this right is not limited to the nuclear family. Thus, a
neighborhood that is zoned for single-family occupancy, and that de-
fines “family” so as to prevent a grandmother from caring for two
grandchildren of different children, was found to violate the Due
     668 Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.

510 (1928).
     669 Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality). Unlike

the liberty interest in property, which derives from early statutory law, these liber-
ties spring instead from natural law traditions, as they are “intrinsic human rights.”
Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 845 (1977). These rights,
however, do not extend to all close relationships. Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186
(1986) (same sex relationships).
     670 Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.

Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383–87 (1978).
     671 Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 386 (1978).
     672 Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978). The majority of the Court deemed

the statute to fail under equal protection, whereas Justices Stewart and Powell found
a violation of due process. Id. at 391, 396. Compare Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47
(1977).
     673 “If a State were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family, over the

objections of the parents and their children, without some showing of unfitness and
for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children’s best interest, I
should have little doubt that the State would have intruded impermissibly on ‘the
private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.’ ” Smith v. Organization of
Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 862–63 (1977) (Justice Stewart concurring), cited with
approval in Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978).
