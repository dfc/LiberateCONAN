ing toward the date of eligibility for parole, does not deny the pris-
oners incarcerated in local jails equal protection. The distinction is
rationally justified by the fact that good-time credit is designed to
encourage prisoners to engage in rehabilitation courses and activi-
ties that exist only in state prisons and not in local jails.1580
    The Equal Protection Clause does, however, render invalid a stat-
ute requiring the sterilization of persons convicted of various of-
fenses when the statute draws a line between like offenses, such as
between larceny by fraud and embezzlement.1581 A statute that pro-
vided that convicted defendants sentenced to imprisonment must
reimburse the state for the furnishing of free transcripts of their
trial by having amounts deducted from prison pay denied such per-
sons equal protection when it did not require reimbursement of those
fined, given suspended sentences, or placed on probation.1582 Simi-
larly, a statute enabling the state to recover the costs of such tran-
scripts and other legal defense fees by a civil action violated equal
protection because indigent defendants against whom judgment was
entered under the statute did not have the benefit of exemptions
and benefits afforded other civil judgment debtors.1583 But a bail
reform statute that provided for liberalized forms of release and that
imposed the costs of operating the system upon one category of re-
leased defendants, generally those most indigent, was not invalid
because the classification was rational and because the measure was
in any event a substantial improvement upon the old bail sys-
tem.1584 The Court has applied the clause strictly to prohibit numer-
ous de jure and de facto distinctions based on wealth or indigency.1585

                   EQUAL PROTECTION AND RACE

Overview
    The Fourteenth Amendment “is one of a series of constitutional
provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing to a race re-
cently emancipated, a race that through many generations had been
held in slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy. The
true spirit and meaning of the amendments . . . cannot be under-

tance upon convicted defendants but not upon those acquitted or whose convictions
are reversed is objectively rational).
