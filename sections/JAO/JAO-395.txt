                     DISQUALIFICATION AND PUBLIC DEBT
            The right to remove disabilities imposed by this section was ex-
        ercised by Congress at different times on behalf of enumerated in-
        dividuals.2069 In 1872, the disabilities were removed, by a blanket
        act, from all persons “except Senators and Representatives of the
        Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses, officers in the judicial,
        military and naval service of the United States, heads of depart-
        ments, and foreign ministers of the United States.” 2070 Twenty-six
        years later, Congress enacted that “the disability imposed by sec-
        tion 3 . . . incurred heretofore, is hereby removed.” 2071
            Although § 4 “was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put be-
        yond question the obligations of the government issued during the
        Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation. . . . ‘[T]he
        validity of the public debt’ . . . [embraces] whatever concerns the
        integrity of the public obligations,” and applies to government bonds
        issued after as well as before adoption of the Amendment.2072

    SECTION 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by ap-
propriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

        Generally
            In the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress, in addition to pro-
        posing to the states the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amend-
        ments, enacted seven statutes designed in a variety of ways to imple-
        ment the provisions of these Amendments.2073 Several of these laws
            2069  E.g., and notably, the Private Act of December 14, 1869, ch.1, 16 Stat. 607.
            2070  Ch. 193, 17 Stat. 142.
             2071 Act of June 6, 1898, ch. 389, 30 Stat. 432. Legislation by Congress provid-

        ing for removal was necessary to give effect to the prohibition of § 3, and until re-
        moved in pursuance of such legislation persons in office before promulgation of the
        Fourteenth Amendment continued to exercise their functions lawfully. Griffin’s Case,
        11 Fed. Cas. 7 (C.C.D.Va. 1869) (No. 5815). Nor were persons who had taken part
        in the Civil War and had been pardoned by the President before the adoption of
        this Amendment precluded by this section from again holding office under the United
        States. 18 Op. Att’y Gen. 149 (1885). On the construction of “engaged in rebellion,”
        see United States v. Powell, 27 Fed. Cas. 605 (C.C.D.N.C. 1871) (No. 16,079).
             2072 Perry v. United States, 294 U.S. 330, 354 (1935), in which the Court con-

        cluded that the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, insofar as it attempted to override
        the gold-clause obligation in a Fourth Liberty Loan Gold Bond “went beyond the
        congressional power.” On a Confederate bond problem, see Branch v. Haas, 16 F. 53
        (C.C.M.D. Ala. 1883) (citing Hanauer v. Woodruff, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 439 (1873), and
        Thorington v. Smith, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 1 (1869)). See also The Pietro Campanella, 73
