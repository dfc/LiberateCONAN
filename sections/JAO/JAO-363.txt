“legislative” or “administrative” or necessarily important or unim-
portant; it is the fact that members of the body are elected from
districts that triggers the application.1916
    The second issue has been largely but not precisely resolved.
In Swann v. Adams,1917 the Court set aside a lower court ruling
“for the failure of the State to present or the District Court to ar-
ticulate acceptable reasons for the variations among the popula-
tions of the various legislative districts. . . . De minimis deviations
are unavoidable, but variations of 30% among senate districts and
40% among house districts can hardly be deemed de minimis and
none of our cases suggests that differences of this magnitude will
be approved without a satisfactory explanation grounded on accept-
able state policy.” Two congressional districting cases were dis-
posed of on the basis of Swann,1918 but, although the Court ruled
that no congressional districting could be approved without “a good-
faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality” or the justifi-
cation of “each variance, no matter how small,” 1919 it did not apply
this strict standard to state legislative redistricting.1920 And, in Abate
v. Mundt,1921 the Court approved a plan for apportioning a county
governing body that permitted a substantial population disparity,
explaining that in the absence of a built-in bias tending to favor
any particular area or interest, a plan could take account of local-
ized factors in justifying deviations from equality that might in other

      1916 The Court observed that there might be instances “in which a State elects

certain functionaries whose duties are so far removed from normal governmental
activities and so disproportionately affect different groups that a popular election in
compliance with Reynolds, supra, might not be required . . . .” 397 U.S. at 56. For

U.S. 719 (1973); Associated Enterprises v. Toltec Watershed Imp. Dist., 410 U.S. 743
(1973); Ball v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981). Judicial districts need not comply with
Reynolds. Wells v. Edwards, 347 F. Supp. 453 (M.D. La. 1972) (three-judge court),

394 U.S. 542 (1969). The Court has continued to adhere to this strict standard for
congressional districting, voiding a plan in which the maximum deviation between
largest and smallest district was 0.7%, or 3,674 persons. Karcher v. Daggett, 462
U.S. 725 (1983) (rejecting assertion that deviations less than estimated census error
are necessarily permissible).
      1920 The Court relied on Swann in disapproving of only slightly smaller devia-

tions (roughly 28% and 25%) in Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 161–63 (1971).
In Connor v. Williams, 404 U.S. 549, 550 (1972), the Court said of plaintiffs’ reliance
on Preisler and Wells that “these decisions do not squarely control the instant ap-
peal since they do not concern state legislative apportionment, but they do raise
substantial questions concerning the constitutionality of the District Court’s plan as
a design for permanent apportionment.”
