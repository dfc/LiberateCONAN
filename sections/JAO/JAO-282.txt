inequality.1526 A special highway assessment against railroads based
on real property, rolling stock, and other personal property is un-
justly discriminatory when other assessments for the same improve-
ment are based on real property alone.1527 A law requiring the fran-
chise of a railroad to be considered in valuing its property for
apportionment of a special assessment is not invalid where the fran-
chises were not added as a separate personal property value to the
assessment of the real property.1528 In taxing railroads within a le-
vee district on a mileage basis, it is not necessarily arbitrary to fix
a lower rate per mile for those having fewer than 25 miles of main
line within the district than for those having more.1529

Police Power Regulation
    Classification.—Justice Holmes’ characterization of the Equal
Protection Clause as the “usual last refuge of constitutional argu-
ments” 1530 was no doubt made with the practice in mind of contes-
tants tacking on an equal protection argument to a due process chal-
lenge of state economic regulation. Few police regulations have been
held unconstitutional on this ground.
     “[T]he Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope
of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens
differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only
if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achieve-
ment of the State’s objective. State legislatures are presumed to have
acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in prac-
tice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimina-
tion will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be
conceived to justify it.” 1531 The Court has made it clear that only
the totally irrational classification in the economic field will be struck
down,1532 and it has held that legislative classifications that im-

that banned all pushcart vendors from the French Quarter, except those in continu-
ous operation for more than eight years, the Court summarized its method of deci-
sion here. “When local economic regulation is challenged solely as violating the Equal
Protection Clause, this Court consistently defers to legislative determinations as to
the desirability of particular statutory discriminations. . . . Unless a classification
trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently suspect distinc-
tions such as race, religion, or alienage, our decisions presume the constitutionality
of the statutory discriminations and require only that the classification challenged
be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. States are accorded wide latitude
