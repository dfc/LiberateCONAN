addresses were unknown to the bank, the Court held that it was
feasible to make serious efforts to notify residents and nonresi-
dents whose whereabouts were known, such as by mailing notice
to the addresses on record with the bank.942
     Notice: Service of Process.—Before a state may legitimately
exercise control over persons and property, the state’s jurisdiction
must be perfected by an appropriate service of process that is effec-
tive to notify all parties of proceedings that may affect their rights.943
Personal service guarantees actual notice of the pendency of a le-
gal action, and has traditionally been deemed necessary in actions
styled in personam.944 But “certain less rigorous notice procedures
have enjoyed substantial acceptance throughout our legal history;
in light of this history and the practical obstacles to providing per-
sonal service in every instance,” the Court in some situations has
allowed the use of procedures that “do not carry with them the same
certainty of actual notice that inheres in personal service.” 945 But,
whether the action be in rem or in personam, there is a constitu-
tional minimum; due process requires “notice reasonably calcu-
lated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of
the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to pres-
ent their objections.” 946

     942 A related question is which state has the authority to escheat a corporate

debt. See Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 368 U.S. 71 (1961); Texas v. New
Jersey, 379 U.S. 674 (1965). Where a state seeks to escheat intangible corporate
property such as uncollected debt, the Court found that the multiplicity of states
with a possible interest made a “contacts” test unworkable. Citing ease of adminis-
tration rather than logic or jurisdiction, the Court held that the authority to take
the uncollected claims against a corporation by escheat would be based on whether
the last known address on the company’s books for the each creditor was in a par-
ticular state.
     943 “An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceed-

ing which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the
circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford
them an opportunity to present their objections.” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank
& Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950). “There . . . must be a basis for the defen-
dant’s amenability to service of summons. Absent consent, this means there must
be authorization for service of summons on the defendant.” Omni Capital Int’l v.
Rudolph Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97 (1987).
     944 McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U.S. 90, 92 (1971).
     945 Greene v. Lindsey, 456 U.S. 444, 449 (1982). See Dusenbery v. United States,

534 U.S. 161 (2001) (upholding a notice of forfeiture that was delivered by certified
mail to the mailroom of a prison where the individual to be served was incarcer-
ated, even though the individual himself did not sign for the letter).

Thus, in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220 (2006), the Court held that, after a state’s
certified letter, intended to notify a property owner that his property would be sold
unless he satisfied a tax delinquency, was returned by the post office marked “un-
claimed,” the state should have taken additional reasonable steps to notify the prop-
erty owner, as it would have been practicable for it to have done so. And, in Greene
v. Lindsey, 456 U.S. 444 (1982), the Court held that, in light of substantial evidence
