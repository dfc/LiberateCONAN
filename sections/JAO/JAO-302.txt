schools. The Supreme Court found this latter holding to be error,
holding that, when it is proved that a significant portion of a sys-
tem is officially segregated, the presumption arises that segrega-
tion in the remainder or other portions of the system is also simi-
larly contrived. The burden then shifts to the school board or other
officials to rebut the presumption by proving, for example, that geo-
graphical structure or natural boundaries have caused the dividing
of a district into separate identifiable and unrelated units. Thus, a
finding that one significant portion of a school system is officially
segregated may well be the predicate for finding that the entire sys-
tem is a dual one, necessitating the imposition upon the school au-
thorities of the affirmative obligation to create a unitary system
throughout.1636
    Keyes then was consistent with earlier cases requiring a show-
ing of official complicity in segregation and limiting the remedy to
the violation found; by creating presumptions Keyes simply af-
forded plaintiffs a way to surmount the barriers imposed by strict
application of the requirements. Following the enunciation in the
Detroit inter-district case, however, of the “controlling principle” of
school desegregation cases, the Court appeared to move away from
the Keyes approach.1637 First, the Court held that federal equity power
was lacking to impose orders to correct demographic shifts “not at-
tributed to any segregative actions on the part of the defen-
dants.” 1638 A district court that had ordered implementation of a
student assignment plan that resulted in a racially neutral system
exceeded its authority, the Court held, by ordering annual readjust-
ments to offset the demographic changes.1639
    Second, in the first Dayton case the lower courts had found three
constitutional violations that had resulted in some pupil segrega-
tion, and, based on these three, viewed as “cumulative violations,”
     1636 413 U.S. at 207–11. Justice Rehnquist argued that imposition of a district-

wide segregation order should not proceed from a finding of segregative intent and
effect in only one portion, that in effect the Court was imposing an affirmative obli-
gation to integrate without first finding a constitutional violation. Id. at 254 (dissent-
ing). Justice Powell cautioned district courts against imposing disruptive desegrega-
tion plans, especially substantial busing in large metropolitan areas, and stressed
the responsibility to proceed with reason, flexibility, and balance. Id. at 217, 236
(concurring and dissenting). See his opinion in Austin Indep. School Dist. v. United
States, 429 U.S. 990, 991 (1976) (concurring).
     1637 Of significance was the disallowance of the disproportionate impact analy-

sis in constitutional interpretation and the adoption of an apparently strengthened
intent requirement. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976); Village of Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977); Massachusetts Per-
sonnel Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979). This principle applies in the school
area. Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 419 (1977).
     1638 Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (1976).
     1639 427 U.S. at 436.
