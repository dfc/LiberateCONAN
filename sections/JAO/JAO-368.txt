     Justice White’s plurality opinion suggested that there need be
“evidence of continued frustration of the will of a majority of the
voters or effective denial to a minority of voters of a fair chance to
influence the political process.” 1940 Moreover, continued frustration
of the chance to influence the political process cannot be demon-
strated by the results of only one election; there must be a history
of disproportionate results or a finding that such results will con-
tinue. Justice Powell, joined by Justice Stevens, did not formulate
a strict test, but suggested that “a heavy burden of proof ” should
be required, and that courts should look to a variety of factors as
they relate to “the fairness of a redistricting plan” in determining
whether it contains invalid gerrymandering. Among these factors
are the shapes of the districts, adherence to established subdivi-
sion lines, statistics relating to vote dilution, the nature of the leg-
islative process by which the plan was formulated, and evidence of
intent revealed in legislative history.1941
     In the following years, however, litigants seeking to apply Da-
vis against alleged partisan gerrymandering were generally unsuc-
cessful. Then, when the Supreme Court revisited the issue in 2004,
it all but closed the door on such challenges. In Vieth v. Jubelirer,1942
a four-Justice plurality would have overturned Davis v. Bandemer’s
holding that challenges to political gerrymandering are justiciable,
but five Justices disagreed. The plurality argued that partisan con-
siderations are an intrinsic part of establishing districts,1943 that
no judicially discernable or manageable standards exist to evaluate
unlawful partisan gerrymandering,1944 and that the power to ad-
dress the issue of political gerrymandering resides in Congress.1945
     Of the five Justices who believed that challenges to political ger-
rymandering are justiciable, four dissented, but Justice Kennedy con-
curred with the four-Justice plurality’s holding, thereby upholding
Pennsylvania’s congressional redistricting plan against a political
gerrymandering challenge. Justice Kennedy agreed that the lack “of
any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation” or “sub-
stantive principles of fairness in districting” left the Court with “no
basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral
standards for measuring the particular burden a given partisan clas-
