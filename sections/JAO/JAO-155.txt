a replevin statute that authorized the seizure of property (here house-
hold goods purchased on an installment contract) simply upon the
filing of an ex parte application and the posting of bond, has been
limited,827 so that an appropriately structured ex parte judicial de-
termination before seizure is sufficient to satisfy due process.828 Thus,
laws authorizing sequestration, garnishment, or other seizure of prop-
erty of an alleged defaulting debtor need only require that (1) the
creditor furnish adequate security to protect the debtor’s interest,
(2) the creditor make a specific factual showing before a neutral of-
ficer or magistrate, not a clerk or other such functionary, of prob-
able cause to believe that he is entitled to the relief requested, and
(3) an opportunity be assured for an adversary hearing promptly
after seizure to determine the merits of the controversy, with the
burden of proof on the creditor.829
    Similarly, applying the Mathews v. Eldridge standard in the con-
text of government employment, the Court has held, albeit by a com-
bination of divergent opinions, that the interest of the employee in
retaining his job, the governmental interest in the expeditious re-
moval of unsatisfactory employees, the avoidance of administrative
     827 Fuentes was an extension of the Sniadach principle to all “significant prop-

erty interests” and thus mandated pre-deprivation hearings. Fuentes was a decision
of uncertain viability from the beginning, inasmuch as it was four-to-three; argu-
ment had been heard prior to the date Justices Powell and Rehnquist joined the
Court, hence neither participated in the decision. See Di-Chem, 419 U.S. at 616–19
(Justice Blackmun dissenting); Mitchell, 416 U.S. at 635–36 (1974) (Justice Stewart
dissenting).
     828 Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600 (1974); North Georgia Finishing v.

Di-Chem, 419 U.S. 601 (1975). More recently, the Court has applied a variant of the
Mathews v. Eldridge formula in holding that Connecticut’s prejudgment attachment
statute, which “fail[ed] to provide a preattachment hearing without at least requir-
ing a showing of some exigent circumstance,” operated to deny equal protection. Con-
necticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 18 (1991). “[T]he relevant inquiry requires, as in Mathews,
first, consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the prejudgment
measure; second, an examination of the risk of erroneous deprivation through the
procedures under attack and the probable value of additional or alternative safe-
guards; and third, in contrast to Mathews, principal attention to the interest of the
party seeking the prejudgment remedy, with, nonetheless, due regard for any ancil-
lary interest the government may have in providing the procedure or forgoing the
added burden of providing greater protections.” 501 U.S. at 11.
     829 Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. at 615–18 (1974) and at 623 (Justice

Powell concurring). See also Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 188 (1974) (Justice
White concurring in part and dissenting in part). Efforts to litigate challenges to
seizures in actions involving two private parties may be thwarted by findings of “no
state action,” but there often is sufficient participation by state officials in transfer-
ring possession of property to constitute state action and implicate due process. Com-
pare Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978) (no state action in warehouseman’s
sale of goods for nonpayment of storage, as authorized by state law), with Lugar v.
Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982) (state officials’ joint participation with pri-
vate party in effecting prejudgment attachment of property); and Tulsa Professional
Collection Servs. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) (probate court was sufficiently in-
volved with actions activating time bar in “nonclaim” statute).
