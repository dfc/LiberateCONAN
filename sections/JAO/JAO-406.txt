crimination. This was a particularly difficult test to meet, as the
Court has generally rejected constitutional challenges to age dis-
crimination by states, finding that there is a rational basis for states
to use age as a proxy for other qualities, abilities and characteris-
tics.2141 Noting the lack of a sufficient legislative record establish-
ing broad and unconstitutional state discrimination based on age,
the Court found that the ADEA, as applied to the states, was “so
out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that
it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent un-
constitutional behavior.” 2142
     Despite what was considered by many to be a better developed
legislative record, the Court in Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.
Garrett 2143 also rejected the recovery of money damages against states,
this time under of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA).2144 Title I of the ADA prohibits employers, including states,
from “discriminating against a qualified individual with a disabil-
ity” 2145 and requires employers to “make reasonable accommoda-
tions [for] . . . physical or mental limitations . . . . unless [to do
so] . . . would impose an undue hardship on the . . . business.” 2146
Although the Court had previously overturned discriminatory legis-
lative classifications based on disability in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne
Living Center,2147 the Court had held that determinations of when
states had violated the Equal Protection Clause in such cases were
to be made under the relatively deferential standard of rational ba-
sis review. Thus, failure of an employer to provide the kind “reason-
able accommodations” required under the ADA would not generally
rise to the level of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and
instances of such failures did not qualify as a “history and pattern
of unconstitutional employment discrimination.” 2148 According the
Court, not only did the legislative history developed by the Con-
gress not establish a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination against
the disabled by states,2149 but the requirements of the ADA would
be out of proportion to the alleged offenses.

test to uphold mandatory retirement age of 70 for state judges).

     2143 531 U.S. 356 (2001).
     2144 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111–12117.
     2145 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).
     2146 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
     2147 473 U.S. 432 (1985).
     2148 531 U.S. at 368.
     2149 As Justice Breyer pointed out in the dissent, however, the Court seemed

determined to accord Congress a degree of deference more commensurate with re-
view of an agency action, discounting portions of the legislative history as based on
secondary source materials, unsupported by evidence and not relevant to the in-
quiry at hand.
