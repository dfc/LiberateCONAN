ute that forbade stock insurance companies to act through agents
who were their salaried employees but permitted mutual compa-

tion of appearing in a Kansas court. Martin v. Walton, 368 U.S. 25 (1961). Two dis-

Policy Act of facilities that serve only dwelling units under common ownership. FCC

sumers, and potential for monopoly power is lessened when a cable system operator
is negotiating with a single-owner.

gins equal protection when there is nothing in the laws to forbid them to distribute
their net earnings among their patrons. Corporation Comm’n v. Lowe, 281 U.S. 431
(1930).
     Debt adjustment business: operation only as incident to legitimate practice of
law. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726 (1963).
