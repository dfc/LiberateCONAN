a vested right in such defenses.963 Similarly, a nonresident defen-
dant in a suit begun by foreign attachment, even though he has no
resources or credit other than the property attached, cannot chal-
lenge the validity of a statute which requires him to give bail or
security for the discharge of the seized property before permitting
him an opportunity to appear and defend.964
    Costs, Damages, and Penalties.—What costs are allowed by
law is for the court to determine; an erroneous judgment of what
the law allows does not deprive a party of his property without due
process of law.965 Nor does a statute providing for the recovery of
reasonable attorney’s fees in actions on small claims subject unsuc-
cessful defendants to any unconstitutional deprivation.966 Congress
may, however, severely restrict attorney’s fees in an effort to keep
an administrative claims proceeding informal.967
    Equally consistent with the requirements of due process is a
statutory procedure whereby a prosecutor of a case is adjudged li-
able for costs, and committed to jail in default of payment thereof,
whenever the court or jury, after according him an opportunity to
present evidence of good faith, finds that he instituted the prosecu-
tion without probable cause and from malicious motives.968 Also, as
a reasonable incentive for prompt settlement without suit of just
demands of a class receiving special legislative treatment, such as
common carriers and insurance companies together with their pa-
trons, a state may permit harassed litigants to recover penalties in
the form of attorney’s fees or damages.969

on acquitted defendant, but containing no standards to guide discretion, violates due
process).
