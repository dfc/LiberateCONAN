the practice.658 The privacy of the home does not protect all behav-
ior from state regulation, and the Court was “unwilling to start down
[the] road” of immunizing “voluntary sexual conduct between con-
senting adults.” 659 Interestingly, Justice Blackmun, in dissent, was
most critical of the Court’s framing of the issue as one of homo-
sexual sodomy, as the sodomy statute at issue was not so lim-
ited.660
    Yet, Lawrence v. Texas,661 by overruling Bowers, brought the outer
limits of noneconomic substantive due process into question by once
again using the language of “privacy” rights. Citing the line of per-
sonal autonomy cases starting with Griswold, the Court found that
sodomy laws directed at homosexuals “seek to control a personal
relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in
the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being pun-
ished as criminals. . . . When sexuality finds overt expression in
intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one
element in a personal bond that is more enduring. The liberty pro-
tected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to
make this choice.” 662

that there was no “fundamental right [of] homosexuals to engage in acts of consen-
sual sodomy,” as homosexual sodomy is neither a fundamental liberty “implicit in
the concept of ordered liberty” nor is it “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and
tradition.” 478 U.S. at 191–92.
     658 478 U.S. at 191–92. Chief Justice Burger’s brief concurring opinion ampli-

fied this theme, concluding that constitutional protection for “the act of homosexual
sodomy . . . would . . . cast aside millennia of moral teaching.” Id. at 197. Justice
Powell cautioned that Eighth Amendment proportionality principles might limit the
severity with which states can punish the practices (Hardwick had been charged
but not prosecuted, and had initiated the action to have the statute under which he
had been charged declared unconstitutional). Id.
     659 The Court voiced concern that “it would be difficult . . . to limit the claimed

right to homosexual conduct while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest,
and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home.” 478 U.S. at
195–96. Dissenting Justices Blackmun (id. at 209 n.4) and Stevens (id. at 217–18)
suggested that these crimes are readily distinguishable.
     660 478 U.S. at 199. The Georgia statute at issue, like most sodomy statutes,

prohibits the practices regardless of the sex or marital status of the participants.
See id. at 188 n.1. Justice Stevens too focused on this aspect, suggesting that the
earlier privacy cases clearly bar a state from prohibiting sodomy by married couples,
and that Georgia had not justified selective application to homosexuals. Id. at 219.
Justice Blackmun would instead have addressed the issue more broadly as to whether
the law violated an individual’s privacy right “to be let alone.” The privacy cases are
not limited to protection of the family and the right to procreation, he asserted, but
instead stand for the broader principle of individual autonomy and choice in mat-
ters of sexual intimacy. 478 U.S. at 204–06. This position was rejected by the major-
ity, however, which held that the thrust of the fundamental right of privacy in this
area is one functionally related to “family, marriage, or procreation.” 478 U.S. at
191. See also Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 713 (1976).
     661 539 U.S. 558 (2003).
