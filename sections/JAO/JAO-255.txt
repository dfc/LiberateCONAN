“These provisions are universal in their application, to all persons
within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences
of race, of color, or of nationality. . . .” 1363 The only qualification is
that a municipal corporation cannot invoke the clause against its
state.1364
    “Within Its Jurisdiction”.—Persons “within its jurisdiction” are
entitled to equal protection from a state. Largely because Article
IV, § 2, has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and im-
munities of citizens in the several states, the Court has rarely con-
strued the phrase in relation to natural persons.1365 As to business
entities, it was first held that a foreign corporation that was not
doing business in a state in a manner that subjected it to the pro-
cess of a state’s courts was not “within the jurisdiction” of the state
and could not complain that resident creditors were given prefer-
ences in the distribution of assets of an insolvent corporation.1366
This holding was subsequently qualified, however, with the Court
holding that a foreign corporation seeking to recover possession of
property wrongfully taken in one state, but suing in another state
in which it was not licensed to do business, was “within the juris-
diction” of the latter state, so that unequal burdens could not be
imposed on the maintenance of the suit.1367 The test of amenability
to service of process within the state was ignored in a later case
dealing with discriminatory assessment of property belonging to a
nonresident individual.1368 On the other hand, if a state has admit-
ted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that cor-
poration is entitled to equal protection of the laws, but not neces-
sarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.1369

las, in Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 576 (1949), have disagreed
that corporations are persons for equal protection purposes.

the phrase in the context of holding that aliens illegally present in a state are “within
its jurisdiction” and may thus raise equal protection claims).
