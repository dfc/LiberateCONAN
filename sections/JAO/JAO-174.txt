company to defend and pay the judgment. But, in Harris v. Balk,923
the facts of the case and the establishment of jurisdiction through
quasi in rem proceedings raised the issue of fairness and territori-
ality. The claimant was a Maryland resident who was owed a debt
by Balk, a North Carolina resident. The Marylander ascertained,
apparently adventitiously, that Harris, a North Carolina resident
who owed Balk an amount of money, was passing through Mary-
land, and the Marylander attached this debt. Balk had no notice of
the action and a default judgment was entered, after which Harris
paid over the judgment to the Marylander. When Balk later sued
Harris in North Carolina to recover on his debt, Harris argued that
he had been relieved of any further obligation by satisfying the judg-
ment in Maryland, and the Supreme Court sustained his defense,
ruling that jurisdiction had been properly obtained and the Mary-
land judgment was thus valid.924
    Subsequently, Harris v. Balk was overruled by Shaffer v. Heitner,925
in which the Court rejected the Delaware state court’s jurisdiction,
holding that the “minimum contacts” test of International Shoe ap-
plied to all in rem and quasi in rem actions. The case involved a
Delaware sequestration statute under which plaintiffs were autho-
rized to bring actions against nonresident defendants by attaching
their “property” within Delaware, the property here consisting of
shares of corporate stock and options to stock in the defendant cor-
poration. The stock was considered to be in Delaware because that
was the state of incorporation, but none of the certificates represent-
ing the seized stocks were physically present in Delaware. The rea-
son for applying the same test as is applied in in personam cases,
the Court said, “is simple and straightforward. It is premised on
recognition that ‘[t]he phrase ‘judicial jurisdiction’ over a thing,’ is
a customary elliptical way of referring to jurisdiction over the inter-
ests of persons in a thing.” 926 Thus, “[t]he recognition leads to the
conclusion that in order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem,
the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising ‘ju-
risdiction over the interests of persons in a thing.’ ” 927

    924 Compare New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, 241 U.S. 518 (1916) (action pur-
portedly against property within state, proceeds of an insurance policy, was really
an in personam action against claimant and, claimant not having been served, the
judgment is void). But see Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 368 U.S. 71 (1961).
    925 433 U.S. 186 (1977).
    926 433 U.S. at 207 (internal quotation from RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF

LAWS 56, Introductory Note (1971)).
    927 433 U.S. at 207. The characterization of actions in rem as being not actions

against a res but against persons with interests merely reflects Justice Holmes’ in-
sight in Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 175 Mass. 71, 76–77, 55 N.E.,
812, 814, appeal dismissed, 179 U.S. 405 (1900).
