or in conventions. Candidates of parties not coming within either
of the first two categories had to be nominated in conventions and
could obtain ballot space only if the notarized list of participants at
the conventions totaled at least one percent of the total votes cast
for governor in the last preceding general election or, failing this, if
in the 55 succeeding days a requisite number of qualified voters
signed petitions to bring the total up to one percent of the guberna-
torial vote. “[W]hat is demanded may not be so excessive or imprac-
tical as to be in reality a mere device to always, or almost always,
exclude parties with significant support from the ballot,” but the
Court thought that one percent, or 22,000 signatures in 1972, “falls
within the outer boundaries of support the State may require.” 1899
Similarly, independent candidates can be required to obtain a cer-
tain number of signatures as a condition to obtain ballot space.1900
A state may validly require that each voter participate only once in
each year’s nominating process and it may therefore disqualify any
person who votes in a primary election from signing nominating or
supporting petitions for independent parties or candidates.1901 Equally
valid is a state requirement that a candidate for elective office, as
an independent or in a regular party, must not have been affiliated
with a political party, or with one other than the one of which he
seeks its nomination, within one year prior to the primary election
at which nominations for the general election are made.1902 So too,
a state may limit access to the general election ballot to candidates
who received at least 1% of the primary votes cast for the particu-
lar office.1903 But it is impermissible to print the names of the can-
didates of the two major parties only on the absentee ballots, leav-
ing off independents and other parties.1904 Also invalidated was a

     1899 American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 783 (1974). In Storer v.

Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 738–40 (1974), the Court remanded so that the district court
could determine whether the burden imposed on an independent party was too se-
vere, it being required in 24 days in 1972 to gather 325,000 signatures from a pool
of qualified voters who had not voted in that year’s partisan primary elections. See
also Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173 (1979)
(voiding provision that required a larger number of signatures to get on ballot in
subdivisions than statewide).
     1900 American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 788–91 (1974). The percent-

ages varied with the office but no more than 500 signatures were needed in any
event.
     1901 415 U.S. at 785–87.
     1902 Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 728–37 (1974). Dissenting, Justices Bren-

nan, Douglas and Marshall thought the state interest could be adequately served by
a shorter time period than a year before the primary election, which meant in effect
17 months before the general election. Id. at 755.

     1904 American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 794–95 (1974). Upheld,

however, was state financing of the primary election expenses that excluded conven-
tion expenses of the small parties. Id. at 791–94. But the major parties had to hold
