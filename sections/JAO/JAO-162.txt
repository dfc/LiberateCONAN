instance, with the advent of the automobile, States were permitted
to engage in the fiction that the use of their highways was condi-
tioned upon the consent of drivers to be sued in state courts for
accidents or other transactions arising out of such use. Thus, a state
could designate a state official as a proper person to receive service
of process in such litigation, and establishing jurisdiction required
only that the official receiving notice communicate it to the person
sued.864
     Although the Court approved of the legal fiction that such juris-
diction arose out of consent, the basis for jurisdiction was really the
state’s power to regulate acts done in the state that were danger-
ous to life or property.865 Because the state did not really have the
ability to prevent nonresidents from doing business in their state,866
this extension was necessary in order to permit states to assume
jurisdiction over individuals “doing business” within the state. Thus,
the Court soon recognized that “doing business” within a state was
itself a sufficient basis for jurisdiction over a nonresident indi-
vidual, at least where the business done was exceptional enough to
create a strong state interest in regulation, and service could be
effectuated within the state on an agent appointed to carry out the
business.867
     The culmination of this trend, established in International Shoe
Co. v. Washington,868 was the requirement that there be “minimum
contacts” with the state in question in order to establish jurisdic-
tion. The outer limit of this test is illustrated by Kulko v. Superior
Court,869 in which the Court held that California could not obtain
personal jurisdiction over a New York resident whose sole relevant
contact with the state was to send his daughter to live with her
mother in California.870 The argument was made that the father
had “caused an effect” in the state by availing himself of the ben-
efits and protections of California’s laws and by deriving an eco-
nomic benefit in the lessened expense of maintaining the daughter
court proceedings and he loses, it is within the power of a state to require that he
submit to the jurisdiction of the court to determine the merits. York v. Texas, 137

     870 Kulko had visited the state twice, seven and six years respectively before

initiation of the present action, his marriage occurring in California on the second
visit, but neither the visits nor the marriage was sufficient or relevant to jurisdic-
tion. 436 U.S. at 92–93.
