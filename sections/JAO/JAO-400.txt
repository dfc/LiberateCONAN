gress to exercise its discretion in fashioning remedies to achieve civil
and political equality for all citizens.” Within this discretion is the
“power to determine that in order adequately to protect the right
to equal utilization of state facilities, it is also appropriate to pun-
ish other individuals” who would deny such access.2103
    The Court, however, ultimately rejected this expansion of the
powers of Congress in United States v. Morrison.2104 In Morrison,
the Court invalidated a provision of the Violence Against Women
Act 2105 that established a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-
motivated violence. The case involved a university student who brought
a civil action against other students who allegedly raped her. The
argument was made that there was a pervasive bias against vic-
tims of gender-motivated violence in state justice systems, and that
the federal remedy would offset and deter this bias. The Court first
reaffirmed the state action requirement for legislation passed un-
der the Fourteenth Amendment,2106 dismissing the dicta in Guest,
and reaffirming the precedents of the Civil Rights Cases and United
States v. Harris. The Court also rejected the assertion that the leg-
islation was “corrective” of bias in the courts, as the suits are not
directed at the state or any state actor, but rather at the individu-
als committing the criminal acts.2107

     2106 529 U.S. at 621 (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948), for the

proposition that the Amendment “erects no shield against merely private conduct,
however discriminatory or wrongful”).
     2107 This holding may have broader significance for federal civil rights law. For

instance, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) (a civil statute paralleling the criminal statute held
unconstitutional in United States v. Harris) lacks a “color of law” requirement. Al-
though the requirement was read into it in Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651 (1951),
to avoid constitutional problems, it was read out again in Griffin v. Breckenridge,
403 U.S. 88, 97 (1971) (although it might be “difficult to conceive of what might
constitute a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws by private persons . . .
there is nothing inherent in the phrase that requires the action working the depri-
vation to come from the State”). What the unanimous Court held in Griffin was that
an “intent to deprive of equal protection, or equal privileges and immunities, means
that there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously dis-
criminatory animus behind the conspirators’ action.” Id. at 102. As so construed, the
statute was held constitutional as applied in the complaint before the Court on the
basis of the Thirteenth Amendment and the right to travel; there was no necessity
therefore, to consider Congress’s powers under § 5 of the 14th Amendment. Id. at
107.
     The lower courts have been quite divided with respect to what constitutes a
non-racial, class-based animus, and what constitutional protections must be threat-
ened before a private conspiracy can be reached under § 1985(3). See, e.g., Action v.
Gannon, 450 F.2d 1227 (8th Cir. 1971); Dombrowski v. Dowling, 459 F.2d 190 (7th
Cir. 1972); Great American Fed. S. & L. Ass’n v. Novotny, 584 F.2d 1235 (3d Cir.
