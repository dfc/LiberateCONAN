land Board of Education v. LaFleur,1841 which was decided upon
due process grounds, two school systems requiring pregnant school
teachers to leave work four and five months respectively before the
expected childbirths were found to have acted arbitrarily and irra-
tionally in establishing rules not supported by anything more weighty
than administrative convenience buttressed with some possible em-
barrassment of the school boards in the face of pregnancy. On the
other hand, the exclusion of pregnancy from a state financed pro-
gram of payments to persons disabled from employment was up-
held against equal protection attack as supportable by legitimate
state interests in the maintenance of a self-sustaining program with
rates low enough to permit the participation of low-income workers
at affordable levels.1842 The absence of supportable reasons in one
case and their presence in the other may well have made the sig-
nificant difference.
Illegitimacy
    After wrestling in a number of cases with the question of the
permissibility of governmental classifications disadvantaging il-
legitimates and the standard for determining which classifications
are sustainable, the Court arrived at a standard difficult to state
and even more difficult to apply.1843 Although “illegitimacy is analo-
gous in many respects to the personal characteristics that have been
held to be suspect when used as the basis of statutory differentia-
tions,” the analogy is “not sufficient to require ‘our most exacting
scrutiny.’ ” The scrutiny to which it is entitled is intermediate, “not
a toothless [scrutiny],” but somewhere between that accorded race
and that accorded ordinary economic classifications. Basically, the
standard requires a determination of a legitimate legislative aim
     1841 414 U.S. 632 (1974). Justice Powell concurred on equal protection grounds.

Id. at 651. See also Turner v. Department of Employment Security, 423 U.S. 44 (1975).
     1842 Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974). The Court denied that the classifi-

cation was based upon “gender as such.” Classification was on the basis of preg-
nancy, and while only women can become pregnant, that fact alone was not determi-
native. “The program divides potential recipients into two groups—pregnant woman
and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second
includes members of both sexes.” Id. at 496 n.20. For a rejection of a similar at-
tempted distinction, see Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9 (1977); and Trimble v.
Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 774 (1977). See also Phillips v. Martin-Marietta Corp., 400
U.S. 542 (1971). The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k), now ex-
tends protection to pregnant women.
     1843 The first cases set the stage for the lack of consistency. Compare Levy v.

Louisiana, 391 U.S. 68 (1968), and Glona v. American Guar. & Liab. Ins. Co., 391
U.S. 73 (1968), invalidating laws that precluded wrongful death actions in cases in-
volving the child or the mother when the child was illegitimate, in which scrutiny
was strict, with Labine v. Vincent, 401 U.S. 532 (1971), involving intestate succes-
sion, in which scrutiny was rational basis, and Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety
Co., 406 U.S. 164 (1972), involving a workers’ compensation statute distinguishing
between legitimates and illegitimates, in which scrutiny was intermediate.
