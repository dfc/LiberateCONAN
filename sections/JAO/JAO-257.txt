appears in many other contexts as well,1377 including so-called “class-
of-one” challenges.1378 A more active review has been developed for
classifications based on a “suspect” indicium or affecting a “funda-
mental” interest. “The Fourteenth Amendment enjoins ‘the equal pro-
tection of the laws,’ and laws are not abstract propositions.” Justice
Frankfurter once wrote, “They do not relate to abstract units, A, B,
and C, but are expressions of policy arising out of specific difficul-
ties, addressed to the attainment of specific ends by the use of spe-
cific remedies. The Constitution does not require things which are
different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were
the same.” 1379 Thus, the mere fact of classification will not void leg-
islation,1380 because in the exercise of its powers a legislature has
considerable discretion in recognizing the differences between and
among persons and situations.1381 “Class legislation, discriminat-
ing against some and favoring others, is prohibited; but legislation
which, in carrying out a public purpose, is limited in its applica-
tion, if within the sphere of its operation it affects alike all persons
similarly situated, is not within the amendment.” 1382 Or, more suc-


     1377 Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997) (assisted suicide prohibition does not vio-

late Equal Protection Clause by distinguishing between terminally ill patients on
life-support systems who are allowed to direct the removal of such systems and pa-
tients who are not on life support systems and are not allowed to hasten death by
self-administering prescribed drugs).
     1378 The Supreme Court has recognized successful equal protection claims brought

by a class-of-one, where a plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated
differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for that
difference. Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam)
(village’s demand for an easement as a condition of connecting the plaintiff ’s prop-
erty to the municipal water supply was irrational and wholly arbitrary). However,
the class-of-one theory, which applies with respect to legislative and regulatory ac-
tion, does not apply in the public employment context. Engquist v. Oregon Depart-
ment of Agriculture, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 2149 (2008) (allegation that plaintiff was fired
not because she was a member of an identified class but simply for “arbitrary, vin-
dictive, and malicious reasons” does not state an equal protection claim). In Engquist,
the Court noted that “the government as employer indeed has far broader powers
than does the government as sovereign,” id. at 2151 (quoting Waters v. Churchill,
511 U.S. 661, 671 (1994), and that it is a “common-sense realization” that govern-
ment offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitu-
tional matter. Id. at 2151, 2156.
