graphic displays, and the like.1058 But not all cases have alleged
careful police orchestration.1059
    The Court generally disfavors judicial suppression of eyewit-
ness identifications on due process grounds in lieu of having
identification testimony tested in the normal course of the
adversarial process.1060 Two elements are required for due pro-
cess suppression. First, law enforcement officers must have par-
ticipated in an identification process that was both suggestive
and unnecessary.1061 Second, the identification procedures must
have created a substantial prospect for misidentification. Deter-
mination of these elements is made by examining the “totality of
the circumstances” of a case.1062 The Court has not recognized
any per se rule for excluding an eyewitness identification on due




     1058 E.g., Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114–17 (1977) (only one photo-

graph provided to witness); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 196–201 (1972) (showup
in which police walked defendant past victim and ordered him to speak); Coleman
v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970) (lineup); Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440 (1969) (two
lineups, in one of which the suspect was sole participant above average height, and
arranged one-on-one meeting between eyewitness and suspect); Simmons v. United
States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968) (series of group photographs each of which contained
suspect); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967) (suspect brought to witness’s hospi-
tal room).
     1059 Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–8974, slip op. (2012) (prior

to being approached by police for questioning, witness by chance happened to see
suspect standing in parking lot near police officer; no manipulation by police al-
leged).
     1060 See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–8974, slip op. at 6–7,

15–17 (2012).
     1061 “Suggestive confrontations are disapproved because they increase the likeli-

hood of misidentification, and unnecessarily suggestive ones are condemned for the
further reason that the increased chance of misidentification is gratuitous.” Neil v.
Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972). An identification process can be found to be sug-
gestive regardless of police intent. Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–
8974, slip op. at 2 & n.1 (2012) (circumstances of identification found to be sugges-
tive but not contrived; no due process relief). The necessity of using a particular
procedure depends on the circumstances. E.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967)
(suspect brought handcuffed to sole witness’s hospital room where it was uncertain
whether witness would survive her wounds).
     1062 Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 196–201 (1972); Manson v. Brathwaite, 432

U.S. 98, 114–17 (1977). The factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of
misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the suspect at the
time of the crime, the witness’s degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness’s
prior description of the suspect, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness
at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confronta-
tion. See also Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967).
