cise of a second fundamental personal right, the right to travel.” 1866
The Court indicated that the states have “a legitimate and compel-
ling interest” in preventing fraud by voters, but that “it is impos-
sible to view durational residence requirements as necessary to achieve
that state interest.” 1867
    However, a 50-day durational residence requirement was sus-
tained in the context of the closing of the registration process at 50
days prior to elections and of the mechanics of the state’s registra-
tion process. The period, the Court found, was necessary to achieve
the state’s legitimate goals.1868
    A state that exercised general criminal, taxing, and other juris-
diction over persons on certain federal enclaves within the state,
the Court held, could not treat these persons as nonresidents for
voting purposes.1869 A statute that provided that anyone who en-
tered military service outside the state could not establish voting
residence in the state so long as he remained in the military was
held to deny to such a person the opportunity such as all non-
military persons enjoyed of showing that he had established resi-
dence.1870 Restricting the suffrage to those persons who had paid a
poll tax was an invidious discrimination because it introduced a “ca-
pricious or irrelevant factor” of wealth or ability to pay into an area
in which it had no place.1871 Extending this ruling, the Court held
that the eligibility to vote in local school elections may not be lim-
ited to persons owning property in the district or who have chil-

curiam) (vacating an injunction against “requiring voters to present proof of citizen-
ship when they register to vote and to present identification when they vote on elec-
tion day,” but expressing no opinion on the constitutionality of the requirement).
     1867 405 U.S. at 345. Other asserted state interests—knowledgeability of voters,

common interests, intelligent voting—were said either not to be served by the re-
quirements or to be impermissible interests.
     1868 Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679 (1973). Registration was by volunteer work-

ers who made statistically significant errors requiring corrections by county record-
ers before certification. Primary elections were held in the fall, thus occupying the
time of the recorders, so that a backlog of registrations had to be processed before
the election. A period of 50 days rather than 30, the Court thought, was justifiable.
However, the same period was upheld for another state on the authority of Marston
in the absence of such justification, but it appeared that the plaintiffs had not con-
troverted the state’s justifying evidence. Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686 (1973). Jus-
tices Brennan, Douglas, and Marshall dissented in both cases. Id. at 682, 688.
     1869 Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419 (1970).
     1870 Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89 (1965).
     1871 Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966). Justices Black, Har-

lan, and Stewart dissented. Id. at 670, 680. Poll tax qualifications had previously
been upheld in Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U.S. 277 (1937); and Butler v. Thompson,
341 U.S. 937 (1951).
