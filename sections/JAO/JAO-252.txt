suasive than the fact of regulation of such an entity in demonstrating
that the State is responsible for decisions made by the entity in
the course of its business.” 1347
     In the social welfare area, the Court has drawn a sharp distinc-
tion between governmental action subject to substantive due pro-
cess requirements, and governmental inaction, not so constrained.
There being “no affirmative right to governmental aid,” the Court
announced in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Social Services De-
partment 1348 that “as a general matter, . . . a State’s failure to pro-
tect an individual against private violence simply does not consti-
tute a violation of the Due Process Clause.” Before there can be
state involvement creating an affirmative duty to protect an indi-
vidual, the Court explained, the state must have taken a person
into its custody and held him there against his will so as to re-
strict his freedom to act on his own behalf. Thus, although the Court
had recognized due process violations for failure to provide ad-
equate medical care to incarcerated prisoners,1349 and for failure to
ensure reasonable safety for involuntarily committed mental pa-
tients,1350 no such affirmative duty arose from the failure of social
services agents to protect an abused child from further abuse from
his parent. Even though possible abuse had been reported to the
agency and confirmed and monitored by the agency, and the agency
had done nothing to protect the child, the Court emphasized that
the actual injury was inflicted by the parent and “did not occur while
[the child] was in the State’s custody.” 1351 Although the state may
have incurred liability in tort through the negligence of its social
workers, “[not] every tort committed by a state actor [is] a constitu-
tional violation.” 1352 “[I]t is well to remember . . . that the harm
was inflicted not by the State of Wisconsin, but by [the child’s] fa-
ther.” 1353
     Judicial inquiry into the existence of “state action” may lead to
different results depending on what remedy is sought to be en-
forced. While cases may be brought against a private actor to com-
pel him to halt his discriminatory action (for example, to enjoin him
to admit blacks to a lunch counter), one could just as readily bring
suit against the government to compel it to cease aiding the pri-
vate actor in his discriminatory conduct. Enforcing the latter rem-
edy might well avoid constitutional issues that an order directed to
