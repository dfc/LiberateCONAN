all.1108 The holding of the Winship case, however, left open the ques-
tion as to whether appellate courts should weigh the sufficiency of
trial evidence. Thus, in Jackson v. Virginia,1109 the Court held that
federal courts, on direct appeal of federal convictions or collateral
review of state convictions, must satisfy themselves that the evi-
dence on the record could reasonably support a finding of guilt be-
yond a reasonable doubt. The question the reviewing court is to ask
itself is not whether it believes the evidence at the trial estab-
lished guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether, after viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any ra-
tional trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the
crime beyond a reasonable doubt.1110
     Because due process requires the prosecution to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime
charged,1111 the Court held in Mullaney v. Wilbur 1112 that it was
unconstitutional to require a defendant charged with murder to prove
that he acted “in the heat of passion on sudden provocation” in or-
der to reduce the homicide to manslaughter. The Court indicated
that a balancing-of-interests test should be used to determine when
the Due Process Clause required the prosecution to carry the bur-
den of proof and when some part of the burden might be shifted to
the defendant. The decision, however, called into question the prac-
tice in many states under which some burdens of persuasion 1113 were
borne by the defense, and raised the prospect that the prosecution
must bear all burdens of persuasion—a significant and weighty task
given the large numbers of affirmative defenses.

368 U.S. 157 (1961); Taylor v. Louisiana, 370 U.S. 154 (1962); Barr v. City of Colum-
bia, 378 U.S. 146 (1964); Johnson v. Florida, 391 U.S. 596 (1968). See also Chess-
man v. Teets, 354 U.S. 156 (1957).

     1110 443 U.S. at 3116, 318–19. On a somewhat related point, the Court has ruled

that a general guilty verdict on a multiple-object conspiracy need not be set aside if
the evidence is inadequate to support conviction as to one of the objects of the con-
spiracy, but is adequate to support conviction as to another. Griffin v. United States,
112 U.S. 466 (1991).
     1111 Bunkley v. Florida, 538 U.S. 835 (2003); Fiore v. White, 528 U.S. 23 (1999).

These cases both involved defendants convicted under state statutes that were sub-
sequently interpreted in a way that would have precluded their conviction. The Court
remanded the cases to determine if the new interpretation was in effect at the time
of the previous convictions, in which case those convictions would violate due pro-
cess.

     1113 The general notion of “burden of proof ” can be divided into the “burden of

production” (providing probative evidence on a particular issue) and a “burden of
persuasion” (persuading the factfinder with respect to an issue by a standard such
as proof beyond a reasonable doubt). Mullaney, 421 U.S. at 695 n.20.
