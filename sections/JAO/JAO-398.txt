tal rights specified in the amendment.” 2089 The holding in this case
had already been preceded by United States v. Cruikshank 2090 and
by United States v. Harris 2091 in which the Federal Government
had prosecuted individuals for killing and injuring African-
Americans. The Amendment did not increase the power of the Fed-
eral Government vis-a-vis individuals, the Court held, only with re-
gard to the states themselves.2092
     Cruikshank did, however, recognize a small category of federal
rights that Congress could protect against private deprivation, rights
that the Court viewed as deriving particularly from one’s status as
a citizen of the United States and that Congress had a general po-
lice power to protect.2093 These rights included the right to vote in
federal elections, general and primary,2094 the right to federal pro-
tection while in the custody of federal officers,2095 and the right to
inform federal officials of violations of federal law.2096 The right of
interstate travel is a basic right derived from the Federal Constitu-
tion, which Congress may protect.2097 In United States v. Wil-
liams,2098 in the context of state action, the Court divided four-to-
four over whether the predecessor of 18 U.S.C. § 241 in its reference
to a “right or privilege secured . . . by the Constitution or laws of
the United States” encompassed rights guaranteed by the Four-
teenth Amendment, or was restricted to those rights “which Con-
gress can beyond doubt constitutionally secure against interference
by private individuals.” This issue was again reached in United States

     2089 109 U.S. at 11. Justice Harlan’s dissent reasoned that Congress had the power

to protect rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment against invasion by both
state and private action, but also viewed places of public accommodation as serving
a quasi-public function that satisfied the state action requirement in any event. Id.
at 46–48, 56–57.
     2090 92 U.S. 542 (1876). The action was pursuant to § 6 of the 1870 Enforce-

     2091 106 U.S. 629 (1883). The case held unconstitutional a provision of § 2 of the

     2093 United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552–53, 556 (1876). The rights

were the right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances and the right to vote
free of interference on racial grounds in a federal election.
