    The power to regulate also includes the power to forbid certain
business practices. Thus, a state may forbid the giving of options
to sell or buy any grain or other commodity at a future time.238 It
may also forbid sales on margin for future delivery,239 and may pro-
hibit the keeping of places where stocks, grain, and the like, are
sold but not paid for at the time, unless a record of the same be
made and a stamp tax paid.240 A prohibitive license fee upon the
use of trading stamps is not unconstitutional,241 nor is imposing crimi-
nal penalties for any deductions by purchasers from the actual weight
of grain, hay, seed, or coal purchased, even when such deduction is
made under a claim of custom or under a rule of a board of trade.242
    Banking, Wage Assignments, and Garnishment.—Regula-
tion of banks and banking has always been considered well within
the police power of states, and the Fourteenth Amendment did not
eliminate this regulatory authority.243 A variety of regulations have
been upheld over the years. For example, state banks are not de-
prived of property without due process by a statute subjecting them
to assessments for a depositors’ guaranty fund.244 Also, a law requir-
ing savings banks to turn over deposits inactive for thirty years to
the state (when the depositor cannot be found), with provision for
payment to the depositor or his heirs on establishment of the right,
does not effect an invalid taking of the property of said banks; nor
does a statute requiring banks to turn over to the protective cus-
tody of the state deposits that, depending on the nature of the de-
posit, have been inactive ten or twenty-five years.245

new statute has all the functions of a receiver under the old law, one of which is the
enforcement on behalf of depositors of stockholders’ liability, which liability the con-
servator can enforce as cheaply as could a receiver appointed under the pre-existing
statute, it cannot be said that the new statute, in suspending the right of a deposi-
