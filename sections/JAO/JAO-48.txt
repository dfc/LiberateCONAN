city’s wires free of charge, and that required that conduits be moved
at company expense, was constitutional.197
     And, the fact that a state, by mere legislative or administrative
fiat, cannot convert a private carrier into a common carrier will not
protect a foreign corporation that has elected to enter a state that
requires that it operate its local private pipe line as a common car-
rier. Such a foreign corporation is viewed as having waived its con-
stitutional right to be secure against the imposition of conditions
that amount to a taking of property without due process of law.198
    Compulsory Expenditures: Grade Crossings, and the Like.—
Generally, the enforcement of uncompensated obedience to a regu-
lation for the public health and safety is not an unconstitutional
taking of property in violation of due process.199 Thus, where a wa-
ter company laid its lines on an ungraded street, and the appli-
cable rule at the time of the granting of its charter compelled the
company to furnish connections at its own expense to one residing
on such a street, due process is not violated.200 Or, where a gas com-
pany laid its pipes under city streets, it may validly be obligated to
assume the cost of moving them to accommodate a municipal drain-
age system.201 Or, railroads may be required to help fund the elimi-
nation of grade crossings, even though commercial highway users,
who make no contribution whatsoever, benefit from such improve-
ments.
