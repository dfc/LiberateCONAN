    A state is acting clearly within its police power in fixing maxi-
mum rates of interest on money loaned within its border, and such
regulation is within legislative discretion if not unreasonable or ar-
bitrary.246 Equally valid is a requirement that assignments of fu-
ture wages as security for debts of less than $200, to be valid, must
be accepted in writing by the employer, consented to by the assign-
ors, and filed in public office. Such a requirement deprives neither
the borrower nor the lender of his property without due process of
law.247
     Insurance.—Those engaged in the insurance business 248 as well
as the business itself have been peculiarly subject to supervision
and control.249 Even during the Lochner era the Court recognized
that government may fix insurance rates and regulate the compen-
sation of insurance agents,250 and over the years the Court has up-
held a wide variety of regulation. For instance, a state may impose
a fine on “any person ‘who shall act in any manner in the negotia-
tion or transaction of unlawful insurance . . . with a foreign insur-
ance company not admitted to do business [within said State].’ ” 251
Or, a state may forbid life insurance companies and their agents to
engage in the undertaking business and undertakers to serve as
life insurance agents.252 Further, foreign casualty and surety insur-
ers were not deprived of due process by a Virginia law that prohib-
ited the making of contracts of casualty or surety insurance except
through registered agents, that required that such contracts appli-
cable to persons or property in the state be countersigned by a reg-
istered local agent, and that prohibited such agents from sharing
more than 50% of a commission with a nonresident broker.253 And
just as all banks may be required to contribute to a depositors’ guar-
anty fund, so may automobile liability insurers be required to sub-
mit to the equitable apportionment among them of applicants who

tor to have a receiver appointed, arbitrarily deprives a depositor of his remedy or
destroys his property without the due process of law. The depositor has no property
right in any particular form of remedy. Gibbes v. Zimmerman, 290 U.S. 326 (1933).

     253 Osborn v. Ozlin, 310 U.S. 53, 68–69 (1940). Dissenting from the conclusion,

Justice Roberts declared that the plain effect of the Virginia law is to compel a non-
resident to pay a Virginia resident for services that the latter does not in fact ren-
der.
