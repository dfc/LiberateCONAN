     The case of Reitman v. Mulkey 1298 was similar to Shelley in both
its controversy and the uncertainty of its rationale. In Reitman, the
Court struck down an amendment to the California Constitution
that prohibited the state and its subdivisions and agencies from for-
bidding racial discrimination in private housing. The Court, find-
ing the provision to deny equal protection of the laws, appeared to
ground its decision on either of two lines of reasoning. First was
that the provision constituted state action to impermissibly encour-
age private racial discrimination. Second was that the provision made
discriminatory racial practices immune from the ordinary legisla-
tive process, and thus impermissibly burdened minorities in the
achievement of legitimate aims.1299 In a subsequent case, Hunter v.
Erickson,1300 the latter rationale was used in a unanimous decision
voiding an Akron ordinance, which suspended an “open housing” or-
dinance and provided that any future ordinance regulating transac-
tions in real property “on the basis of race, color, religion, national
origin or ancestry” must be submitted to a vote of the people before
it could become effective.1301
     Two later decisions involving state referenda on busing for inte-
gration confirm that the condemning factor of Mulkey and Hunter
was the imposition of barriers to racial amelioration legislation.1302
Both cases agree that “the simple repeal or modification of desegre-
gation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, never has been viewed
     1298 387 U.S. 369 (1967). The decision was 5-to-4, Justices Harlan, Black, Clark,

and Stewart dissenting. Id. at 387.
     1299 See, e.g., 387 U.S. at 377 (language suggesting both lines of reasoning). But

see City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye Community Hope Foundation, 538 U.S. 188
(2003) (ministerial acts associated with a referendum repealing a low-income hous-
ing ordinance did not constitute state action, as the referendum process was facially
neutral, and the potentially discriminatory repeal was never enforced).
     1300 393 U.S. 385 (1969).
     1301 In contrast, other ordinances would become effective when passed, except

that petitions could be submitted to revoke those ordinances by referendum. 393
U.S. at 389–90 (1969). In Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff’d,
402 U.S. 935 (1971), New York enacted a statute prohibiting the assignment of stu-
dents or the establishment of school districts for the purpose of achieving racial bal-
ance in attendance, unless with the express approval of a locally elected school board
or with the consent of the parents, a measure designed to restrict the state educa-
tion commissioner’s program to ameliorate de facto segregation. The federal court
held the law void, relying on Mulkey to conclude that the statute encouraged racial
discrimination and that by treating educational matters involving racial criteria dif-
ferently than it treated other educational matters it made more difficult a resolu-
tion of the de facto segregation problem.
     1302 Washington v. Seattle School Dist., 458 U.S. 457 (1982); Crawford v. Los

Angeles Bd. of Educ., 458 U.S. 527 (1982). A five-to-four majority in Seattle found
the fault to be a racially based structuring of the political process making it more
difficult to undertake actions designed to improve racial conditions than to under-
take any other educational action. An 8-to-1 majority in Crawford found that repeal
of a measure to bus to undo de facto segregation, without imposing any barrier to
other remedial devices, was permissible.
