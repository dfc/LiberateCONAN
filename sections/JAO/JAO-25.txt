practice and disadvantaged opticians and those employed by or us-
ing space in business establishments. “The day is gone when this
Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial con-
ditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of har-
mony with a particular school of thought. . . . We emphasize again
what Chief Justice Waite said in Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 134,
‘For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must re-
sort to the polls, not to the courts.’ ” 83 The Court went on to assess
the reasons that might have justified the legislature in prescribing
the regulation at issue, leaving open the possibility that some regu-
lation might be found unreasonable.84 More recent decisions have
limited this inquiry to whether the legislation is arbitrary or irra-
tional, and have abandoned any requirement of “reasonable-
ness.” 85

Regulation of Labor Conditions
    Liberty of Contract.—One of the most important concepts used
during the ascendancy of economic due process was liberty of con-
tract. The original idea of economic liberties was advanced by Jus-
tices Bradley and Field in the Slaughter-House Cases,86 and el-
evated to the status of accepted doctrine in Allgeyer v. Louisiana,87
It was then used repeatedly during the early part of this century
to strike down state and federal labor regulations. “The liberty men-

    84  348 U.S. at 487, 491.
     85 The Court has pronounced a strict “hands-off” standard of judicial review, whether

of congressional or state legislative efforts to structure and accommodate the bur-
dens and benefits of economic life. Such legislation is to be “accorded the traditional
presumption of constitutionality generally accorded economic regulations” and is to
be “upheld absent proof of arbitrariness or irrationality on the part of Congress.”
That the accommodation among interests which the legislative branch has struck
“may have profound and far-reaching consequences . . . provides all the more rea-
son for this Court to defer to the congressional judgment unless it is demonstrably
arbitrary or irrational.” Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group,
438 U.S. 59, 83–84 (1978). See also Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1,

land, 437 U.S. 117, 124–25 (1978); Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen v. Chicago,

(1963).

     87 165 U.S. 578 (1897). Freedom of contract was also alluded to as a property

right, as is evident in the language of the Court in Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1,
14 (1915). “Included in the right of personal liberty and the right of private property—
partaking of the nature of each—is the right to make contracts for the acquisition
of property. Chief among such contracts is that of personal employment, by which
labor and other services are exchanged for money or other forms of property. If this
right be struck down or arbitrarily interfered with, there is a substantial impair-
ment of liberty in the long-established constitutional sense.”
