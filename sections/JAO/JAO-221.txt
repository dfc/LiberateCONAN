may well afford the court insights into the nature of the crime and
the character of the defendant that were not available following the
initial guilty plea.1177
    Corrective Process: Appeals and Other Remedies.—“An ap-
peal from a judgment of conviction is not a matter of absolute right,
independently of constitutional or statutory provisions allowing such
appeal. A review by an appellate court of the final judgment in a
criminal case, however grave the offense of which the accused is
convicted, was not at common law and is not now a necessary ele-
ment of due process of law. It is wholly within the discretion of the
State to allow or not to allow such a review.” 1178 This holding has
been reaffirmed,1179 although the Court has also held that, when a
state does provide appellate review, it may not so condition the privi-
lege as to deny it irrationally to some persons, such as indigents.1180
    A state is not free, however, to have no corrective process in
which defendants may pursue remedies for federal constitutional
violations. In Frank v. Mangum,1181 the Court asserted that a con-
viction obtained in a mob-dominated trial was contrary to due pro-
cess: “if the State, supplying no corrective process, carries into ex-
ecution a judgment of death or imprisonment based upon a verdict
thus produced by mob domination, the State deprives the accused
of his life or liberty without due process of law.” Consequently, the
Court has stated numerous times that the absence of some form of
corrective process when the convicted defendant alleges a federal
constitutional violation contravenes the Fourteenth Amend-
ment,1182 and the Court has held that to burden this process, such

sentence represents vindictiveness also is inapplicable if the second trial came about
because the trial judge herself concluded that a retrial was necessary due to prosecuto-
rial misconduct before the jury in the first trial. Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134

     1180 The line of cases begins with Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), in which

it was deemed to violate both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses for
a state to deny to indigent defendants free transcripts of the trial proceedings, which
would enable them adequately to prosecute appeals from convictions. See analysis

Protection—Generally,” infra.
