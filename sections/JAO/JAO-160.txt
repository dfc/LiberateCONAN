time, however, the mobility of American society and the increasing
complexity of commerce led to attenuation of the second principle
of Pennoyer, and consequently the Court established the modern stan-
dard of obtaining jurisdiction based upon the nature and the qual-
ity of contacts that individuals and corporations have with a state.855
This “minimum contacts” test, consequently, permits state courts to
obtain power over out-of-state defendants.
     In Personam Proceedings Against Individuals.—How juris-
diction is determined depends on the nature of the suit being brought.
If a dispute is directed against a person, not property, the proceed-
ings are considered in personam, and jurisdiction must be estab-
lished over the defendant’s person in order to render an effective
decree.856 Generally, presence within the state is sufficient to cre-
ate personal jurisdiction over an individual, if process is served.857
In the case of a resident who is absent from the state, domicile alone
is deemed to be sufficient to keep him within reach of the state courts

and, more important, a concern for the preservation of federalism. International Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 319 (1945); Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251
(1958). The Framers, the Court has asserted, while intending to tie the States to-
gether into a Nation, “also intended that the States retain many essential attri-
butes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in
their courts. The sovereignty of each State, in turn, implied a limitation on the sov-
ereignty of all its sister States—a limitation express or implicit in both the original
scheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment.” World-Wide Volkswagen
Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980). Thus, the federalism principle is preemi-
nent. “[T]he Due Process Clause ‘does not contemplate that a state may make bind-
ing a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which
the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.’ . . . Even if the defendant would suffer
minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of
another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to
the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litiga-
tion, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may
sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.” 444 U.S.

319 (1945)).
     855 International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945)). As the Court

explained in McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223 (1957), “[w]ith
this increasing nationalization of commerce has come a great increase in the amount
of business conducted by mail across state lines. At the same time modern transpor-
tation and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to
defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity.” See World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980)). The first principle, that a
State may assert jurisdiction over anyone or anything physically within its borders,
no matter how briefly there—the so-called “transient” rule of jurisdiction—
McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917), remains valid, although in Shaffer v.
Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204 (1977), the Court’s dicta appeared to assume it is not.

v. Negaunee Iron Co., 197 U.S. 463, 471 (1905).
