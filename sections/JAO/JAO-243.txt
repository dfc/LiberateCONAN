be effectuated in any manner by action of the state, as by enforce-
ment of trespass laws or judicial enforcement of discrimination in
wills? Or did it rather forbid the action of the state in interfering
with the willingness of two private parties to deal with each other?
Disposition of several early cases possibly governed by Shelley left
this issue unanswered.1294 But the Court has experienced no diffi-
culty in finding that state court enforcement of common-law rules
in a way that has an impact upon speech and press rights is state
action and triggers the application of constitutional rules.1295
    It may be that the substantive rule that is being enforced is
the dispositive issue, rather than the mere existence of state ac-
tion. Thus, in Evans v. Abney,1296 a state court, asked to enforce a
discriminatory stipulation in a will that property devised to a city
for use as a public park should never be used by African-
Americans, ruled that the city could not operate the park in a seg-
regated fashion. Instead of striking the segregation requirement from
the will, however, the court instead ordered return of the property
to the decedent’s heirs, inasmuch as the trust had failed. The Su-
preme Court held the decision permissible, inasmuch as the state
court had merely carried out the testator’s intent with no racial mo-
tivation itself, and distinguished Shelley on the basis that African-
Americans were not discriminated against by the reversion, be-
cause everyone was deprived of use of the park.1297

ment of restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia as violating civil rights
legislation and public policy. Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249 (1953), held that dam-
age actions for violations of racially restrictive covenants would not be judicially en-
tertained.
     1294 Rice v. Sioux City Memorial Park Cemetery, 245 Iowa 147, 60 N.W. 2d 110

(1953), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 348 U.S. 880 (1954), rehearing granted,
judgment vacated and certiorari dismissed, 349 U.S. 70 (1955); Black v. Cutter Labo-
ratories, 351 U.S. 292 (1956). The central issue in the “sit-in” cases, whether state
enforcement of trespass laws at the behest of private parties acting on the basis of
their own discriminatory motivations, was evaded by the Court, in finding some other
form of state action and reversing all convictions. Individual Justices did elaborate,
however. Compare Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 255–60 (1964) (opinion of Justice
Douglas), with id. at 326 (Justices Black, Harlan, and White dissenting).
     1295 In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), and progeny, defa-

mation actions based on common-law rules were found to implicate First Amend-
ment rights and Court imposed varying limitations on such rules. See id. at 265
(finding state action). Similarly, in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886
(1982), a civil lawsuit between private parties, the application of state common-law
rules to assess damages for actions in a boycott and picketing was found to consti-
tute state action. Id. at 916 n.51.
     1296 396 U.S. 435 (1970). The matter had previously been before the Court in

Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966).
     1297 396 U.S. at 445. Note the use of the same rationale in another context in

Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 226 (1971). On a different result in the “Girard
College” will case, see Pennsylvania v. Board of Trustees, 353 U.S. 230 (1957), dis-
cussed infra.
