ing insufficient justification for a state’s preventing a political party
from allowing independents to vote in its primary.1883
    It must not be forgotten, however, that it is only when a state
extends the franchise to some and denies it to others that a “right
to vote” arises and is protected by the Equal Protection Clause. If
a state chooses to fill an office by means other than through an elec-
tion, neither the Equal Protection Clause nor any other constitu-
tional provision prevents it from doing so. Thus, in Rodriguez v. Popu-
lar Democratic Party,1884 the Court unanimously sustained a Puerto
Rico statute that authorized the political party to which an incum-
bent legislator belonged to designate his successor in office until the
next general election upon his death or resignation. Neither the fact
that the seat was filled by appointment nor the fact that the ap-
pointment was by the party, rather than by the governor or some
other official, raised a constitutional question.
    The right of unconvicted jail inmates and convicted misdemeanants
(who typically are under no disability) to vote by absentee ballot
remains unsettled. In an early case applying rational basis scru-
tiny, the Court held that the failure of a state to provide for absen-
tee balloting by unconvicted jail inmates, when absentee ballots were
available to other classes of voters, did not deny equal protection
when it was not shown that the inmates could not vote in any other
way.1885 Subsequently, the Court held unconstitutional a statute de-
nying absentee registration and voting rights to persons confined
awaiting trial or serving misdemeanor sentences, but it is unclear
whether the basis was the fact that persons confined in jails out-
side the county of their residences could register and vote absentee
while those confined in the counties of their residences could not,
or whether the statute’s jumbled distinctions among categories of
qualified voters on no rational standard made it wholly arbi-
trary.1886

      1883 Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208 (1986). Although

independents were allowed to register in a party on the day before a primary, the
state’s justifications for “protect[ing] the integrity of the Party against the Party it-
self ” were deemed insubstantial. Id. at 224.
