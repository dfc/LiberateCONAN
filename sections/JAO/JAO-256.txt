Equal Protection: Judging Classifications by Law
    A guarantee of equal protection of the laws was contained in
every draft leading up to the final version of section 1 of the Four-
teenth Amendment.1370 The desire to provide a firm constitutional
basis for already-enacted civil rights legislation 1371 and to place re-
peal beyond the accomplishment of a simple majority in a future
Congress was important to its sponsors.1372 No doubt there were
conflicting interpretations of the phrase “equal protection” among
sponsors and supporters and the legislative history does little to clarify
whether any sort of consensus was accomplished and if so what it
was. 1373 Although the Court early recognized that African-
Americans were the primary intended beneficiaries of the protec-
tions thus adopted,1374 the spare language was majestically uncon-
fined to so limited a class or to so limited a purpose. Though efforts
to argue for an expansive interpretation met with little initial suc-
cess,1375 the equal protection standard ultimately came to be appli-
cable to all classifications by legislative and other official bodies. Now,
the Equal Protection Clause looms large in the fields of civil rights
and fundamental liberties as a constitutional text affording the fed-
eral and state courts extensive powers of review with regard to dif-
ferential treatment of persons and classes.

tional standard of review of equal protection challenges of classifi-
cations developed largely though not entirely in the context of eco-
