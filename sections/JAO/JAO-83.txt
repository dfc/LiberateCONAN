resident in a stock exchange located in another state; 435 (7) stock
held by a resident in a foreign corporation that does no business
and has no property within the taxing state; 436 (8) stock in a for-
eign corporation owned by another foreign corporation transacting
its business within the taxing state; 437 (9) shares owned by nonresi-
dent shareholders in a domestic corporation, the tax being as-
sessed on the basis of corporate assets and payable by the corpora-
tion either out of its general fund or by collection from the
shareholder; 438(10) dividends of a corporation distributed ratably
among stockholders regardless of their residence outside the state; 439
(11) the transfer within the taxing state by one nonresident to an-
other of stock certificates issued by a foreign corporation; 440 and
(12) promissory notes executed by a domestic corporation, although
payable to banks in other states.441
    The following personal property taxes on intangibles have been
invalidated:(1) debts evidenced by notes in safekeeping within the
taxing state, but made and payable and secured by property in a
second state and owned by a resident of a third state; 442 (2) a tax,
measured by income, levied on trust certificates held by a resident,
     435 Citizens Nat’l Bank v. Durr, 257 U.S. 99, 109 (1921). “Double taxation” the

Court observed “by one and the same State is not” prohibited “by the Fourteenth
Amendment; much less is taxation by two States upon identical or closely related
property interest falling within the jurisdiction of both, forbidden.”
     436 Hawley v. Malden, 232 U.S. 1, 12 (1914). The Court attached no importance

to the fact that the shares were already taxed by the State in which the issuing
corporation was domiciled and might also be taxed by the State in which the stock
owner was domiciled, or at any rate did not find it necessary to pass upon the valid-
ity of the latter two taxes. The present levy was deemed to be tenable on the basis
of the benefit-protection theory, namely, “the economic advantages realized through
the protection at the place . . . [of business situs] of the ownership of rights in in-
tangibles. . . .” The Court also added that “undoubtedly the State in which a corpo-
ration is organized may . . . [tax] all of its shares whether owned by residents or
nonresidents.”
     437 First Bank Corp. v. Minnesota, 301 U.S. 234, 241 (1937). The shares repre-

sent an aliquot portion of the whole corporate assets, and the property right so rep-
resented arises where the corporation has its home, and is therefore within the tax-
ing jurisdiction of the State, notwithstanding that ownership of the stock may also
be a taxable subject in another State.
     438 Schuylkill Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, 302 U.S. 506 (1938).
     439 The Court found that all stockholders were the ultimate beneficiaries of the

corporation’s activities within the taxing State, were protected by the latter, and were
thus subject to the State’s jurisdiction. International Harvester Co. v. Department
of Taxation, 322 U.S. 435 (1944). This tax, though collected by the corporation, is on
the transfer to a stockholder of his share of corporate dividends within the taxing
State and is deducted from said dividend payments. Wisconsin Gas Co. v. United
States, 322 U.S. 526 (1944).
     440 New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U.S. 152 (1907).
     441 Graniteville Mfg. Co. v. Query, 283 U.S. 376 (1931). These taxes, however,

were deemed to have been laid, not on the property, but upon an event, the transfer
in one instance, and execution in the latter which took place in the taxing State.
     442 Buck v. Beach, 206 U.S. 392 (1907).
