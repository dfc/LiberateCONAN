eight to sixteen. The statute in Meyer was found to interfere with
the property interest of the plaintiff, a German teacher, in pursu-
ing his occupation, while the private school plaintiffs in Pierce were
threatened with destruction of their businesses and the values of
their properties.542 Yet in both cases the Court also permitted the
plaintiffs to represent the interests of parents and children in the
assertion of other noneconomic forms of “liberty.”
    “Without doubt,” Justice McReynolds said in Meyer, liberty “de-
notes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right
of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occu-
pations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a
home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dic-
tates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges
long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit
of happiness by free men.” 543 The right of the parents to have their
children instructed in a foreign language was “within the liberty of
the [Fourteenth] Amendment.” 544 Meyer was then relied on in Pierce
to assert that the statute there “unreasonably interferes with the
liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and edu-
cation of children under their control. . . . The child is not the mere
creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny
have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and pre-
pare him for additional obligations.” 545
    Although the Supreme Court continued to define noneconomic
liberty broadly in dicta,546 this new concept was to have little im-
pact for decades.547 Finally, in 1967, in Loving v. Virginia,548 the
Court held that a statute prohibiting interracial marriage denied
substantive due process. Marriage was termed “one of the ‘basic civil
