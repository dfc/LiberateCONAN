    A further tightening of jurisdictional standards occurred in Rush
v. Savchuk.928 The plaintiff was injured in a one-car accident in In-
diana while a passenger in a car driven by defendant. Plaintiff later
moved to Minnesota and sued defendant, still resident in Indiana,
in state court in Minnesota. There were no contacts between the
defendant and Minnesota, but defendant’s insurance company did
business there and plaintiff garnished the insurance contract, signed
in Indiana, under which the company was obligated to defend de-
fendant in litigation and indemnify him to the extent of the policy
limits. The Court refused to permit jurisdiction to be grounded on
the contract; the contacts justifying jurisdiction must be those of
the defendant engaging in purposeful activity related to the fo-
rum.929 Rush thus resulted in the demise of the controversial Seider
v. Roth doctrine, which lower courts had struggled to save after Shaf-
fer v. Heitner.930
    Actions in Rem: Estates, Trusts, Corporations.—Generally,
probate will occur where the decedent was domiciled, and, as a pro-
bate judgment is considered in rem, a determination as to assets in
that state will be determinative as to all interested persons.931 In-
sofar as the probate affects real or personal property beyond the
state’s boundaries, however, the judgment is in personam and can
bind only parties thereto or their privies.932 Thus, the Full Faith
and Credit Clause would not prevent an out-of-state court in the
state where the property is located from reconsidering the first court’s
finding of domicile, which could affect the ultimate disposition of
the property.933
    The difficulty of characterizing the existence of the res in a par-
ticular jurisdiction is illustrated by the in rem aspects of Hanson v.

    928  444 U.S. 320 (1980).
    929  444 U.S. at 328–30. In dissent, Justices Brennan and Stevens argued that
what the state courts had done was the functional equivalent of direct-action stat-
utes. Id. at 333 (Justice Stevens); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444
U.S. 286, 299 (1980) (Justice Brennan). The Court, however, refused so to view the
Minnesota garnishment action, saying that “[t]he State’s ability to exert its power
over the ‘nominal defendant’ is analytically prerequisite to the insurer’s entry into
the case as a garnishee.” Id. at 330–31. Presumably, the comment is not meant to
undermine the validity of such direct-action statutes, which was upheld in Watson
v. Employers Liability Assurance Corp., 348 U.S. 66 (1954), a choice-of-law case rather
than a jurisdiction case.
