United States, and rights secured by treaty.19 In Twining v. New
Jersey,20 the Court recognized “among the rights and privileges” of
national citizenship the right to pass freely from state to state,21
the right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances,22 the right
to vote for national officers,23 the right to enter public lands,24 the
right to be protected against violence while in the lawful custody of
a United States marshal,25 and the right to inform the United States
authorities of violation of its laws.26 Earlier, in a decision not men-
tioned in Twining, the Court had also acknowledged that the carry-
ing on of interstate commerce is “a right which every citizen of the
United States is entitled to exercise.” 27
    In modern times, the Court has continued the minor role ac-
corded to the clause, only occasionally manifesting a disposition to
enlarge the restraint that it imposes upon state action.28 In Hague
v. CIO,29 two and perhaps three justices thought that the freedom
to use municipal streets and parks for the dissemination of informa-
tion concerning provisions of a federal statute and to assemble peace-
    19  83 U.S. at 79–80.
    20  211 U.S. 78, 97 (1908).
     21 Citing Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 (1868). It was observed in

United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 299 (1920), that the statute at issue in Crandall
was actually held to burden directly the performance by the United States of its
governmental functions. Cf. Passenger Cases (Smith v. Turner), 48 U.S. (7 How.)
283, 491–92 (1849) (Chief Justice Taney dissenting). Four concurring Justices in Ed-
wards v. California, 314 U.S. 160, 177, 181 (1941), would have grounded a right of
interstate travel on the privileges or immunities clause. More recently, the Court
declined to ascribe a source but was content to assert the right to be protected. United
States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 758 (1966); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629–31
(1969). Three Justices ascribed the source to this clause in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400
U.S. 112, 285–87 (1970) (Justices Stewart and Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger,
concurring in part and dissenting in part).
     22 Citing United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876).
     23 Citing Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884); Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58

(1900). Note Justice Douglas’ reliance on this clause in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S.
112, 149 (1970) (concurring in part and dissenting in part).
     24 Citing United States v. Waddell, 112 U.S. 76 (1884).
     25 Citing Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263 (1892).
     26 Citing In re Quarles and Butler, 158 U.S. 532 (1895).
     27 Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47, 57 (1891).
     28 Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U.S. 404 (1935), which was overruled five years later,

see Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U.S. 83, 93 (1940), represented the first attempt by
the Court since adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to convert the Privileges or
Immunities Clause into a source of protection of other than those “interests growing
out of the relationship between the citizen and the national government.” In Har-
vey, the Court declared that the right of a citizen to engage in lawful business in
other states, such as by entering into contracts or by loaning money, was a privilege
of national citizenship, and this privilege was abridged by a state income tax law
which excluded interest received on money from loans from taxable income only if
the loan was made within the state.
     29 307 U.S. 496, 510–18 (1939) (Justices Roberts and Black; Chief Justice Hughes

may or may not have concurred on this point. Id. at 532). Justices Stone and Reed
preferred to base the decision on the Due Process Clause. Id. at 518.
