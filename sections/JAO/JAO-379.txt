sion.1997 For example, in Califano v. Jobst,1998 a unanimous Court
sustained a Social Security provision that revoked disabled depen-
dents’ benefits of any person who married, except when the person
married someone who was also entitled to receive disabled depen-
dents’ benefits. Plaintiff, a recipient of such benefits, married some-
one who was also disabled but not qualified for the benefits, and
his benefits were terminated. He sued, alleging that distinguishing
between classes of persons who married eligible persons and who
married ineligible persons infringed upon his right to marry. The
Court rejected the argument, finding that benefit entitlement was
not based upon need but rather upon actual dependency upon the
insured wage earner; marriage, Congress could have assumed, gen-
erally terminates the dependency upon a parent-wage earner. There-
fore, it was permissible as an administrative convenience to make
marriage the terminating point but to make an exception when both
marriage partners were receiving benefits, as a means of lessening
hardship and recognizing that dependency was likely to continue.
The marriage rule was therefore not to be strictly scrutinized or
invalidated “simply because some persons who might otherwise have
married were deterred by the rule or because some who did marry
were burdened thereby.” 1999
    It seems obvious, therefore, that the determination of marriage
and familial relationships as fundamental will be a fruitful begin-
ning of litigation in the equal protection area.2000

sion giving benefits to a married woman under 62 with dependent children in her
care whose husband retires or becomes disabled but denying them to a divorced woman
under 62 with dependents represents a rational judgment by Congress with respect
to likely dependency of married but not divorced women and does not deny equal
protection); Califano v. Boles, 443 U.S. 282 (1979) (limitation of certain Social Secu-
rity benefits to widows and divorced wives of wage earners does not deprive mother
of illegitimate child who was never married to wage earner of equal protection).
      2000 See, e.g., Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246 (1978) (state’s giving to father of

legitimate child who is divorced or separated from mother while denying to father
of illegitimate child a veto over the adoption of the child by another does not under
the circumstances deny equal protection. The circumstances were that the father
never exercised custody over the child or shouldered responsibility for his supervi-
sion, education, protection, or care, although he had made some support payments
and given him presents). Accord, Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983).
