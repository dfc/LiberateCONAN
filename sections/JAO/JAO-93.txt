property, business done, or transactions carried on, within Califor-
nia, or as a tax on a privilege granted by that state.491

Procedure in Taxation
    Generally.—The Supreme Court has never decided exactly what
due process is required in the assessment and collection of general
taxes. Although the Court has held that “notice to the owner at some
stage of the proceedings, as well as an opportunity to defend, is es-
sential” for imposition of special taxes, it has also ruled that laws
for assessment and collection of general taxes stand upon a differ-
ent footing and are to be construed with the utmost liberality, even
to the extent of acknowledging that no notice whatever is neces-
sary.492 Due process of law as applied to taxation does not mean
judicial process; 493 neither does it require the same kind of notice
as is required in a suit at law, or even in proceedings for taking
private property under the power of eminent domain.494 Due pro-
cess is satisfied if a taxpayer is given an opportunity to test the
validity of a tax at any time before it is final, whether before a board
having a quasi-judicial character, or before a tribunal provided by
the state for such purpose.495
    Notice and Hearing in Relation to Taxes.—“Of the differ-
ent kinds of taxes which the State may impose, there is a vast num-
ber of which, from their nature, no notice can be given to the tax-
payer, nor would notice be of any possible advantage to him, such
as poll taxes, license taxes (not dependent upon the extent of his
business), and generally, specific taxes on things, or persons, or oc-
    491 Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77 (1938). When policy

loans to residents are made by a local agent of a foreign insurance company, in the
servicing of which notes are signed, security taken, interest collected, and debts are
paid within the State, such credits are taxable to the company, notwithstanding that
the promissory notes evidencing such credits are kept at the home office of the in-
surer. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. City of New Orleans, 205 U.S. 395 (1907). But
when a resident policyholder’s loan is merely charged against the reserve value of
his policy, under an arrangement for extinguishing the debt and interest thereon by
deduction from any claim under the policy, such credit is not taxable to the foreign
insurance company. Orleans Parish v. New York Life Ins. Co., 216 U.S. 517 (1910).
Premiums due from residents on which an extension has been granted by foreign
companies also are credits on which the latter may be taxed by the State of the
debtor’s domicile. Liverpool & L. & G. Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors, 221 U.S. 346
(1911). The mere fact that the insurers charge these premiums to local agents and
give no credit directly to policyholders does not enable them to escape this tax.
