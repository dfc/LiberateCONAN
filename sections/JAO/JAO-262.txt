regard to a “fundamental” interest, the traditional standard of equal
protection review is abandoned, and the Court exercises a “strict
scrutiny.” Under this standard government must demonstrate a high
degree of need, and usually little or no presumption favoring the
classification is to be expected. After much initial controversy within
the Court, it has now created a third category, finding several clas-
sifications to be worthy of a degree of “intermediate” scrutiny requir-
ing a showing of important governmental purposes and a close fit
between the classification and the purposes.
     Paradigmatic of “suspect” categories is classification by race. First
in the line of cases dealing with this issue is Korematsu v. United
States, 1401 concerning the wartime evacuation of Japanese-
Americans from the West Coast, in which the Court said that be-
cause only a single ethnic-racial group was involved the measure
was “immediately suspect” and subject to “rigid scrutiny.” The school
segregation cases 1402 purported to enunciate no per se rule, how-
ever, although subsequent summary treatment of a host of segrega-
tion measures may have implicitly done so, until in striking down
state laws prohibiting interracial marriage or cohabitation the Court
declared that racial classifications “bear a far heavier burden of jus-
tification” than other classifications and were invalid because no “over-
riding statutory purpose” 1403 was shown and they were not neces-
sary to some “legitimate overriding purpose.” 1404 “A racial classification,
regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid and can
be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.” 1405 Remedial
racial classifications, that is, the development of “affirmative ac-
tion” or similar programs that classify on the basis of race for the
purpose of ameliorating conditions resulting from past discrimina-
tion, are subject to more than traditional review scrutiny, but whether
the highest or some intermediate standard is the applicable test is
uncertain.1406 A measure that does not draw a distinction explicitly
on race but that does draw a line between those who seek to use
the law to do away with or modify racial discrimination and those

was deferential to the judgment of military authorities, and to congressional judg-

justify racial segregation there if shown to be necessary.
