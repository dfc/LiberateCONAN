tutions may be limited to those within the state.1501 In computing
the tax collectible from a nonresident decedent’s property within the
state, a state may apply the pertinent rates to the whole estate wher-
ever located and take that proportion thereof which the property
within the state bears to the total; the fact that a greater tax may
result than would be assessed on an equal amount of property if
owned by a resident, does not invalidate the result.1502
     Motor Vehicle Taxes.—In demanding compensation for the use
of highways, a state may exempt certain types of vehicles, accord-
ing to the purpose for which they are used, from a mileage tax on
carriers.1503 A state maintenance tax act, which taxes vehicle prop-
erty carriers for hire at greater rates than it taxes similar vehicles
carrying property not for hire, is reasonable, because the use of roads
by one hauling not for hire generally is limited to transportation of
his own property as an incident to his occupation and is substan-
tially less extensive than that of one engaged in business as a com-
mon carrier.1504 A property tax on motor vehicles used in operating
a stage line that makes constant and unusual use of the highways
may be measured by gross receipts and be assessed at a higher rate
than are taxes on property not so employed.1505 Common motor car-
riers of freight operating over regular routes between fixed termini
may be taxed at higher rates than other carriers, common and pri-
vate.1506 A fee for the privilege of transporting motor vehicles on
their own wheels over the highways of the state for purpose of sale
does not violate the Equal Protection Clause as applied to cars mov-
ing in caravans.1507 The exemption from a tax for a permit to bring
cars into the state in caravans of cars moved for sale between zones
in the state is not an unconstitutional discrimination where it ap-
pears that the traffic subject to the tax places a much more serious
burden on the highways than that which is exempt from the tax.1508
Also sustained as valid have been exemptions of vehicles weighing
less than 3,000 pounds from graduated registration fees imposed
on carriers for hire, notwithstanding that the exempt vehicles, when
loaded, may outweigh those taxed; 1509 and exemptions from ve-
hicle registration and license fees levied on private carriers operat-
ing a motor vehicle in the business of transporting persons or prop-
