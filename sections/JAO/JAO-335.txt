cies among the Justices both to lessen and to increase the burden
of governmental justification of sex classifications.
     In Reed v. Reed,1806 the Court held invalid a state probate law
that gave males preference over females when both were equally
entitled to administer an estate. Because the statute “provides that
different treatment be accorded to the applicants on the basis of
their sex,” Chief Justice Burger wrote, “it thus establishes a classi-
fication subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” The
Court proceeded to hold that under traditional equal protection stan-
dards—requiring a classification to be reasonable and not arbi-
trarily related to a lawful objective—the classification made was an
arbitrary way to achieve the objective the state advanced in de-
fense of the law, that is, to reduce the area of controversy between
otherwise equally qualified applicants for administration. Thus, the
Court used traditional analysis but the holding seems to go some-
what further to say that not all lawful interests of a state may be
advanced by a classification based solely on sex.1807
    It is now established that sex classifications, in order to with-
stand equal protection scrutiny, “must serve important governmen-
tal objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of
those objectives.” 1808 Thus, after several years in which sex distinc-
tions were more often voided than sustained without a clear state-
ment of the standard of review,1809 a majority of the Court has ar-

    1806  404 U.S. 71 (1971).
    1807  404 U.S. at 75–77. Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 447 n.7 (1972). A
statute similar to that in Reed was before the Court in Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450
U.S. 455 (1981) (invalidating statute giving husband unilateral right to dispose of
jointly owned community property without wife’s consent).
     1808 Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199,

210–11 (1977) (plurality opinion); Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316–317 (1977);
Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 279 (1979); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 388 (1979);
Massachusetts Personnel Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979); Califano v. Westcott,
443 U.S. 76, 85 (1979); Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150
(1980); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981); Mississippi Univ. for Women
v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 723–24 (1982). But see Michael M. v. Superior Court, 450
U.S. 464, 468–69 (1981) (plurality opinion); id. at 483 (Justice Blackmun concur-
ring); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 69–72 (1981). The test is the same whether
women or men are disadvantaged by the classification, Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. at 279;
Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. at 394; Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458
U.S. at 724, although Justice Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger strongly argued
that when males are disadvantaged only the rational basis test is appropriate. Craig
v. Boren, 429 U.S. at 217, 218–21; Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. at 224. That adop-
tion of a standard has not eliminated difficulty in deciding such cases should be evi-
dent by perusal of the cases following.
     1809 In Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), four Justices were pre-

pared to hold that sex classifications are inherently suspect and must therefore be
subjected to strict scrutiny. Id. at 684–87 (Justices Brennan, Douglas, White, and
Marshall). Three Justices, reaching the same result, thought the statute failed the
traditional test and declined for the moment to consider whether sex was a suspect
