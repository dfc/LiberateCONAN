the right to effective assistance of counsel.2028
    But, deciding a point left unresolved in Douglas, the Court held
that neither the Due Process nor the Equal Protection Clause re-
quires a state to furnish counsel to a convicted defendant seeking,
after he had exhausted his appeals of right, to obtain discretionary
review of his case in the state’s higher courts or in the United States
Supreme Court. Due process does not require that, after an appeal
has been provided, the state must always provide counsel to indigents
at every stage. “Unfairness results only if indigents are singled out
by the State and denied meaningful access to that system because
of their poverty.” That essentially equal protection issue was de-
cided against the defendant in the context of an appellate system
in which one appeal could be taken as of right to an intermediate
court, with counsel provided if necessary, and in which further ap-
peals might be granted not primarily upon any conclusion about
the result below but upon considerations of significant impor-
tance.2029 Not even death row inmates have a constitutional right

    This right to legal assistance, especially in the context of the
constitutional right to the writ of habeas corpus, means that in the
absence of other adequate assistance, as through a functioning pub-

(1967); Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Entsminger v. Iowa, 386 U.S. 748
(1967). A rule requiring a court-appointed appellate counsel to file a brief explaining
reasons why he concludes that a client’s appeal is frivolous does not violate the cli-
ent’s right to assistance of counsel on appeal. McCoy v. Court of Appeals, 486 U.S.
429 (1988). The right is violated if the court allows counsel to withdraw by merely
certifying that the appeal is “meritless” without also filing an Anders brief support-
ing the certification. Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988). But see Smith v. Robbins,
528 U.S. 259 (2000) (upholding California law providing that appellate counsel may
limit his or her role to filing a brief summarizing the case and record and request-
ing the court to examine record for non-frivolous issues). On the other hand, since
there is no constitutional right to counsel for indigent prisoners seeking postconvic-
tion collateral relief, there is no requirement that withdrawal be justified in an Anders
brief if a state has provided counsel for postconviction proceedings. Pennsylvania v.
Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987) (counsel advised the court that there were no arguable
bases for collateral relief).

(1974) (statute providing, under circumscribed conditions, that indigent defendant,
who receives state-compensated counsel and other assistance for his defense, who is
convicted, and who subsequently becomes able to repay costs, must reimburse state
for costs of his defense in no way operates to deny him assistance of counsel or the
equal protection of the laws).

which “unit attorneys” assigned to prisons are available for some advice prior to the
filing of a claim, and a personal attorney is assigned if an inmate succeeds in filing
a petition with at least one non-frivolous claim).
