putes about the possession of that property would also support ju-
risdiction, as would the likelihood that important records and witnesses
will be found in the State.” 917 Thus, for “true” in rem actions, the
old results are likely to still prevail.
    Quasi in Rem: Attachment Proceedings.—If a defendant is
neither domiciled nor present in a state, he cannot be served per-
sonally, and any judgment in money obtained against him would
be unenforceable. This does not, however, prevent attachment of a
defendant’s property within the state. The practice of allowing a state
to attach a non-resident’s real and personal property situated within
its borders to satisfy a debt or other claim by one of its citizens
goes back to colonial times. Attachment is considered a form of in
rem proceeding sometimes called “quasi in rem,” and under Pen-
noyer v. Neff 918 an attachment could be implemented by obtaining
a writ against the local property of the defendant and giving notice
by publication.919 The judgement was then satisfied from the prop-
erty attached, and if the attached property was insufficient to sat-
isfy the claim, the plaintiff could go no further.920
    This form of proceeding raised many questions. Of course, there
were always instances in which it was fair to subject a person to
suit on his property located in the forum state, such as where the
property was related to the matter sued over.921 In others, the ques-
tion was more disputed, as in the famous New York Court of Ap-
peals case of Seider v. Roth,922 in which the property subject to at-
tachment was the contractual obligation of the defendant’s insurance
     917 433 U.S. at 207–08 (footnotes omitted). The Court also suggested that the

state would usually have jurisdiction in cases such as those arising from injuries
suffered on the property of an absentee owner, where the defendant’s ownership of
the property is conceded but the cause of action is otherwise related to rights and
duties growing out of that controversy. Id.

     919 The theory was that property is always in possession of an owner, and that

seizure of the property will inform him. This theory of notice was disavowed sooner
than the theory of jurisdiction. See “Actions in Rem: Proceedings Against Property”,
supra.
     920 Other, quasi in rem actions, which are directed against persons, but ulti-

mately have property as the subject matter, such as probate, Goodrich v. Ferris, 214
U.S. 71, 80 (1909), and garnishment of foreign attachment proceedings, Pennington
v. Fourth Nat’l Bank, 243 U.S. 269, 271 (1917); Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905),
might also be prosecuted to conclusion without requiring the presence of all parties
in interest. The jurisdictional requirements for rendering a valid divorce decree are
considered under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. I, § 1.
