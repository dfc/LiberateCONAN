    Previously, the Court’s decisions with respect to state “involve-
ment” in the private activities of individuals and entities raised the
question whether financial assistance and tax benefits provided to
private parties would so clothe them with state action that discrimi-
nation by them and other conduct would be subject to constitu-
tional constraints. Many lower courts had held state action to exist
in such circumstances.1343 However the question might have been
answered under prior Court holdings, it is evident that the more
recent cases would not generally support a finding of state action
in these cases. In Rendell-Baker v. Kohn,1344 a private school re-
ceived “problem” students referred to it by public institutions, it was
heavily regulated, and it received between 90 and 99% of its oper-
ating budget from public funds. In Blum v. Yaretsky,1345 a nursing
home had practically all of its operating and capital costs subsi-
dized by public funds and more than 90% of its residents had their
medical expenses paid from public funds; in setting reimbursement
rates, the state included a formula to assure the home a profit. Nev-
ertheless, in both cases the Court found that the entities remained
private, and required plaintiffs to show that as to the complained
of actions the state was involved, either through coercion or encour-
agement.1346 “That programs undertaken by the State result in sub-
stantial funding of the activities of a private entity is no more per-

     1346 The rules developed by the Court for general business regulation are that

(1) the “mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself
convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment,” Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982) quoting Jackson v. Metropolitan
Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 350 (1974); Cf. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163
(1972), and (2) “a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only
when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encourage-
ment, either overt or covert, that the choice must be deemed to be that of the State.”
Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982). To the latter point, see Flagg Bros. v.
Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 166 (1978); Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345,
357 (1974).
