in Ben Avon concluded that the Pennsylvania “Supreme Court in-
terpreted the statute as withholding from the courts power to deter-
mine the question of confiscation according to their own indepen-
dent judgment . . . .” 175 Largely on the strength of this interpretation
of the applicable state statute, the Court held that, when the order
of a legislature, or of a commission, prescribing a schedule of maxi-
mum future rates is challenged as confiscatory, “the State must pro-
vide a fair opportunity for submitting that issue to a judicial tribu-
nal for determination upon its own independent judgment as to both
law and facts; otherwise the order is void because in conflict with
the due process clause, Fourteenth Amendment.” 176
    History of the Valuation Question.—For almost fifty years
the Court wandered through a maze of conflicting formulas and fac-
tors for valuing public service corporation property, including “fair
value,” 177 “reproduction cost,” 178 “prudent investment,” 179 “depre-


     175 253 U.S. at 289 (the “question of confiscation” was the question whether the

rates set by the Public Service Commission were so low as to constitute confisca-
tion). Unlike previous confiscatory rate litigation, which had developed from rulings
of lower federal courts in injunctive proceedings, this case reached the Supreme Court
by way of appeal from a state appellate tribunal. In injunctive proceedings, evi-
dence is freshly introduced, whereas in the cases received on appeal from state courts,
the evidence is found within the record.
     176 253 U.S. at 289. Without departing from the ruling previously enunciated in

Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, 231 U.S. 298 (1913), that the failure of a
state to grant a statutory right of judicial appeal from a commission’s regulation
does not violate due process as long as relief is obtainable by a bill in equity for
injunction, the Court also held that the alternative remedy of injunction expressly
provided by state law did not afford an adequate opportunity for testing a confisca-
tory rate order. It conceded the principle stressed by the dissenting Justices that,
“[w]here a State offers a litigant the choice of two methods of judicial review, of which
one is both appropriate and unrestricted, the mere fact that the other which the
litigant elects is limited, does not amount to a denial of the constitutional right to a
judicial review.” 253 U.S. at 295.
     177 Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S. 466, 546–47 (1898) (“fair value” necessitated consid-

eration of original cost of construction, permanent improvements, amount and mar-
ket value of bonds and stock, replacement cost, probable earning capacity, and oper-
ating expenses).
     178 Various valuation cases emphasized reproduction costs, i.e., the present as

compared with the original cost of construction. See, e.g., San Diego Land Co. v. Na-
tional City, 174 U.S. 739, 757 (1899); San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, 189
U.S. 439, 443 (1903).
     179 Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 262 U.S.

276, 291–92, 302, 306–07 (1923) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (cost includes both oper-
ating expenses and capital charges, i.e., interest for the use of capital, allowance for
the risk incurred, funds to attract capital). This method would require “adoption of
the amount prudently invested as the rate base and the amount of the capital charge
as the measure of the rate of return.” As a method of valuation, the prudent invest-
ment theory was not accorded any acceptance until the Depression of the 1930s.
The sharp decline in prices that occurred during this period doubtless contributed
to the loss of affection for reproduction costs. In Los Angeles Gas Co. v. Railroad
