fact insofar as such findings were supported by substantial evi-
dence. For instance, in San Diego Land Company v. National City,171
the Court declared that “the courts cannot, after [a legislative body]
has fairly and fully investigated and acted, by fixing what it be-
lieves to be reasonable rates, step in and say its action shall be set
aside and nullified because the courts, upon a similar investiga-
tion, have come to a different conclusion as to the reasonableness
of the rates fixed. . . . [J]udicial interference should never occur un-
less the case presents, clearly and beyond all doubt, such a fla-
grant attack upon the rights of property under the guise of regula-
tions as to compel the court to say that the rates prescribed will
necessarily have the effect to deny just compensation for private
property taken for the public use.” And, later, in a similar case,172
the Court expressed even more clearly its reluctance to reexamine
ordinary factual determinations, writing, “we do not feel bound to
reexamine and weigh all the evidence . . . or to proceed according
to our independent opinion as to what were proper rates. It is enough
if we cannot say that it was impossible for a fair-minded board to
come to the result which was reached.” 173
    These standards of review were, however, abruptly rejected by
the Court in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough 174 as be-
ing no longer sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process,
ushering in a long period during which courts substantively evalu-
ated the reasonableness of rate settings. The U.S. Supreme Court

Shepard), 230 U.S. 352, 433 (1913).

      173 Moreover, in reviewing orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the

Court, at least in earlier years, chose to be guided by approximately the same stan-
dards it had originally formulated for examining regulations of state commissions.
The following excerpt from its holding in ICC v. Union Pacific R.R., 222 U.S. 541,
547–48 (1912) represents an adequate summation of the law as it stood prior to
1920: “[Q]uestions of fact may be involved in the determination of questions of law,
so that an order, regular on its face, may be set aside if it appears that . . . the rate
is so low as to be confiscatory . . . ; or if the Commission acted so arbitrarily and
unjustly as to fix rates contrary to evidence, or without evidence to support it; or
. . . if the authority therein involved has been exercised in such an unreasonable
manner as to cause it to be within the elementary rule that the substance, and not
the shadow, determines the validity of the exercise of the power. . . . In determin-
ing these mixed questions of law and fact, the court confines itself to the ultimate
question as to whether the Commission acted within its power. It will not consider
the expediency or wisdom of the order, or whether, on like testimony, it would have
made a similar ruling . . . [The Commission’s] conclusion, of course, is subject to
review, but when supported by evidence is accepted as final; not that its decision
. . . can be supported by a mere scintilla of proof—but the courts will not examine
the facts further than to determine whether there was substantial evidence to sus-
tain the order.” See also ICC v. Illinois Cent. R.R., 215 U.S. 452, 470 (1910).
