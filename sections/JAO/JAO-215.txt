     The Court held in Ford v. Wainwright that the Eighth Amend-
ment prohibits the state from executing a person who is insane, and
that properly raised issues of pre-execution sanity must be deter-
mined in a proceeding that satisfies the requirements of due pro-
cess.1146 Due process is not met when the decision on sanity is left
to the unfettered discretion of the governor; rather, due process re-
quires the opportunity to be heard before an impartial officer or
board.1147 The Court, however, left “to the State[s] the task of devel-
oping appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon
its execution of sentences.” 1148
     In Atkins v. Virginia, the Court held that the Eighth Amend-
ment also prohibits the state from executing a person who is men-
tally retarded, and added, “As was our approach in Ford v. Wain-
wright with regard to insanity, ‘we leave to the State[s] the task of
developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restric-
tion upon [their] execution of sentences.’ ” 1149
     Issues of substantive due process may arise if the government
seeks to compel the medication of a person found to be incompe-
tent to stand trial. In Washington v. Harper,1150 the Court had found
that an individual has a significant “liberty interest” in avoiding
the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs. In Sell v. United
States,1151 the Court found that this liberty interest could in “rare”
instances be outweighed by the government’s interest in bringing
an incompetent individual to trial. First, however, the government
must engage in a fact-specific inquiry as to whether this interest is

    1147  There was no opinion of the Court on the issue of procedural requirements.
Justice Marshall, joined by Justices Brennan, Blackmun, and Stevens, would hold
that “the ascertainment of a prisoner’s sanity calls for no less stringent standards
than those demanded in any other aspect of a capital proceeding.” 477 U.S. at 411–
12. Concurring Justice Powell thought that due process might be met by a proceed-
ing “far less formal than a trial,” that the state “should provide an impartial officer
or board that can receive evidence and argument from the prisoner’s counsel.” Id. at
427. Concurring Justice O’Connor, joined by Justice White, emphasized Florida’s de-
nial of the opportunity to be heard, and did not express an opinion on whether the
state could designate the governor as decisionmaker. Thus Justice Powell’s opinion,
requiring the opportunity to be heard before an impartial officer or board, sets forth
the Court’s holding.
     1148 477 U.S. at 416–17.
     1149 536 U.S. at 317 (citation omitted), quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399,

416–17 (1986). The Court quoted this language again in Schriro v. Smith, holding
that “[t]he Ninth Circuit erred in commanding the Arizona courts to conduct a jury
trial to resolve Smith’s mental retardation claim.” 546 U.S. 6, 7 (2005) (per curiam).
States, the Court added, are entitled to “adopt[ ] their own measures for adjudicat-
ing claims of mental retardation,” though “those measures might, in their applica-
tion, be subject to constitutional challenge.” Id.
     1150 494 U.S. 210 (1990) (prison inmate could be drugged against his will if he

presented a risk of serious harm to himself or others).
