the Court indicated that the time was running out for full imple-
mentation of the Brown mandate.1610
    About this time, “freedom of choice” plans were promulgated un-
der which each child in the school district could choose each year
which school he wished to attend, and, subject to space limitations,
he could attend that school. These were first approved by the lower
courts as acceptable means to implement desegregation, subject to
the reservation that they be fairly administered.1611 Enactment of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and HEW enforcement in a
manner as to require effective implementation of affirmative ac-
tions to desegregate 1612 led to a change of attitude in the lower courts
and the Supreme Court. In Green v. School Board of New Kent
County,1613 the Court posited the principle that the only desegrega-
tion plan permissible is one which actually results in the abolition
of the dual school, and charged school officials with an affirmative
obligation to achieve it. School boards must present to the district
courts “a plan that promises realistically to work and promises re-
alistically to work now,” in such a manner as “to convert promptly
to a system without a ‘white’ school and a ‘Negro’ school, but just
schools.” 1614 Furthermore, as the Court and lower courts had by then
made clear, school desegregation encompassed not only the aboli-

     1610 The first comment appeared in dictum in a nonschool case, Watson v. City

of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 530 (1963), and was implied in Goss v. Board of Educ. of
City of Knoxville, 373 U.S. 683, 689 (1963). In Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Rich-
mond, 382 U.S. 103, 105 (1965), the Court announced that “[d]elays in desegregat-
ing school systems are no longer tolerable.” A grade-a-year plan was implicitly dis-
approved in Calhoun v. Latimer, 377 U.S. 263 (1964), vacating and remanding 321
F.2d 302 (5th Cir. 1963). See Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist.,
355 F.2d 865 (5th Cir. 1966).
     1611 E.g., Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Richmond, 345 F.2d 310 (4th Cir.), rev’d

on other grounds, 382 U.S. 103 (1965); Bowman v. School Bd. of Charles City County,
382 F.2d 326 (4th Cir. 1967).
     1612 Pub. L. 88–352, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq. (prohibiting discrimi-

nation in federally assisted programs). HEW guidelines were designed to afford guid-
ance to state and local officials in interpretations of the law and were accepted as
authoritative by the courts and used. Davis v. Board of School Comm’rs of Mobile
County, 364 F.2d 896 (5th Cir. 1966); Kemp v. Beasley, 352 F.2d 14 (8th Cir. 1965).
     1613 391 U.S. 430 (1968); Raney v. Gould Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 443 (1968). These

cases had been preceded by a circuit-wide promulgation of similar standards in United
States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), modified and
aff’d, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840 (1967).
     1614 Green, 391 U.S. at 439, 442 (1968). “Brown II was a call for the disman-

tling of well-entrenched dual systems tempered by an awareness that complex and
multifaceted problems would arise which would require time and flexibility for a
successful resolution. School boards such as the respondent then operating state-
compelled dual systems were nevertheless clearly charged with the affirmative duty
to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which
racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.” Id. at 437–38. The case
laid to rest the dictum of Briggs v. Elliott, 132 F. Supp. 776, 777 (E.D.S.C. 1955),
that the Constitution “does not require integration” but “merely forbids discrimina-
