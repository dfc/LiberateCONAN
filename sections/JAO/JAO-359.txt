the registered voters lived in the 49 most populous counties.1894 But
to provide that the candidates of any political organization obtain-
ing 20% or more of the vote in the last gubernatorial or presiden-
tial election may obtain a ballot position simply by winning the par-
ty’s primary election, while requiring candidates of other parties or
independent candidates to obtain the signatures of less than five
percent of those eligible to vote at the last election for the office
sought, is not to discriminate unlawfully, because the state placed
no barriers of any sort in the way of obtaining signatures and be-
cause write-in votes were also freely permitted.1895
     Reviewing under the strict test the requirements for qualifica-
tion of new parties and independent candidates for ballot positions,
the Court recognized as valid objectives and compelling interests
the protection of the integrity of the nominating and electing pro-
cess, the promotion of party stability, and the assurance of a modi-
cum of order in regulating the size of the ballot by requiring a show-
ing of some degree of support for independents and new parties before
they can get on the ballot.1896 “[T]o comply with the First and Four-
teenth Amendments the State must provide a feasible opportunity
for new political organizations and their candidates to appear on
the ballot.” 1897 Decision whether or not a state statutory structure
affords a feasible opportunity is a matter of degree, “very much a
matter of ‘consider[ing] the facts and circumstances behind the law,
the interest which the State claims to be protecting, and the inter-
est of those who are disadvantaged by the classification.’ ” 1898
     Thus, in order to assure that parties seeking ballot space com-
mand a significant, measurable quantum of community support, Texas
was upheld in treating different parties in ways rationally con-
structed to achieve this objective. Candidates of parties whose gu-
bernatorial choice polled more than 200,000 votes in the last gen-
eral election had to be nominated by primary elections and went
on the ballot automatically, because the prior vote adequately dem-
onstrated support. Candidates whose parties polled less than 200,000
but more than 2 percent could be nominated in primary elections
