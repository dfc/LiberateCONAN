vision requiring the attending physician to exercise all care and
diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus without regard
to the stage of viability was inconsistent with Roe.581 The Court sus-
tained provisions that required the woman’s written consent to an
abortion with assurances that it is informed and freely given, and
the Court also upheld mandatory reporting and recordkeeping for
public health purposes with adequate assurances of confidentiality.
Another provision that barred the use of the most commonly used
method of abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was de-
clared unconstitutional because, in the absence of another compara-
bly safe technique, it did not qualify as a reasonable protection of
maternal health and it instead operated to deny the vast majority
of abortions after the first 12 weeks.582
     In other rulings applying Roe, the Court struck down some re-
quirements and upheld others. A requirement that all abortions per-
formed after the first trimester be performed in a hospital was in-
validated as imposing “a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women’s
access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and [at least
during the first few weeks of the second trimester] safe abortion
procedure.” 583 The Court held, however, that a state may require
that abortions be performed in hospitals or licensed outpatient clin-
ics, as long as licensing standards do not “depart from accepted medi-
cal practice.” 584 Various “informed consent” requirements were struck
hold that if parental consent is required the state must afford an expeditious access
to court to review the parental determination and set it aside in appropriate cases.
In H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398 (1981), the Court upheld, as applied to an
unemancipated minor living at home and dependent on her parents, a statute requir-
ing a physician, “if possible,” to notify the parents or guardians of a minor seeking
an abortion. The decisions leave open a variety of questions, addressed by some con-
curring and dissenting Justices, dealing with when it would not be in the minor’s
best interest to avoid notifying her parents and with the alternatives to parental
notification and consent. In two 1983 cases the Court applied the Bellotti v. Baird
standard for determining whether judicial substitutes for parental consent require-
ments permit a pregnant minor to demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to
make her own decision on abortion. Compare City of Akron v. Akron Center for Re-
productive Health, 462 U.S. 416 (1983) (no opportunity for case-by-case determina-
tions); with Planned Parenthood Ass’n v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476 (1983) (adequate
individualized consideration).
     581 Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 81–84 (1976). A law requiring

a doctor, subject to penal sanction, to determine if a fetus is viable or may be viable
and to take steps to preserve the life and health of viable fetuses was held to be
unconstitutionally vague. Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979).
     582 Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 75–79 (1976).
     583 City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 438

(1983); Accord, Planned Parenthood Ass’n v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476 (1983). The Court
in Akron relied on evidence that “dilation and evacuation” (D&E) abortions per-
formed in clinics cost less than half as much as hospital abortions, and that com-
mon use of the D&E procedure had “increased dramatically” the safety of second
trimester abortions in the 10 years since Roe v. Wade. 462 U.S. at 435–36.
     584 Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506, 516 (1983).
