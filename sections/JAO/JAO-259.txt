tion, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated
alike.” 1386 Use of the latter standard did in fact result in some in-
validations.1387
     But then, coincident with the demise of substantive due pro-
cess in the area of economic regulation,1388 the Court reverted to
the former standard, deferring to the legislative judgment on ques-
tions of economics and related matters; even when an impermis-
sible purpose could have been attributed to the classifiers it was
usually possible to conceive of a reason that would justify the clas-
sification.1389 Strengthening the deference was the recognition of dis-
cretion in the legislature not to try to deal with an evil or a class
of evils all within the scope of one enactment but to approach the
problem piecemeal, to learn from experience, and to ameliorate the
harmful results of two evils differently, resulting in permissible over-
and under-inclusive classifications.1390
    In recent years, the Court has been remarkably inconsistent in
setting forth the standard which it is using, and the results have

a tax on the out-of-state income of domestic corporations that did business in the
state, when domestic corporations that engaged only in out-of-state business were
exempted); Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, 294 U.S. 550 (1935) (striking down a

     1388 In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 537 (1934), speaking of the limits of

the Due Process Clause, the Court observed that “in the absence of other constitu-
tional restrictions, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably
be deemed to promote public welfare.”
     1389 E.g., Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141 (1940) (exclusion of agriculture and live-

stock from price-fixing statute justified by heightened concerns surrounding concen-
trations of power in other industries); Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm’rs,

license, allowing river pilots to apprentice mostly friends and relatives justified upon
desire to create a cohesive piloting community); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464
(1948) (court will not question legislature’s determination that allowing women to
bartend gives rise to moral and social problems, but that such problems are re-

press Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949) (upholding ban on advertising on the

could determine that the nature and extent of the distraction presented by the lat-
ter advertising did not present the same threat to traffic); McGowan v. Maryland,
366 U.S. 420 (1961) (allowing the sale of certain products on Sunday, while prohib-
