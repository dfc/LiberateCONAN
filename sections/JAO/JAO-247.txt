the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State
itself.” 1315 Or, to quote Judge Friendly, who first enunciated the test
this way, the “essential point” is “that the state must be involved
not simply with some activity of the institution alleged to have in-
flicted injury upon a plaintiff but with the activity that caused the
injury. Putting the point another way, the state action, not the pri-
vate action, must be the subject of the complaint.” 1316 Therefore,
the Court found no such nexus between the state and a public utili-
ty’s action in terminating service to a customer. Neither the fact
that the business was subject to state regulation, nor that the state
had conferred in effect a monopoly status upon the utility, nor that
in reviewing the company’s tariff schedules the regulatory commis-
sion had in effect approved the termination provision (but had not
required the practice, had “not put its own weight on the side of
the proposed practice by ordering it”) 1317 operated to make the utili-
ty’s action the state’s action.1318 Significantly tightening the stan-
dard further against a finding of “state action,” the Court asserted
that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party “acted
under color of the challenged statute, but also that its actions are
properly attributable to the State. . . .” 1319 And the actions are to
be attributable to the state apparently only if the state compelled
the actions and not if the state merely established the process through
statute or regulation under which the private party acted.
     Thus, when a private party, having someone’s goods in his pos-
session and seeking to recover the charges owned on storage of the
goods, acts under a permissive state statue to sell the goods and
retain his charges out of the proceeds, his actions are not govern-

lege athletic association’s activities, the application of association rules leading to a
state university’s suspending its basketball coach could not be ascribed to the state.).
But see Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assoc., 531 U.S.
288 (2001) (where statewide public school scholastic association is “overwhelmingly”
composed of public school officials for that state, this “entwinement” is sufficient to
ascribe actions of association to state).

Justice Marshall protested that the quoted language marked “a sharp departure”
from precedent, “that state authorization and approval of ‘private’ conduct has been
held to support a finding of state action.” Id. at 369. In Cantor v. Detroit Edison
Co., 428 U.S. 579 (1976), the plurality opinion used much the same analysis to deny
antitrust immunity to a utility practice merely approved but not required by the
regulating commission, but most of the Justices were on different sides of the same
question in the two cases.
