not deny a defendant due process to subject him initially to trial
before a non-lawyer police court judge when there is a later trial
de novo available under the state’s court system.1082
    Prosecutorial Misconduct.—When a conviction is obtained by
the presentation of testimony known to the prosecuting authorities
to have been perjured, due process is violated. The clause “cannot
be deemed to be satisfied by mere notice and hearing if a State has
contrived a conviction through the pretense of a trial which in truth
is but used as a means of depriving a defendant of liberty through
a deliberate deception of court and jury by the presentation of tes-
timony known to be perjured. Such a contrivance . . . is as incon-
sistent with the rudimentary demands of justice as is the obtain-
ing of a like result by intimidation.” 1083
    The above-quoted language was dictum,1084 but the principle it
enunciated has required state officials to controvert allegations that
knowingly false testimony had been used to convict 1085 and has up-
set convictions found to have been so procured.1086 Extending the

ness of the confession); Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006) (overturning
rule that evidence of third-party guilt can be excluded if there is strong forensic
evidence establishing defendant’s culpability). But see Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S.
37 (1996) (state may bar defendant from introducing evidence of intoxication to prove
lack of mens rea).
     1082 North v. Russell, 427 U.S. 328 (1976).
     1083 Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935).
     1084 The Court dismissed the petitioner’s suit on the ground that adequate pro-

cess existed in the state courts to correct any wrong and that petitioner had not
availed himself of it. A state court subsequently appraised the evidence and ruled
that the allegations had not been proved in Ex parte Mooney, 10 Cal. 2d 1, 73 P.2d
554 (1937), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 598 (1938).
     1085 Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213 (1942); White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760 (1945).

See also New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, 318 U.S. 688 (1943); Ex parte Hawk,
321 U.S. 114 (1914). But see Hysler v. Florida, 315 U.S. 411 (1942); Lisenba v. Cali-
fornia, 314 U.S. 219 (1941).
     1086 Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959); Alcorta v. Texas, 355 U.S. 28 (1957).

In the former case, the principal prosecution witness was defendant’s accomplice,
and he testified that he had received no promise of consideration in return for his
testimony. In fact, the prosecutor had promised him consideration, but did nothing
to correct the false testimony. See also Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)
(same). In the latter case, involving a husband’s killing of his wife because of her
infidelity, a prosecution witness testified at the habeas corpus hearing that he told
the prosecutor that he had been intimate with the woman but that the prosecutor
had told him to volunteer nothing of it, so that at trial he had testified his relation-
ship with the woman was wholly casual. In both cases, the Court deemed it irrel-
evant that the false testimony had gone only to the credibility of the witness rather
than to the defendant’s guilt. What if the prosecution should become aware of the
perjury of a prosecution witness following the trial? Cf. Durley v. Mayo, 351 U.S.
277 (1956). But see Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 218–21 (1982) (prosecutor’s fail-
ure to disclose that one of the jurors has a job application pending before him, thus
rendering him possibly partial, does not go to fairness of the trial and due process
is not violated).
