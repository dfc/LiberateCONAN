Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.” 1006 Whether the Court
will now limit the doctrine to the detriment area only, exclusive of
benefit programs, whether it will limit it to those areas which in-
volve fundamental rights or suspect classifications (in the equal pro-
tection sense of those expressions) 1007 or whether it will simply per-
mit the doctrine to pass from the scene remains unsettled, but it is
noteworthy that it now rarely appears on the Court’s docket.1008
     Trials and Appeals.—Trial by jury in civil trials, unlike the
case in criminal trials, has not been deemed essential to due pro-
cess, and the Fourteenth Amendment has not been held to restrain
the states in retaining or abolishing civil juries.1009 Thus, abolition
of juries in proceedings to enforce liens,1010 mandamus 1011 and quo
warranto 1012 actions, and in eminent domain 1013 and equity 1014 pro-
ceedings has been approved. states are also free to adopt innova-
tions respecting selection and number of jurors. Verdicts rendered
by ten out of twelve jurors may be substituted for the requirement
of unanimity,1015 and petit juries containing eight rather than the
conventional number of twelve members may be established.1016

does not require a state to provide appellate review.1017 But if an

    1007  Vlandis, which was approved but distinguished, is only marginally in this
doctrinal area, involving as it does a right to travel feature, but it is like Salfi and
Murry in its benefit context and order of presumption. The Court has avoided decid-
ing whether to overrule, retain, or further limit Vlandis. Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U.S.

     1008 In Turner v. Department of Employment Security, 423 U.S. 44 (1975), de-

cided after Salfi, the Court voided under the doctrine a statute making pregnant
women ineligible for unemployment compensation for a period extending from 12
weeks before the expected birth until six weeks after childbirth. But see Usery v.
Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1 (1977) (provision granting benefits to min-
ers “irrebuttably presumed” to be disabled is merely a way of giving benefits to all
those with the condition triggering the presumption); Califano v. Boles, 443 U.S. 282,
284–85 (1979) (Congress must fix general categorization; case-by-case determina-
tion would be prohibitively costly).
