eral welfare, to conclude that a woman should be relieved from the
civic duty of jury service unless she herself determines that such
service is consistent with her own special responsibilities.” 1800 An-
other type of protective legislation for women that was sustained
by the Court is that premised on protection of morals, as by forbid-
ding the sale of liquor to women.1801 In a highly controversial rul-
ing, the Court sustained a state law that forbade the licensing of
any female bartender, except for the wives or daughters of male own-
ers. The Court purported to view the law as one for the protection
of the health and morals of women generally, with the exception
being justified by the consideration that such women would be un-
der the eyes of a protective male.1802
     A wide variety of sex discrimination by governmental and pri-
vate parties, including sex discrimination in employment and even
the protective labor legislation previously sustained, is now pro-
scribed by federal law. In addition, federal law requires equal pay
for equal work.1803 Some states have followed suit.1804 While the pro-
posed Equal Rights Amendment was before the states and ulti-
mately failed to be ratified,1805 the Supreme Court undertook a ma-
jor evaluation of sex classification doctrine, first applying a “heightened”
traditional standard of review (with bite) to void a discrimination
and then, after coming within a vote of making sex a suspect clas-
sification, settling upon an intermediate standard. These standards
continue, with some uncertainties of application and some tenden-

     1802 Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948).
     1803 Thus, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 80 Stat. 662, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e

et seq., bans discrimination against either sex in employment. See, e.g., Phillips v.
Martin-Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971); Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321
(1977); Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978); Ari-
zona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Plans v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073 (1983) (actuari-
ally based lower monthly retirement benefits for women employees violates Title VII);
Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986) (“hostile environment” sex ha-
rassment claim is actionable). Reversing rulings that pregnancy discrimination is
not reached by the statutory bar on sex discrimination, General Electric Co. v. Gil-
bert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976); Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136 (1977), Congress
enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Pub. L. 95–555 (1978), 92 Stat. 2076,
amending 42 U.S.C. § 2000e. The Equal Pay Act, 77 Stat. 56 (1963), amending the
Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d), generally applies to wages paid for
work requiring “equal skill, effort, and responsibility.” See Corning Glass Works v.
Brennan, 417 U.S. 188 (1974). On the controversial issue of “comparable worth” and
the interrelationship of title VII and the Equal Pay Act, see County of Washington
v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161 (1981).
     1804 See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984) (state prohi-

bition on gender discrimination in aspects of public accommodation, as applied to
membership in a civic organization, is justified by compelling state interest).
