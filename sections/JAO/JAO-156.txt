burdens, and the risk of an erroneous termination combine to re-
quire the provision of some minimum pre-termination notice and
opportunity to respond, followed by a full post-termination hearing,
complete with all the procedures normally accorded and back pay
if the employee is successful.830 Where the adverse action is less
than termination of employment, the governmental interest is sig-
nificant, and where reasonable grounds for such action have been
established separately, then a prompt hearing held after the ad-
verse action may be sufficient.831 In other cases, hearings with even
minimum procedures may be dispensed with when what is to be
established is so pro forma or routine that the likelihood of error is
very small.832 In a case dealing with negligent state failure to ob-
serve a procedural deadline, the Court held that the claimant was
entitled to a hearing with the agency to pass upon the merits of
his claim prior to dismissal of his action.833
    In Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc.,834 a Court plurality applied
a similar analysis to governmental regulation of private employ-
ment, determining that an employer may be ordered by an agency
to reinstate a “whistle-blower” employee without an opportunity for
a full evidentiary hearing, but that the employer is entitled to be
informed of the substance of the employee’s charges, and to have
an opportunity for informal rebuttal. The principal difference with
the Mathews v. Eldridge test was that here the Court acknowl-
edged two conflicting private interests to weigh in the equation: that
of the employer “in controlling the makeup of its workforce” and
that of the employee in not being discharged for whistleblowing.

     830 Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 170–71 (1974) (Justice Powell concurring),

and 416 U.S. at 195–96 (Justice White concurring in part and dissenting in part);
Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985) (discharge of state govern-
ment employee). In Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55 (1979), the Court held that the
state interest in assuring the integrity of horse racing carried on under its auspices
justified an interim suspension without a hearing once it established the existence
of certain facts, provided that a prompt judicial or administrative hearing would fol-
low suspension at which the issues could be determined was assured. See also FDIC
v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230 (1988) (strong public interest in the integrity of the banking
industry justifies suspension of indicted bank official with no pre-suspension hear-
ing, and with 90-day delay before decision resulting from post-suspension hearing).
     831 Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924 (1997) (no hearing required prior to suspen-

sion without pay of tenured police officer arrested and charged with a felony).
     832 E.g., Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105 (1977) (when suspension of driver’s license

is automatic upon conviction of a certain number of offenses, no hearing is required
because there can be no dispute about facts).
     833 Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982).
     834 481 U.S. 252 (1987). Justice Marshall’s plurality opinion was joined by Jus-

tices Blackmun, Powell, and O’Connor; Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia
joined Justice White’s opinion taking a somewhat narrower view of due process re-
quirements but supporting the plurality’s general approach. Justices Brennan and
Stevens would have required confrontation and cross-examination.
