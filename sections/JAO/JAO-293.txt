stood without keeping in view the history of the times when they
were adopted, and the general objects they plainly sought to accom-
plish. At the time when they were incorporated into the Constitu-
tion, it required little knowledge of human nature to anticipate that
those who had long been regarded as an inferior and subject race
would, when suddenly raised to the rank of citizenship, be looked
upon with jealousy and positive dislike, and that State laws might
be enacted or enforced to perpetuate the distinctions that had be-
fore existed. . . . [The Fourteenth Amendment] was designed to as-
sure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that
under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that
race the protection of the general government in that enjoyment,
whenever it should be denied by the States. It not only gave citizen-
ship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, but it de-
nied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal pro-
tection of the laws, and authorized Congress to enforce its provisions
by appropriate legislation.” 1586 Thus, a state law that on its face
discriminated against African-Americans was void.1587 In addition,
“[t]hough the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appear-
ance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with
an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust
and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circum-
stances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still
within the prohibition of the Constitution.” 1588

    Development and Application of “Separate But Equal”.—
Cases decided soon after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment
may be read as precluding any state-imposed distinction based on
race,1589 but the Court in Plessy v. Ferguson 1590 adopted a prin-
ciple first propounded in litigation attacking racial segregation in
    1586  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 306–07 (1880).
    1587  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880) (law limiting jury service to
white males). Moreover it will not do to argue that a law that segregates the races
or prohibits contacts between them discriminates equally against both races. Buchanan
v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917) (ordinance prohibiting blacks from occupying houses
in blocks where whites were predominant and whites from occupying houses in blocks
where blacks were predominant). Compare Pace v. Alabama, 106 U.S. 583 (1883)
(sustaining conviction under statute that imposed a greater penalty for adultery or
fornication between a white person and a Negro than was imposed for similar con-
duct by members of the same race, using “equal application” theory), with McLaughlin
v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 188 (1964), and Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 10 (1967)
(rejecting theory).
     1588 Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373–74 (1886) (discrimination against

Chinese).
