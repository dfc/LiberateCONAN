the state appellate court had ruled against the legal sufficiency of
these same allegations. Indubitably, Moore marked the abandon-
ment of the Supreme Court’s deference, founded upon consider-
ations of comity, to decisions of state appellate tribunals on issues
of constitutionality, and the proclamation of its intention no longer
to treat as virtually conclusive pronouncements by the latter that
proceedings in a trial court were fair, an abandonment soon made
even clearer in Brown v. Mississippi 1188 and now taken for granted.
     The Court has held, however, that the Due Process Clause does
not provide convicted persons a right to postconviction access to the
state’s evidence for DNA testing.1189 Chief Justice Roberts, in a five-
to-four decision, noted that 46 states had enacted statutes dealing
specifically with access to DNA evidence, and that the Federal Gov-
ernment had enacted a statute that allows federal prisoners to move
for court-ordered DNA testing under specified conditions. Even the
states that had not enacted statutes dealing specifically with ac-
cess to DNA evidence must, under the Due Process Clause, provide
adequate postconviction relief procedures. The Court, therefore, saw
“no reason to constitutionalize the issue.” 1190 It also expressed con-
cern that “[e]stablishing a freestanding right to access DNA evi-
dence for testing would force us to act as policymakers . . . . We
would soon have to decide if there is a constitutional obligation to
preserve forensic evidence that might later be tested. If so, for how
long? Would it be different for different types of evidence? Would
the State also have some obligation to gather such evidence in the
first place? How much, and when?” 1191
     Rights of Prisoners.—Until relatively recently the view pre-
vailed that a prisoner “has, as a consequence of his crime, not only
forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which
the law in its humanity accords to him. He is for the time being
the slave of the state.” 1192 This view is not now the law, and may
never have been wholly correct.1193 In 1948 the Court declared that
“[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limi-
tation of many privileges and rights”; 1194 “many,” indicated less than

are many reasons to provide it, not least of which is a fundamental concern in en-
suring that justice has been done in this case.” Id. at 17.
