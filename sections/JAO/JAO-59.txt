ply with New York regulations that required maintenance of an of-
fice in that state and the countersigning of policies by an agent resident
therein.261 Also, to discourage monopolies and to encourage rate com-
petition, a state constitutionally may impose on all fire insurance
companies connected with a tariff association fixing rates a liabil-
ity or penalty to be collected by the insured of 25% in excess of
actual loss or damage, stipulations in the insurance contract to the
contrary notwithstanding.262
    A state statute by which a life insurance company, if it fails to
pay upon demand the amount due under a policy after death of the
insured, is made liable in addition for fixed damages, reasonable in
amount, and for a reasonable attorney’s fee is not unconstitutional
even though payment is resisted in good faith and upon reasonable
grounds.263 It is also proper by law to cut off a defense by a life
insurance company based on false and fraudulent statements in the
application, unless the matter misrepresented actually contributed
to the death of the insured.264 A provision that suicide, unless con-
templated when the application for a policy was made, shall be no
defense is equally valid.265 When a cooperative life insurance asso-
ciation is reorganized so as to permit it to do a life insurance busi-
ness of every kind, policyholders are not deprived of their property
without due process of law.266 Similarly, when the method of liqui-
dation provided by a plan of rehabilitation of a mutual life insur-
ance company is as favorable to dissenting policyholders as would
have been the sale of assets and pro rata distribution to all credi-
tors, the dissenters are unable to show any taking without due pro-
cess. Dissenting policyholders have no constitutional right to a par-
ticular form of remedy.267
    Miscellaneous Businesses and Professions.—The practice of
