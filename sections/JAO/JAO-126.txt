    Although it quarreled with the Court’s finding in Bowers v.
Hardwick that the proscription against homosexual behavior had
“ancient roots,” Lawrence did not attempt to establish that such be-
havior was in fact historically condoned. This raises the question
as to what limiting principles are available in evaluating future ar-
guments based on personal autonomy. Although the Court seems to
recognize that a state may have an interest in regulating personal
relationships where there is a threat of “injury to a person or abuse
of an institution the law protects,” 663 it also seems to reject reli-
ance on historical notions of morality as guides to what personal
relationships are to be protected.664 Thus, the parameters for regu-
lation of sexual conduct remain unclear.
     For instance, the extent to which the government may regulate
the sexual activities of minors has not been established.665 Analy-
sis of this questions is hampered, however, because the Court has
still not explained what about the particular facets of human rela-
tionships—marriage, family, procreation—gives rise to a protected
liberty, and how indeed these factors vary significantly enough from
other human relationships. The Court’s observation in Roe v. Wade
“that only personal rights that can be deemed ‘fundamental’ are in-
cluded in this guarantee of personal privacy,” occasioning justifica-
tion by a “compelling” interest,666 provides little elucidation.667
    Despite the Court’s decision in Lawrence, there is a question as
to whether the development of noneconomic substantive due pro-
cess will proceed under an expansive right of “privacy” or under
the more limited “liberty” set out in Roe. There still appears to be
a tendency to designate a right or interest as a right of privacy when
    663  539 U.S. at 567.
    664  The Court noted with approval Justice Stevens’ dissenting opinion in Bow-
ers v. Hardwick, stating “that a governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed
a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law pro-
hibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting mis-
cegenation from constitutional attack.” 539 U.S. at 577–78, citing Bowers v. Hardwick,
478 U.S. at 216.
     665 The Court reserved this question in Carey, 431 U.S. at 694 n.17 (plurality

opinion), although Justices White, Powell, and Stevens in concurrence seemed to see
no barrier to state prohibition of sexual relations by minors. Id. at 702, 703, 712.
     666 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973). The language is quoted in full in Carey,

431 U.S. at 684–85.
     667 In the same Term the Court significantly restricted its equal protection doc-

trine of “fundamental” interests—“compelling” interest justification by holding that
the “key” to discovering whether an interest or a relationship is a “fundamental”
one is not its social significance but is whether it is “explicitly or implicitly guaran-
teed by the Constitution.” San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33–34
(1973). That this limitation has not been honored with respect to equal protection
analysis or due process analysis can be easily discerned. Compare Zablocki v. Redhail,
434 U.S. 374 (1978) (opinion of Court), with id. at 391 (Justice Stewart concurring),
and id. at 396 (Justice Powell concurring).
