     Such presence did not, however, expose a corporation to all man-
ner of suits. Under the reasoning of these early cases, even continu-
ous activity of some sort by a foreign corporation within a state would
not suffice to render it amenable to general jurisdiction therein for
suits unrelated to that activity. Without the protection of such a
rule, it was maintained, foreign corporations would be exposed to
the manifest hardship and inconvenience of defending, in any state
in which they happened to be carrying on business, suits for torts
wherever committed and claims on contracts wherever made.878 And
if the corporation stopped doing business in the forum state before
suit against it was commenced, it might well escape jurisdiction al-
together.879 The issue of the degree of activity required, in particu-
lar the degree of solicitation necessary to constitute doing business
by a foreign corporation, was much disputed and led to very particu-
laristic holdings.880 In the absence of enough activity to constitute
doing business, the mere presence within its territorial limits of an
agent, officer, or stockholder, upon whom service might readily be
had, was not effective to enable a state to acquire jurisdiction over
the foreign corporation.881
    The rationales and premises of these cases were swept away
by International Shoe Co. v. Washington and its “minimum con-
tacts” analysis,882 although the results in many of them would have
stood. International Shoe, an out-of-state corporation, had not been
issued a license to do business in Washington State, but it system-
atically and continuously employed a sales force of Washington resi-

Hall, 466 U.S. 408 (1984). Continuous operations were sometimes sufficiently sub-
stantial and of a nature to warrant assertions of jurisdiction. St. Louis S.W. Ry. v.
Alexander, 227 U.S. 218 (1913). See also Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.
Brown, 564 U.S. ___, No. 10–76, slip op. (2011) (distinguishing application of stream
of commerce analysis in specific cases of in-state injury from the degree of presence
a corporation must maintain in a state to be amenable to general jurisdiction there).

continue, however, if a state had conditioned doing business on a firm’s agreeing to
accept service through state officers should it and its agent withdraw. Washington
