    Property Taxes.—The state’s latitude of discretion is notably
wide in the classification of property for purposes of taxation and
the granting of partial or total exemption on the grounds of policy,1511
whether the exemption results from the terms of the statute itself
or the conduct of a state official implementing state policy.1512 A pro-
vision for the forfeiture of land for nonpayment of taxes is not in-
valid because the conditions to which it applies exist only in a part
of the state.1513 Also, differences in the basis of assessment are not
invalid where the person or property affected might properly be placed
in a separate class for purposes of taxation.1514
    Early cases drew the distinction between intentional and sys-
tematic discriminatory action by state officials in undervaluing some
property while taxing at full value other property in the same
class—an action that could be invalidated under the Equal Protec-
tion Clause—and mere errors in judgment resulting in unequal valu-
ation or undervaluation—actions that did not support a claim of dis-
crimination.1515 Subsequently, however, the Court in Allegheny
Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Webster County Comm’n,1516 found a denial
of equal protection to property owners whose assessments, based
on recent purchase prices, ranged from 8 to 35 times higher than
comparable neighboring property for which the assessor failed over
a 10-year period to readjust appraisals.
    Then, only a few years later, the Court upheld a California bal-
lot initiative that imposed a quite similar result: property that is
sold is appraised at purchase price, whereas assessments on prop-
erty that has stayed in the same hands since 1976 may rise no more
that 2% per year.1517 Allegheny Pittsburgh was distinguished, the
disparity in assessments being said to result from administrative
failure to implement state policy rather than from implementation
