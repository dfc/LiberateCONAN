sification imposes on representational rights.” 1946 But, though he
concurred in the holding, Justice Kennedy held out hope that judi-
cial relief from political gerrymandering may be possible “if some
limited and precise rationale were found” to evaluate partisan re-
districting. Davis v. Bandemer was thus preserved.1947
     In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, a widely
splintered Supreme Court plurality largely upheld a Texas congres-
sional redistricting plan that the state legislature had drawn mid-
decade, seemingly with the sole purpose of achieving a Republican
congressional majority.1948 The plurality did not revisit the justicia-
bility question, but examined “whether appellants’ claims offer the
Court a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for determining
whether a partisan gerrymander violates the Constitution.” 1949 The
plurality was “skeptical . . . of a claim that seeks to invalidate a
statute based on a legislature’s unlawful motive but does so with-
out reference to the content of the legislation enacted.” For one thing,
although “[t]he legislature does seem to have decided to redistrict
with the sole purpose of achieving a Republican congressional ma-
jority, . . . partisan aims did not guide every line it drew.” 1950 Apart
from that, the “sole-motivation theory” fails to show what is neces-
sary to identify an unconstitutional act of partisan gerrymander-
ing: “a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the complain-
ants’ representational rights.” 1951 Moreover, “[t]he sole-intent standard
. . . is no more compelling when it is linked to . . . mid-decennial
legislation. . . . [T]here is nothing inherently suspect about a legis-
lature’s decision to replace a mid-decade a court-ordered plan with
one of its own. And even if there were, the fact of mid-decade redis-
tricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political gerryman-
ders.” 1952 The plurality also found “that mid-decade redistricting for
exclusively partisan purposes” did not in this case “violate[ ] the
one-person, one-vote requirement.” 1953 Because ordinary mid-
decade districting plans do not necessarily violate the one-person,

    1947  541 U.S. at 306 (Justice Kennedy, concurring). Although Justice Kennedy
admitted that no workable model had been proposed either to evaluate the burden
partisan districting imposed on representational rights or to confine judicial inter-
vention once a violation has been established, he held out the possibility that such
a standard may emerge, based on either equal protection or First Amendment prin-
ciples.

to violate the Voting Rights Act because it diluted the voting power of Latinos. Id.
