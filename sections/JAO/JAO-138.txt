state law was not such so as to disqualify them.735 Sometimes, to
ensure an impartial tribunal, the Due Process Clause requires a
judge to recuse himself from a case. In Caperton v. A. T. Massey
Coal Co., Inc., the Court noted that “most matters relating to judi-
cial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level,” and that
“matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, [and] remoteness of
interest, would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative
discretion.” 736 The Court added, however, that “[t]he early and lead-
ing case on the subject” had “concluded that the Due Process Clause
incorporated the common-law rule that a judge must recuse him-
self when he has ‘a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary inter-
est’ in a case.” 737 In addition, although “[p]ersonal bias or preju-
dice ‘alone would not be sufficient basis for imposing a constitutional
requirement under the Due Process Clause,’ ” there “are circum-
stances ‘in which experience teaches that the probability of actual
bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be
constitutionally tolerable.’ ” 738 These circumstances include “where
a judge had a financial interest in the outcome of a case” or “a con-
flict arising from his participation in an earlier proceeding.” 739 In
such cases, “[t]he inquiry is an objective one. The Court asks not
whether the judge is actually, subjectively biased, but whether the
average judge in his position is ‘likely’ to be neutral, or whether
there is an unconstitutional ‘potential for bias.’ ” 740 In Caperton, a
company appealed a jury verdict of $50 million, and its chairman
spent $3 million to elect a justice to the Supreme Court of Appeals
of West Virginia at a time when “[i]t was reasonably foreseeable
. . . that the pending case would be before the newly elected jus-
tice.” 741 This $3 million was more than the total amount spent by
all other supporters of the justice and three times the amount spent
by the justice’s own committee. The justice was elected, declined to
recuse himself, and joined a 3-to-2 decision overturning the jury ver-
dict. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 opinion written by Justice Ken-
nedy, “conclude[d] that there is a serious risk of actual bias—based
on objective and reasonable perceptions—when a person with a per-
sonal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportion-
