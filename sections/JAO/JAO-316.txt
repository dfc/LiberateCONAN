series of implementing statutes enacted by Congress,1714 the admin-
istration of election statutes so as to treat white and black voters
or candidates differently can constitute a denial of equal protection
as well.1715 Additionally, cases of gerrymandering of electoral dis-
tricts and the creation or maintenance of electoral practices that
dilute and weaken black and other minority voting strength is sub-
ject to Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment and statutory at-
tack.1716

“Affirmative Action”: Remedial Use of Racial Classifications
    Of critical importance in equal protection litigation is the de-
gree to which government is permitted to take race or another sus-
pect classification into account when formulating and implement-
ing a remedy to overcome the effects of past discrimination. Often
the issue is framed in terms of “reverse discrimination,” in that the
governmental action deliberately favors members of one class and
consequently may adversely affect nonmembers of that class.1717 Al-
though the Court had previously accepted the use of suspect crite-
ria such as race to formulate remedies for specific instances of past
discrimination 1718 and had allowed preferences for members of cer-
tain non-suspect classes that had been the object of societal discrimi-
nation,1719 it was not until the late 1970s that the Court gave ple-
    1714  See “Federal Remedial Legislation,” infra.
    1715  E.g., Hadnott v. Amos, 394 U.S. 358 (1971); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S.
222 (1985) (disenfranchisement for crimes involving moral turpitude adopted for pur-
pose of racial discrimination).
     1716 E.g., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960); United Jewish Orgs. v. Carey,

430 U.S. 144 (1977); Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613 (1982).
     1717 While the emphasis is upon governmental action, private affirmative ac-

tions may implicate statutory bars to uses of race. E.g., McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail
Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273 (1976), held, not in the context of an affirmative action
program, that whites were as entitled as any group to protection of federal laws
banning racial discrimination in employment. The Court emphasized that it was not
passing at all on the permissibility of affirmative action programs. Id. at 280 n.8. In
United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), the Court held that title VII did
not prevent employers from instituting voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action
plans. Accord, Johnson v. Transportation Agency, 480 U.S. 616 (1987). Nor does title
VII prohibit a court from approving a consent decree providing broader relief than
the court would be permitted to award. Local 93, Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters v. City of
Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501 (1986). And, court-ordered relief pursuant to title VII may
benefit persons not themselves the victims of discrimination. Local 28 of the Sheet
Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421 (1986).
     1718 E.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 22–25

(1971).
     1719 Programs to overcome past societal discriminations against women have been

approved, Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974); Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498
(1975); Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977), but gender classifications are not
as suspect as racial ones. Preferential treatment for American Indians was ap-
proved, Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974), but on the basis that the classifica-
tion was political rather than racial.
