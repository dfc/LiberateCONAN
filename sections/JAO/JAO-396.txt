were general civil rights statutes that broadly attacked racial and
other discrimination on the part of private individuals and groups
as well as by the states, but the Supreme Court declared unconsti-
tutional or rendered ineffective practically all of these laws over the
course of several years.2074 In the end, Reconstruction was aban-
doned and with rare exceptions no cases were brought under the
remaining statutes until fairly recently.2075 Beginning with the Civil
Rights Act of 1957, however, Congress generally acted pursuant to
its powers under the Commerce Clause 2076 until Supreme Court de-
cisions indicated an expansive concept of congressional power un-
der the Civil War amendments,2077 which culminated in broad pro-
visions against private interference with civil rights in the 1968
legislation.2078 The story of these years is largely an account of the
“state action” doctrine in terms of its limitation on congressional
powers; 2079 lately, it is the still-unfolding history of the lessening
of the doctrine combined with a judicial vesting of discretion in Con-
gress to reinterpret the scope and content of the rights guaranteed
in these three constitutional amendments.

State Action
    In enforcing by appropriate legislation the Fourteenth Amend-
ment guarantees against state denials, Congress has the discretion
to adopt remedial measures, such as authorizing persons being de-
nied their civil rights in state courts to remove their cases to fed-

modern provisions surviving of these statutes are 18 U.S.C. §§ 241, 242, 42 U.S.C.
§§ 1981–83, 1985–1986, and 28 U.S.C. § 1343. Two lesser statutes were the Slave
Kidnaping Act of 1866, ch. 86, 14 Stat. 50, and the Peonage Abolition Act, ch. 187,
14 Stat. 546, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581–88, and 42 U.S.C. § 1994.
     2074 See generally R. CARR, FEDERAL PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS: QUEST FOR A SWORD

(1947).
     2075 For cases under 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242 in their previous codifications,

see United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383 (1915); United States v. Gradwell, 243
U.S. 476 (1917); United States v. Bathgate, 246 U.S. 220 (1918); United States v.
Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281 (1920). The resurgence of the use of these statutes began
with United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941), and Screws v. United States, 325
U.S. 91 (1945).
     2076 The 1957 and 1960 Acts primarily concerned voting; the public accommoda-

tions provisions of the 1964 Act and the housing provisions of the 1968 Act were
premised on the commerce power.
     2077 United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745 (1966); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384

U.S. 641 (1966). The development of congressional enforcement powers in these cases
was paralleled by a similar expansion of the enforcement powers of Congress with
regard to the Thirteenth Amendment, Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409
(1968). South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966).
     2078 82 Stat. 73, 18 U.S.C. § 245.
     2079 On the “state action” doctrine in the context of the direct application of § 1

of the Fourteenth Amendment, see discussion, supra.
