ers.1682 That situation was distinguished, however, in a due process
challenge to the federal system, where the foreman’s responsibili-
ties were “essentially clerical” and where the selection was from among
the members of an already chosen jury.1683

Capital Punishment
     In McCleskey v. Kemp 1684 the Court rejected an equal protec-
tion claim of a black defendant who received a death sentence fol-
lowing conviction for murder of a white victim, even though a sta-
tistical study showed that blacks charged with murdering whites
were more than four times as likely to receive a death sentence in
the state than were defendants charged with killing blacks. The Court
distinguished Batson v. Kentucky by characterizing capital sentenc-
ing as “fundamentally different” from jury venire selection; conse-
quently, reliance on statistical proof of discrimination is less rather
than more appropriate.1685 “Because discretion is essential to the
criminal justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof
before we would infer that the discretion has been abused.” 1686 Also,
the Court noted, there is not the same opportunity to rebut a sta-
tistical inference of discrimination; jurors may not be required to
testify as to their motives, and for the most part prosecutors are
similarly immune from inquiry.1687



    1682  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 551 n.4 (1979).
    1683  Hobby v. United States, 468 U.S. 339 (1984). Note also that in this limited
context where injury to the defendant was largely conjectural, the Court seemingly
revived the same class rule, holding that a white defendant challenging on due pro-
cess grounds exclusion of blacks as grand jury foremen could not rely on equal pro-
tection principles protecting black defendants from “the injuries of stigmatization
and prejudice” associated with discrimination. Id. at 347.
     1684 481 U.S. 279 (1987). The decision was 5–4, with Justice Powell’s opinion of

the Court being joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices White, O’Connor,
and Scalia, and with Justices Brennan, Blackmun, Stevens, and Marshall dissent-
ing.
     1685 481 U.S. at 294. Dissenting Justices Brennan, Blackmun and Stevens chal-

lenged this position as inconsistent with the Court’s usual approach to capital pun-
ishment, in which greater scrutiny is required. Id. at 340, 347–48, 366.
     1686 481 U.S. at 297. Discretion is especially important to the role of a capital

sentencing jury, which must be allowed to consider any mitigating factor relating to
the defendant’s background or character, or to the nature of the offense; the Court
also cited the “traditionally ‘wide discretion’ ” accorded decisions of prosecutors. Id.
at 296.
     1687 The Court distinguished Batson by suggesting that the death penalty chal-

lenge would require a prosecutor “to rebut a study that analyzes the past conduct of
scores of prosecutors” whereas the peremptory challenge inquiry would focus only
on the prosecutor’s own acts. 481 U.S. at 296 n.17.
