nies to operate in this manner.1535 A law that required private mo-
tor vehicle carriers to obtain certificates of convenience and neces-

     Sunday closing law: notwithstanding that they prohibit the sale of certain com-
modities and services while permitting the vending of others not markedly differ-
ent, and, even as to the latter, frequently restrict their distribution to small retail-
ers as distinguished from large establishments handling salable as well as nonsalable
items, such laws have been upheld. Despite the desirability of having a required
day of rest, a certain measure of mercantile activity must necessarily continue on
that day and in terms of requiring the smallest number of employees to forego their
day of rest and minimizing traffic congestion, it is preferable to limit this activity to
retailers employing the smallest number of workers; also, it curbs evasion to refuse
to permit stores dealing in both salable and nonsalable items to be open at all. McGowan
