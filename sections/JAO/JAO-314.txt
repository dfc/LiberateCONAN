Americans violated the Interstate Commerce Act,1697 and voided both
state-required and privately imposed segregation of the races on in-
terstate carriers as burdens on commerce.1698 Boynton v. Vir-
ginia 1699 voided a trespass conviction of an interstate African-
American bus passenger who had refused to leave a restaurant that
the Court viewed as an integral part of the facilities devoted to in-
terstate commerce and therefore subject to the Interstate Com-
merce Act.
    Public Facilities.—In the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, the Court, in a lengthy series of per curiam opinions, estab-
lished the invalidity of segregation in publicly provided or sup-
ported facilities and of required segregation in any facility or
function.1700 A municipality could not operate a racially segregated
park pursuant to a will that left the property for that purpose and
that specified that only whites could use the park,1701 but it was
permissible for the state courts to hold that the trust had failed
and to imply a reverter to the decedent’s heirs.1702 A municipality
under court order to desegregate its publicly owned swimming pools
was held to be entitled to close the pools instead, so long as it en-
tirely ceased operation of them.1703

    1697  Mitchell v. United States, 313 U.S. 80 (1941).
    1698  Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373 (1946); Henderson v. United States, 339
U.S. 816 (1950).
     1699 364 U.S. 454 (1960).
     1700 E.g., Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877 (1955)

(public beaches and bathhouses); Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (1955) (mu-
nicipal golf courses); Muir v. Louisville Park Theatrical Ass’n, 347 U.S. 971 (1954)
(city lease of park facilities); New Orleans City Park Improvement Ass’n v. Detiege,
358 U.S. 54 (1958) (public parks and golf courses); State Athletic Comm’n v. Dorsey,
359 U.S. 533 (1959) (statute requiring segregated athletic contests); Turner v. City
of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350 (1962) (administrative regulation requiring segregation
in airport restaurant); Schiro v. Bynum, 375 U.S. 395 (1964) (ordinance requiring
segregation in municipal auditorium).
     1701 Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966). State courts had removed the city as

trustee but the Court thought the city was still inextricably bound up in the opera-
tion and maintenance of the park. Justices Black, Harlan, and Stewart dissented
because they thought the removal of the city as trustee removed the element of state
action. Id. at 312, 315.
     1702 Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435 (1970). The Court thought that in effectuat-

ing the testator’s intent in the fashion best permitted by the Fourteenth Amend-
ment, the state courts engaged in no action violating the Equal Protection Clause.
Justices Douglas and Brennan dissented. Id. at 448, 450.
     1703 Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217 (1971). The Court found that there was

no official encouragement of discrimination through the act of closing the pools and
that inasmuch as both white and black citizens were deprived of the use of the pools
there was no unlawful discrimination. Justices White, Brennan, and Marshall dis-
sented, arguing that state action taken solely in opposition to desegregation was
impermissible, both in defiance of the lower court order and because it penalized
African-Americans for asserting their rights. Id. at 240. Justice Douglas also dis-
sented. Id. at 231.
