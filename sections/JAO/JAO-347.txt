v. Gordon,1848 which found an equal protection violation in a stat-
ute allowing illegitimate children to inherit by intestate succession
from their mothers but from their fathers only if the father had
“acknowledged” the child and the child had been legitimated by the
marriage of the parents. The father in Trimble had not acknowl-
edged his child, and had not married the mother, but a court had
determined that he was in fact the father and had ordered that he
pay child support. Carefully assessing the purposes asserted to be
the basis of the statutory scheme, the Court found all but one to be
impermissible or inapplicable and that one not served closely enough
by the restriction. First, it was impermissible to attempt to influ-
ence the conduct of adults not to engage in illicit sexual activities
by visiting the consequences upon the offspring.1849 Second, the as-
sertion that the statute mirrored the assumed intent of decedents,
in that, knowing of the statute’s operation, they would have acted
to counteract it through a will or otherwise, was rejected as un-
proved and unlikely.1850 Third, the argument that the law pre-
sented no insurmountable barrier to illegitimates inheriting since
a decedent could have left a will, married the mother, or taken steps
to legitimate the child, was rejected as inapposite.1851 Fourth, the
statute did address a substantial problem, a permissible state inter-
est, presented by the difficulties of proving paternity and avoiding
spurious claims. However, the court thought the means adopted, to-
tal exclusion, did not approach the “fit” necessary between means
and ends to survive the scrutiny appropriate to this classification.
The state court was criticized for failing “to consider the possibility
of a middle ground between the extremes of complete exclusion and
case-by-case determination of paternity. For at least some signifi-

     1848 430 U.S. 762 (1977). Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart, Blackmun,

and Rehnquist dissented, finding the statute “constitutionally indistinguishable” from
the one sustained in Labine. Id. at 776. Justice Rehnquist also dissented separately.
Id. at 777.
     1849 430 U.S. at 768–70. Although this purpose had been alluded to in Labine v.

Vincent, 401 U.S. 532, 538 (1971), it was rejected as a justification in Weber v. Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 173, 175 (1972). Visiting consequences upon
the parent appears to be permissible. Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 352–53 (1979).
     1850 Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 774–76 (1977). The Court cited the failure

of the state court to rely on this purpose and its own examination of the statute.
     1851 430 U.S. at 773–74. This justification had been prominent in Labine v. Vin-

cent, 401 U.S. 532, 539 (1971), and its absence had been deemed critical in Weber v.
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 170–71 (1972). The Trimble Court thought
this approach “somewhat of an analytical anomaly” and disapproved it. However,
the degree to which one could conform to the statute’s requirements and the reason-
ableness of those requirements in relation to a legitimate purpose are prominent in
Justice Powell’s reasoning in subsequent cases. Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259, 266–74
(1978); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 359 (1979) (concurring). See also Nyquist
v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1 (1977) (alienage); Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458
U.S. 718, 723 n.8 (1982) (sex); and compare id. at 736 (Justice Powell dissenting).
