that the classification based on sex had “a fair and substantial re-
lation to the object of the legislation.” 1817 However, the Court ob-
served that the state already conducted individualized hearings with
respect to the need of the wife, so that with little if any additional
burden needy males could be identified and helped. The use of the
sex standard as a proxy, therefore, was not justified because it need-
lessly burdened needy men and advantaged financially secure women
whose husbands were in need.1818
    Various forms of discrimination between unwed mothers and un-
wed fathers received different treatments based on the Court’s per-
ception of the justifications and presumptions underlying each. A
New York law permitted the unwed mother but not the unwed fa-
ther of an illegitimate child to block his adoption by withholding
consent. Acting in the instance of one who acknowledged his parent-
hood and who had maintained a close relationship with his child
over the years, the Court could discern no substantial relationship
between the classification and some important state interest. Pro-
motion of adoption of illegitimates and their consequent legitima-
tion was important, but the assumption that all unwed fathers ei-
ther stood in a different relationship to their children than did the
unwed mother or that the difficulty of finding the fathers would un-
reasonably burden the adoption process was overbroad, as the facts
of the case revealed. No barrier existed to the state dispensing with
consent when the father or his location is unknown, but disqualifi-
cation of all unwed fathers may not be used as a shorthand for that
step.1819
    On the other hand, the Court sustained a Georgia statute that
permitted the mother of an illegitimate child to sue for the wrong-
    1817  440 U.S. 268, 281 (1979).
    1818  440 U.S. at 281–83. An administrative convenience justification was not avail-
able, therefore. Id. at 281 & n.12. Although such an argument has been accepted as
a sufficient justification in at least some illegitimacy cases, Mathews v. Lucas, 427
U.S. 495, 509 (1976), it has neither wholly been ruled out nor accepted in sex cases.
In Lucas, 427 U.S. at 509–10, the Court interpreted Frontiero v. Richardson, 411
U.S. 677 (1973), as having required a showing at least that for every dollar lost to a
recipient not meeting the general purpose qualification a dollar is saved in adminis-
trative expense. In Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 152 (1980),
the Court said that “[i]t may be that there are levels of administrative convenience
that will justify discriminations that are subject to heightened scrutiny . . . , but
the requisite showing has not been made here by the mere claim that it would be
inconvenient to individualize determinations about widows as well as widowers.” Jus-
tice Stevens apparently would demand a factual showing of substantial savings. Califano
v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 219 (1977) (concurring).
     1819 Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380 (1979). Four Justices dissented. Id. at

394 (Justice Stewart), 401 (Justices Stevens and Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger).
For the conceptually different problem of classification between different groups of
women on the basis of marriage or absence of marriage to a wage earner, see Califano
v. Boles, 443 U.S. 282 (1979).
