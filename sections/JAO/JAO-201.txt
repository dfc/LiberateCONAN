    The fairness of a particular rule of procedure may also be the
basis for due process claims, but such decisions must be based on
the totality of the circumstances surrounding such procedures.1073
For instance, a court may not restrict the basic due process right
to testify in one’s own defense by automatically excluding all hyp-
notically refreshed testimony.1074 Or, though a state may require a
defendant to give pretrial notice of an intention to rely on an alibi
defense and to furnish the names of supporting witnesses, due pro-
cess requires reciprocal discovery in such circumstances, necessitat-
ing that the state give the defendant pretrial notice of its rebuttal
evidence on the alibi issue.1075 Due process is also violated when
the accused is compelled to stand trial before a jury while dressed


the lack of empirical data showing that the mere presence of the broadcast media
in the courtroom necessarily has an adverse effect on the process, the Court has
held that due process does not altogether preclude the televising of state criminal
trials. Chandler v. Florida, 449 U.S. 560 (1981). The decision was unanimous but
Justices Stewart and White concurred on the basis that Estes had established a per
se constitutional rule which had to be overruled, id. at 583, 586, contrary to the
Court’s position. Id. at 570–74.
     1073 For instance, the presumption of innocence has been central to a number of

Supreme Court cases. Under some circumstances it is a violation of due process and
reversible error to fail to instruct the jury that the defendant is entitled to a pre-
sumption of innocence, although the burden on the defendant is heavy to show that
an erroneous instruction or the failure to give a requested instruction tainted his
conviction. Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478 (1978). However, an instruction on the
presumption of innocence need not be given in every case. Kentucky v. Whorton,
441 U.S. 786 (1979) (reiterating that the totality of the circumstances must be looked
to in order to determine if failure to so instruct denied due process). The circum-
stances emphasized in Taylor included skeletal instructions on burden of proof com-
bined with the prosecutor’s remarks in his opening and closing statements inviting
the jury to consider the defendant’s prior record and his indictment in the present
case as indicating guilt. See also Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979) (in-
structing jury trying person charged with “purposely or knowingly” causing victim’s
death that “law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his
voluntary acts” denied due process because jury could have treated the presumption
as conclusive or as shifting burden of persuasion and in either event state would
not have carried its burden of proving guilt). See also Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S.
141 (1973); Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154–55 (1973). For other cases apply-
ing Sandstrom, see Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307 (1985) (contradictory but am-
biguous instruction not clearly explaining state’s burden of persuasion on intent does
not erase Sandstrom error in earlier part of charge); Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570
(1986) (Sandstrom error can in some circumstances constitute harmless error under
principles of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967)); Middleton v. McNeil, 541
U.S. 433 (2004) (state courts could assume that an erroneous jury instruction was
not reasonably likely to have misled a jury where other instructions made correct
standard clear). Similarly, improper arguments by a prosecutor do not necessarily
constitute “plain error,” and a reviewing court may consider in the context of the
entire record of the trial the trial court’s failure to redress such error in the absence
of contemporaneous objection. United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1 (1985).
     1074 Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44 (1987).
     1075 Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470 (1973).
