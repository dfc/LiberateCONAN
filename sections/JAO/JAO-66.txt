the Due Process Clause, to zone in many ways and for many pur-
poses. Governments may regulate the height of buildings,317 estab-
lish building setback requirements,318 preserve open spaces (through
density controls and restrictions on the numbers of houses),319 and
preserve historic structures.320 The Court will generally uphold a
challenged land-use plan unless it determines that either the over-
all plan is arbitrary and unreasonable with no substantial relation
to the public health, safety, or general welfare,321 or that the plan
as applied amounts to a taking of property without just compensa-
tion.322
     Applying these principles, the Court has held that the exclu-
sion of apartment houses, retail stores, and billboards from a “resi-
dential district” in a village is a permissible exercise of municipal
power.323 Similarly, a housing ordinance in a community of single-
family dwellings, in which any number of related persons (blood,
adoption, or marriage) could occupy a house but only two unre-
lated persons could do so, was sustained in the absence of any show-
ing that it was aimed at the deprivation of a “fundamental inter-
est.” 324 Such a fundamental interest, however, was found to be
implicated in Moore v. City of East Cleveland 325 by a “single fam-
ily” zoning ordinance which defined a “family” to exclude a grand-
mother who had been living with her two grandsons of different
children. Similarly, black persons cannot be forbidden to occupy houses
in blocks where the greater number of houses are occupied by white
persons, or vice versa.326
    In one aspect of zoning—the degree to which such decisions may
be delegated to private persons—the Court has not been consis-
tent. Thus, for instance, it invalidated a city ordinance which con-
ferred the power to establish building setback lines upon the own-
