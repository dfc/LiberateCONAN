in Lawrence v. Texas,561 the Supreme Court reversed itself, holding
that a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same
sex to engage in intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process
Clause.
    Similar disagreement over the appropriate level of generality
for definition of a liberty interest was evident in Michael H. v. Ger-
ald D., involving the rights of a biological father to establish pater-
nity and associate with a child born to the wife of another man.562
While recognizing the protection traditionally afforded a father, Jus-
tice Scalia, joined only by Chief Justice Rehnquist in this part of
the plurality decision, rejected the argument that a non-traditional
familial connection (i.e. the relationship between a father and the
offspring of an adulterous relationship) qualified for constitutional
protection, arguing that courts should limit consideration to “the
most specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting, or deny-
ing protection to, the asserted right can be identified.” 563 Dissent-
ing Justice Brennan, joined by two others, rejected the emphasis
on tradition, and argued instead that the Court should “ask whether
the specific parent-child relationship under consideration is close
enough to the interests that we already have protected [as] an as-
pect of ‘liberty.’ ” 564
    Abortion.—In Roe v. Wade,565 the Court established a right of
personal privacy protected by the Due Process Clause that includes
the right of a woman to determine whether or not to bear a child.
In doing so, the Court dramatically increased judicial oversight of
legislation under the privacy line of cases, striking down aspects of
abortion-related laws in practically all the states, the District of Co-
lumbia, and the territories. To reach this result, the Court first un-
192–93. In a dissent, Justice Blackmun indicated that he would have evaluated the
statute as applied to both homosexual and heterosexual conduct, and thus would
have resolved the broader issue not addressed by the Court—whether there is a gen-
eral right to privacy and autonomy in matters of sexual intimacy. Id. at 199–203
(Justice Blackmun dissenting, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens).
     561 539 U.S. 558 (2003) (overruling Bowers).
     562 491 U.S. 110 (1989). Five Justices agreed that a liberty interest was impli-

cated, but the Court ruled that California’s procedures for establishing paternity did
not unconstitutionally impinge on that interest.
     563 491 U.S. at 128 n.6.
     564 491 U.S. at 142.
     565 410 U.S. 113, 164 (1973). A companion case was Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179

(1973). The opinion by Justice Blackman was concurred in by Justices Douglas, Bren-
nan, Stewart, Marshall, and Powell, and Chief Justice Burger. Justices White and
Rehnquist dissented, id. at 171, 221, arguing that the Court should follow the tradi-
tional due process test of determining whether a law has a rational relation to a
valid state objective and that so judged the statute was valid. Justice Rehnquist
was willing to consider an absolute ban on abortions even when the mother’s life is
in jeopardy to be a denial of due process, 410 U.S. at 173, while Justice White left
the issue open. 410 U.S. at 223.
