of a coherent state policy.1518 California’s acquisition-value system
favoring those who hold on to property over those who purchase
and sell property was viewed as furthering rational state interests
in promoting “local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and sta-
bility,” and in protecting reasonable reliance interests of existing home-
owners.1519
    Allegheny Pittsburgh was similarly distinguished in Armour v.
City of Indianapolis,1520 where the Court held that Indianapolis, which
had abandoned one method of assessing payments against affected
lots for sewer projects for another, could forgive outstanding assess-
ments payments without refunding assessments already paid. In
Armour, owners of affected lots had been given the option of pay-
ing in one lump sum, or of paying in 10, 20 or 30-year installment
plan. Despite arguments that the forgiveness of the assessment re-
sulted in a significant disparity in the assessment paid by similarly-
situated homeowners, the Court found that avoiding the adminis-
trative burden of continuing to collect the outstanding fees was a
rational basis for the City’s decision.1521
    An owner aggrieved by discrimination is entitled to have his
assessment reduced to the common level.1522 Equal protection is de-
nied if a state does not itself remove the discrimination; it cannot
impose upon the person against whom the discrimination is di-
rected the burden of seeking an upward revision of the assessment
of other members of the class.1523 A corporation whose valuations
were accepted by the assessing commission cannot complain that it
was taxed disproportionately, as compared with others, if the com-
mission did not act fraudulently.1524
    Special Assessment.—A special assessment is not discrimina-

guished from the general benefit to the community.1525 Railroad
property may not be burdened for local improvements upon a basis
so wholly different from that used for ascertaining the contribution
demanded of individual owners as necessarily to produce manifest
