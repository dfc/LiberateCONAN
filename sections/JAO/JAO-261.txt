knowledged that “[t]he most arrogant legal scholar would not claim
that all of these cases cited applied a uniform or consistent test un-
der equal protection principles,” but then went on to note the differ-
ences between Lindsley and Royster Guano and chose the former.
But, shortly, in Schweiker v. Wilson,1396 in an opinion written by a
different Justice,1397 the Court sustained another classification, us-
ing the Royster Guano standard to evaluate whether the classifica-
tion bore a substantial relationship to the goal actually chosen and
articulated by Congress. In between these decisions, the Court ap-
proved a state classification after satisfying itself that the legisla-
ture had pursued a permissible goal, but setting aside the decision
of the state court that the classification would not promote that goal;
the Court announced that it was irrelevant whether in fact the goal
would be promoted, the question instead being whether the legisla-
ture “could rationally have decided” that it would.1398
     In short, it is uncertain which formulation of the rational basis
standard the Court will adhere to.1399 In the main, the issues in
recent years have not involved the validity of classifications, but
rather the care with which the Court has reviewed the facts and
the legislation with its legislative history to uphold the challenged
classifications. The recent decisions voiding classifications have not
clearly set out which standard they have been using.1400 Clarity in
this area, then, must await presentation to the Court of a classifi-
cation that it would sustain under the Lindsley standard and invali-
date under Royster Guano.
     The New Standards: Active Review.—When government leg-
islates or acts either on the basis of a “suspect” classification or with
has never required a legislature to articulate its reasons for enactng a statute. Id.
at 179. For a continuation of the debate over actual purpose and conceivable justifi-
cation, see Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp., 450 U.S. 662, 680–85 (1981)
(Justice Brennan concurring), and id. at 702–06 (Justice Rehnquist dissenting). Cf.
Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 243–45 (1981) (Justice Powell dissenting).
     1396 450 U.S. 221, 230–39 (1981). Nonetheless, the four dissenters thought that

the purpose discerned by the Court was not the actual purpose, that it had in fact
no purpose in mind, and that the classification was not rational. Id. at 239.
     1397 Justice Blackmun wrote the Court’s opinion in Wilson, Justice Rehnquist in

Fritz.
     1398 Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 461–70 (1981). The

quoted phrase is at 466.
     1399 In City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283 (1982), the Court

observed that it was not clear whether it would apply Royster Guano to the classifi-
cation at issue, citing Fritz as well as Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), an inter-
mediate standard case involving gender. Justice Powell denied that Royster Guano
or Reed v. Reed had ever been rejected. Id. at 301 n.6 (dissenting). See also id. at
296–97 (Justice White).
     1400 The exception is Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), which, though it pur-

ported to apply Royster Guano, may have applied heightened scrutiny. See Zobel v.
Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 61–63 (1982), in which the Court found the classifications
not rationally related to the goals, without discussing which standard it was using.
