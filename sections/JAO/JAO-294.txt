the schools of Boston, Massachusetts.1591 Plessy concerned not schools
but a state law requiring “equal but separate” facilities for rail trans-
portation and requiring the separation of “white and colored” pas-
sengers. “The object of the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment was undoubt-
edly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law,
but in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abol-
ish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distin-
guished from political, equality, or a commingling of the two races
upon terms unsatisfactory to either. Laws permitting, and even re-
quiring their separation in places where they are liable to be brought
into contact do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race
to the other, and have been generally, if not universally, recognized
as within the competency of the state legislatures in exercise of their
police power.” 1592 The Court observed that a common instance of
this type of law was the separation by race of children in school,
which had been upheld, it was noted, “even by courts of states where
the political rights of the colored race have been longest and most
earnestly enforced.” 1593
    Subsequent cases following Plessy that actually concerned school
segregation did not expressly question the doctrine and the Court’s
decisions assumed its validity. It held, for example, that a Chinese
student was not denied equal protection by being classified with
African-Americans and sent to school with them rather than with
whites,1594 and it upheld the refusal of an injunction to require a
school board to close a white high school until it opened a high school
for African-Americans.1595 And no violation of the Equal Protection
Clause was found when a state law prohibited a private college from
teaching whites and African-Americans together.1596
    In 1938, the Court began to move away from “separate but equal.”
It held that a state that operated a law school open to whites only

     1592 Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 543–44 (1896). “We consider the underly-

ing fallacy of the plaintiff ’s argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced
separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If
this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the
colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.” Id. at 552, 559.

in the District of Columbia was specifically noted. Justice Harlan’s well-known dis-
sent contended that the purpose and effect of the law in question was discrimina-
tory and stamped African-Americans with a badge of inferiority. “[I]n view of the
Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant,
ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and
neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.” Id. at 552, 559.
