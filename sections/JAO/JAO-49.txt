    Although the power of the state in this respect is not unlim-
ited, and an “arbitrary” and “unreasonable” imposition on these busi-
nesses may be set aside, the Court’s modern approach to substan-
tive due process analysis makes this possibility far less likely than
it once was. For instance, a 1935 case invalidated a requirement
that railroads share 50% of the cost of grade separation, irrespec-
tive of the value of such improvements to the railroad, suggesting
that railroads could not be required to subsidize competitive trans-
portation modes.202 But in 1953 the Court distinguished this case,
ruling that the costs of grade separation improvements need not be
allocated solely on the basis of benefits that would accrue to rail-
road property.203 Although the Court cautioned that “allocation of
costs must be fair and reasonable,” it was deferential to local gov-
ernmental decisions, stating that, in the exercise of the police power
to meet transportation, safety, and convenience needs of a growing
community, “the cost of such improvements may be allocated all to
the railroads.” 204
    Compellable Services.—A state may require that common car-
riers such as railroads provide services in a manner suitable for
the convenience of the communities they serve.205 Similarly, a pri-
mary duty of a public utility is to serve all those who desire the
service it renders, and so it follows that a company cannot pick and
choose to serve only those portions of its territory that it finds most
profitable. Therefore, compelling a gas company to continue serv-
ing specified cities as long as it continues to do business in other
parts of the state does not constitute an unconstitutional depriva-
