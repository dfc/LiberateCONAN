important in a particular case.1152 Second, the court must find that
the treatment is likely to render the defendant competent to stand
trial without resulting in side effects that will interfere with the
defendant’s ability to assist counsel. Third, the court must find that
less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the
same results. Finally, the court must conclude that administration
of the drugs is in the patient’s best medical interests.
    Guilty Pleas.—A defendant may plead guilty instead of insist-
ing that the prosecution prove him guilty. Often the defendant does
so as part of a “plea bargain” with the prosecution, where the de-
fendant is guaranteed a light sentence or is allowed to plead to a
lesser offense.1153 Although the government may not structure its
system so as to coerce a guilty plea,1154 a guilty plea that is en-
tered voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly, even to obtain
an advantage, is sufficient to overcome constitutional objections.1155
The guilty plea and the often concomitant plea bargain are impor-
tant and necessary components of the criminal justice system,1156
and it is permissible for a prosecutor during such plea bargains to
require a defendant to forgo his right to a trial in return for escap-
ing additional charges that are likely upon conviction to result in a
more severe penalty.1157 But the prosecutor does deny due process

     1152 For instance, if the defendant is likely to remain civilly committed absent

medication, this would diminish the government’s interest in prosecution. 539 U.S.

     1153 There are a number of other reasons why a defendant may be willing to

plead guilty. There may be overwhelming evidence against him or his sentence after
trial will be more severe than if he pleads guilty.
     1154 United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968).
     1155 North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1971); Parker v. North Carolina, 397

U.S. 790 (1970). See also Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970). A guilty plea
will ordinarily waive challenges to alleged unconstitutional police practices occur-
ring prior to the plea, unless the defendant can show that the plea resulted from
incompetent counsel. Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258 (1973); Davis v. United States,
411 U.S. 233 (1973). But see Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974). The state can
permit pleas of guilty in which the defendant reserves the right to raise constitu-
tional questions on appeal, and federal habeas courts will honor that arrangement.
Lefkowitz v. Newsome, 420 U.S. 283 (1975). Release-dismissal agreements, pursu-
ant to which the prosecution agrees to dismiss criminal charges in exchange for the
defendant’s agreement to release his right to file a civil action for alleged police or
prosecutorial misconduct, are not per se invalid. Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480
U.S. 386 (1987).
     1156 Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 71 (1977).
     1157 Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357 (1978). Charged with forgery, Hayes

was informed during plea negotiations that if he would plead guilty the prosecutor
would recommend a five-year sentence; if he did not plead guilty, the prosecutor would
also seek an indictment under the habitual criminal statute under which Hayes,
because of two prior felony convictions, would receive a mandatory life sentence if
convicted. Hayes refused to plead, was reindicted, and upon conviction was sen-
tenced to life. Four Justices dissented, id. at 365, 368, contending that the Court
had watered down North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969). See also United
