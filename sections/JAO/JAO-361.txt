requirement that independent candidates for President and Vice-

    Apportionment and Districting.—Prior to 1962, attacks in fed-
eral courts on the drawing of boundaries for congressional 1906 and
legislative election districts or the apportionment of seats to previ-
ously existing units ran afoul of the “political question” doc-
trine.1907 Baker v. Carr,1908 however, reinterpreted the doctrine to a
considerable degree and opened the federal courts to voter com-
plaints founded on unequally populated voting districts. Wesberry
v. Sanders 1909 found that Article I, § 2, of the Constitution re-
quired that, in the election of Members of the House of Representa-
tives, districts were to be made up of substantially equal numbers
of persons. In six decisions handed down on June 15, 1964, the Court
required the alteration of the election districts for practically all the
legislative bodies in the United States.1910

conventions simultaneously with the primary elections the cost of which they had to
bear. For consideration of similar contentions in the context of federal financing of
presidential elections, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93–97 (1976).
     1905 Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983). State interests in assuring voter

education, treating all candidates equally (candidates participating in a party pri-
mary also had to declare candidacy in March), and preserving political stability, were
deemed insufficient to justify the substantial impediment to independent candidates
and their supporters.
     1906 This subject is also discussed under Article I, Section 2, Congressional District-

ing.
     1907 See discussion, supra. Applicability of the doctrine to cases of this nature

was left unresolved in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355 (1932), and Wood v. Broom, 287
U.S. 1 (1932), was supported by only a plurality in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549
(1946), but became the position of the Court in subsequent cases. Cook v. Fortson,
329 U.S. 675 (1946); Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804 (1947); MacDougall v. Green,
335 U.S. 281 (1948); South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276 (1950); Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357
U.S. 916 (1958).
     1908 369 U.S. 186 (1962).
     1909 376 U.S. 1 (1964). Striking down a county unit system of electing a gover-

nor, the Court, in an opinion by Justice Douglas, had already coined a variant phrase
of the more popular “one man, one vote.” “The conception of political equality from
the Declaration of Independence to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth,
Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing—one person,
one vote.” Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 381 (1963).
     1910 Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964); WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S.

633 (1964); Maryland Comm. for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656 (1964);
Donis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678 (1964); Roman v. Sincock, 377 U.S. 695 (1964); Lucas
v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713 (1964). In the last case,
the Court held that approval of the apportionment plan in a vote of the people was
insufficient to preserve it from constitutional attack. “An individual’s constitution-
ally protected right to cast an equally weighed vote cannot be denied even by a vote
of a majority of a State’s electorate, if the apportionment scheme adopted by the
voters fails to measure up to the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.” Id.
at 736. In Reynolds v. Sims, Justice Harlan dissented wholly, denying that the Equal
Protection Clause had any application at all to apportionment and districting and
contending that the decisions were actually the result of a “reformist” nonjudicial
