at all; consequently, there was nothing to hold a hearing about.1222
The same principles govern interstate prison transfers.1223
     Transfer of a prisoner to a high security facility, with an atten-
dant loss of the right to parole, gave rise to a liberty interest, al-
though the due process requirements to protect this interest are lim-
ited.1224 On the other hand, transfer of a prisoner to a mental hospital
pursuant to a statute authorizing transfer if the inmate suffers from
a “mental disease or defect” must, for two reasons, be preceded by
a hearing. First, the statute gave the inmate a liberty interest, be-
cause it presumed that he would not be moved absent a finding that
he was suffering from a mental disease or defect. Second, unlike
transfers from one prison to another, transfer to a mental institu-
tion was not within the range of confinement covered by the prison-
er’s sentence, and, moreover, imposed a stigma constituting a depri-
vation of a liberty interest.1225
     The kind of hearing that is required before a state may force a
mentally ill prisoner to take antipsychotic drugs against his will
was at issue in Washington v. Harper.1226 There the Court held that
a judicial hearing was not required. Instead, the inmate’s substan-
tive liberty interest (derived from the Due Process Clause as well
as from state law) was adequately protected by an administrative
hearing before independent medical professionals, at which hear-
ing the inmate has the right to a lay advisor but not an attorney.
     Probation and Parole.—Sometimes convicted defendants are
not sentenced to jail, but instead are placed on probation subject to
incarceration upon violation of the conditions that are imposed; oth-
ers who are jailed may subsequently qualify for release on parole
before completing their sentence, and are subject to reincarceration
upon violation of imposed conditions. Because both of these disposi-
tions are statutory privileges granted by the governmental author-
ity,1227 it was long assumed that the administrators of the systems
did not have to accord procedural due process either in the grant-

prison, with attendant loss of parole eligibility and with only annual status review,
constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship”). In Wilkinson, the Court upheld
Ohio’s multi-level review process, despite the fact that a prisoner was provided only
summary notice as to the allegations against him, a limited record was created, the
prisoner could not call witnesses, and reevaluation of the assignment only occurred
at one 30-day review and then annually. Id. at 219–20.

     1227 Ughbanks v. Armstrong, 208 U.S. 481 (1908), held that parole is not a con-

stitutional right but instead is a “present” from government to the prisoner. In Escoe
v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490 (1935), the Court’s premise was that as a matter of grace
