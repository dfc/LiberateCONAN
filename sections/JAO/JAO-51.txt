     Generally, regulation of a utility’s service to commercial custom-
ers attracts less scrutiny 211 than do regulations intended to facili-
tate the operations of a competitor,212 and governmental power to
regulate in the interest of safety has long been conceded.213 Require-
ments for service having no substantial relation to a utility’s regu-
lated function, however, have been voided, such as requiring rail-
roads to maintain scales to facilitate trading in cattle, or prohibiting
letting down an unoccupied upper berth on a rail car while the lower
berth was occupied.214
     Imposition of Statutory Liabilities and Penalties Upon Com-
mon Carriers.—Legislators have considerable latitude to impose
legal burdens upon common carriers, as long as the carriers are not
     211 Due process is not denied when two carriers, who wholly own and dominate

a small connecting railroad, are prohibited from exacting higher charges from ship-
pers accepting delivery over said connecting road than are collected from shippers
taking delivery at the terminals of said carriers. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. v. Minne-
apolis Civic Ass’n, 247 U.S. 490 (1918). Nor are railroads denied due process when
they are forbidden to exact a greater charge for a shorter distance than for a longer
distance. Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Kentucky, 183 U.S. 503, 512 (1902); Mis-
souri Pacific Ry. v. McGrew Coal Co., 244 U.S. 191 (1917). Nor is it “unreasonable”
or “arbitrary” to require a railroad to desist from demanding advance payment on
merchandise received from one carrier while it accepts merchandise of the same char-
acter at the same point from another carrier without such prepayment. Wadley South-
ern Ry. v. Georgia, 235 U.S. 651 (1915).
     212 Although a carrier is under a duty to accept goods tendered at its station, it

cannot be required, upon payment simply for the service of carriage, to accept cars
offered at an arbitrary connection point near its terminus by a competing road seek-
ing to reach and use the former’s terminal facilities. Nor may a carrier be required
to deliver its cars to connecting carriers without adequate protection from loss or
undue detention or compensation for their use. Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Stock
Yards Co., 212 U.S. 132 (1909). But a carrier may be compelled to interchange its
freight cars with other carriers under reasonable terms, Michigan Cent. R.R. v. Michi-
gan R.R. Comm’n, 236 U.S. 615 (1915), and to accept cars already loaded and in
suitable condition for reshipment over its lines to points within the state. Chicago,
M. & St. P. Ry. v. Iowa, 233 U.S. 334 (1914).
     213 The following cases all concern the operation of railroads: Railroad Co. v.

Richmond, 96 U.S. 521 (1878) (prohibition against operation on certain streets); At-

the presence of a flagman at a crossing notwithstanding that automatic devices might
be cheaper and better); Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Alabama, 128 U.S. 96 (1888)
