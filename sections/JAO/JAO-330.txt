and thus deprecate the historic values of citizenship.’ ” 1779 Uphold-
ing a state restriction against aliens qualifying as state policemen,
the Court reasoned that the permissible distinction between citizen
and alien is that the former “is entitled to participate in the pro-
cesses of democratic decisionmaking. Accordingly, we have recog-
nized ‘a State’s historic power to exclude aliens from participation
in its democratic political institutions,’ . . . as part of the sover-
eign’s obligation ‘to preserve the basic conception of a political com-
munity.’ ” 1780 Discrimination by a state against aliens is not sub-
ject to strict scrutiny, but need meet only the rational basis test. It
is therefore permissible to reserve to citizens offices having the “most
important policy responsibilities,” a principle drawn from Sugar-
man, but the critical factor in this case is its analysis finding that
“the police function is . . . one of the basic functions of government
. . . . The execution of the broad powers vested in [police officers]
affects members of the public significantly and often in the most
sensitive areas of daily life. . . . Clearly the exercise of police au-
thority calls for a very high degree of judgment and discretion, the
abuse or misuse of which can have serious impact on individuals.
The office of a policeman is in no sense one of ‘the common occupa-
tions of the community.’ . . . ” 1781
     Continuing to enlarge the exception, the Court in Ambach v.
Norwick 1782 upheld a bar to qualifying as a public school teacher
for resident aliens who have not manifested an intention to apply
for citizenship. The “governmental function” test took on added sig-
nificance, the Court saying that the “distinction between citizens
and aliens, though ordinarily irrelevant to private activity, is funda-
     1779 Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 295 (1978). The opinion was by Chief Jus-

tice Burger and the quoted phrase was from his dissent in Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432
U.S. 1, 14 (1977). Justices Marshall, Stevens, and Brennan dissented. Id. at 302,
307.
     1780 435 U.S. at 295–96. Formally following Sugarman v. Dougall, supra, the opin-

ion considerably enlarged the exception noted in that case; see also Nyquist v. Mauclet,
432 U.S. 1, 11 (1977) (emphasizing the “narrowness of the exception”). Concurring
in Foley, 435 U.S. at 300, Justice Stewart observed that “it is difficult if not impos-
sible to reconcile the Court’s judgment in this case with the full sweep of the reason-
ing and authority of some of our past decisions. It is only because I have become
increasingly doubtful about the validity of those decisions (in at least some of which
I concurred) that I join the opinion of the Court in this case.” On the other hand,
Justice Blackmun, who had written several of the past decisions, including Mauclet,
concurred also, finding the case consistent. Id.
     1781 35 U.S. at 296, 297, 298. In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), barring

patronage dismissals of police officers, the Court had nonetheless recognized an ex-
ception for policymaking officers which it did not extend to the police.
     1782 411 U.S. 68 (1979). The opinion, by Justice Powell, was joined by Chief Jus-

tice Burger and Justices Stewart, White, and Rehnquist. Dissenting were Justices
Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens. The disqualification standard was of
course, that held invalid as a disqualification for receipt of educational assistance in
Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1 (1977).
