     Substantive Review of Price Controls.—Ironically, private busi-
nesses, once they had been found subject to price regulation, seemed
to have less protection than public entities. Thus, unlike operators
of public utilities who, in return for a government grant of virtu-
ally monopolistic privileges must provide continuous service, propri-
etors of other businesses receive no similar special advantages and
accordingly are unrestricted in their right to liquidate and close.
Owners of ordinary businesses, therefore, are at liberty to escape
the consequences of publicly imposed charges by dissolution, and
have been found less in need of protection through judicial review.
Thus, case law upholding challenges to price controls deals predomi-
nantly with governmentally imposed rates and charges for public
utilities.
     In 1886, Chief Justice Waite, in the Railroad Commission Cases,157
warned that the “power to regulate is not a power to destroy, and
. . . the State cannot . . . do that which in law amounts to a tak-
ing of property for public use without just compensation, or with-
out due process of law.” In other words, a confiscatory rate could
not be imposed by government on a regulated entity. By treating
“due process of law” and “just compensation” as equivalents,158 the
Court was in effect asserting that the imposition of a rate so low
as to damage or diminish private property ceased to be an exercise
of a state’s police power and became one of eminent domain. Never-
theless, even this doctrine proved inadequate to satisfy public utili-
ties, as it allowed courts to intervene only to prevent imposition of
a confiscatory rate, i.e., a rate so low as to be productive of a loss
and to amount to taking of property without just compensation. The
utilities sought nothing less than a judicial acknowledgment that
courts could review the “reasonableness” of legislative rates.
    Although as late as 1888 the Court doubted that it possessed
the requisite power to challenge this doctrine,159 it finally acceded
to the wishes of the utilities in 1890 in Chicago, M. & St. P. Rail-
way v. Minnesota.160 In this case, the Court ruled that “[t]he ques-
tion of the reasonableness of a rate . . . , involving as it does the
element of reasonableness both as regards the company and as re-
gards the public, is eminently a question for judicial investigation,
requiring due process of law for its determination. If the company
was disapproved in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726 (1963), and Tyson & Bro. v.
Banton, 273 U.S. 418 (1927), was effectively overruled in Gold v. DiCarlo, 380 U.S.
520 (1965), without the Court’s hearing argument on it.
    157 116 U.S. 307, 331 (1886).
    158 This was contrary to its earlier holding in Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U.S.

97 (1877).
    159 Dow v. Beidelman, 125 U.S. 680 (1888).
    160 134 U.S. 418, 458 (1890).
