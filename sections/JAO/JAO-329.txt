     State bars against the admission of aliens to the practice of law
were also struck down, the Court holding that the state had not
met the “heavy burden” of showing that its denial of admission to
aliens was necessary to accomplish a constitutionally permissible
and substantial interest. The state’s admitted interest in assuring
the requisite qualifications of persons licensed to practice law could
be adequately served by judging applicants on a case-by-case basis
and in no sense could the fact that a lawyer is considered to be an
officer of the court serve as a valid justification for a flat prohibi-
tion.1775 Nor could Puerto Rico offer a justification for excluding aliens
from one of the “common occupations of the community,” hence its
bar on licensing aliens as civil engineers was voided.1776
    In Nyquist v. Mauclet,1777 the Court seemed to expand the doc-
trine. The statute that was challenged restricted the receipt of schol-
arships and similar financial support to citizens or to aliens who
were applying for citizenship or who filed a statement affirming their
intent to apply as soon as they became eligible. Therefore, because
any alien could escape the limitation by a voluntary act, the dis-
qualification was not aimed at aliens as a class, nor was it based
on an immutable characteristic possessed by a “discrete and insu-
lar minority”—the classification that had been the basis for declar-
ing alienage a suspect category in the first place. But the Court
voided the statute. “The important points are that § 661(3) is di-
rected at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact that
the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it does not
discriminate against the class.” 1778 Two proffered justifications were
held insufficient to meet the high burden imposed by the strict scru-
tiny doctrine.
    In the following Term, however, the Court denied that every ex-
clusion of aliens was subject to strict scrutiny, “because to do so
would ‘obliterate all the distinctions between citizens and aliens,

zens and aliens generally, but it did not declare the doctrine invalid. Id. at 643–45.
The “political function” exception is inapplicable to notaries public, who do not per-
form functions going to the heart of representative government. Bernal v. Fainter,
467 U.S. 216 (1984).
     1775 In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717 (1973). Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist

dissented. Id. at 730, and 649 (Sugarman dissent also applicable to Griffiths).
     1776 Examining Bd. v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572 (1976). Because the jurisdic-

tion was Puerto Rico, the Court was not sure whether the requirement should be
governed by the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment but deemed the question immate-
rial, as the same result would be achieved in either case. The quoted expression is
from Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41 (1915).
     1777 432 U.S. 1 (1977).
     1778 432 U.S. at 9. Chief Justice Burger and Justices Powell, Rehnquist, and

Stewart dissented. Id. at 12, 15, 17. Justice Rehnquist’s dissent argued that the na-
ture of the disqualification precluded it from being considered suspect.
