Process Clause.674 And the concept of “family” may extend beyond
the biological relationship to the situation of foster families, al-
though the Court has acknowledged that such a claim raises com-
plex and novel questions, and that the liberty interests may be lim-
ited.675 On the other hand, the Court has held that the presumption
of legitimacy accorded to a child born to a married woman living
with her husband is valid even to defeat the right of the child’s bio-
logical father to establish paternity and visitation rights.676
    The Court has merely touched upon but not dealt definitively
with the complex and novel questions raised by possible conflicts
between parental rights and children’s rights.677 The Court has, how-
ever, imposed limits on the ability of a court to require that chil-
dren be made available for visitation with grandparents and other
third parties. In Troxel v. Granville,678 the Court evaluated a Wash-
ington State law that allowed “any person” to petition a court “at
any time” to obtain visitation rights whenever visitation “may serve
the best interests” of a child. Under this law, a child’s grandpar-
ents were awarded more visitation with a child than was desired
by the sole surviving parent. A plurality of the Court, noting the
“fundamental rights of parents to make decisions concerning the care,
custody and control of their children,” 679 reversed this decision, not-

     674 Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977) (plurality opinion). The

fifth vote, decisive to the invalidity of the ordinance, was on other grounds. Id. at
513.
     675 Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816 (1977). As the Court

noted, the rights of a natural family arise independently of statutory law, whereas
the ties that develop between a foster parent and a foster child arise as a result of
state-ordered arrangement. As these latter liberty interests arise from positive law,
they are subject to the limited expectations and entitlements provided under those
laws. Further, in some cases, such liberty interests may not be recognized without
derogation of the substantive liberty interests of the natural parents. Although Smith
does not define the nature of the interest of foster parents, it would appear to be
quite limited and attenuated. Id. at 842–47. In a conflict between natural and foster
families, a court is likely to defer to a typical state process which makes such deci-
sions based on the best interests of the child. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246
(1978).
     676 Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110 (1989). There was no opinion of the

Court. A majority of Justices (Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens, White) was
willing to recognize that the biological father has a liberty interest in a relationship
with his child, but Justice Stevens voted with the plurality (Scalia, Rehnquist, O’Connor,
Kennedy) because he believed that the statute at issue adequately protected that
interest.
     677 The clearest conflict to date was presented by state law giving a veto to par-

ents over their minor children’s right to have an abortion. Planned Parenthood v.
Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976); Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 503 U.S. 833 (1992).
