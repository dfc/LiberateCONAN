extensively in the section on criminal due process. However, they
are worth noting here. In Meachum v. Fano,802 the Court held that
a state prisoner was not entitled to a fact-finding hearing when he
was transferred to a different prison in which the conditions were
substantially less favorable to him, because (1) the Due Process Clause
liberty interest by itself was satisfied by the initial valid convic-
tion, which had deprived him of liberty, and (2) no state law guar-
anteed him the right to remain in the prison to which he was ini-
tially assigned, subject to transfer for cause of some sort. As a prisoner
could be transferred for any reason or for no reason under state
law, the decision of prison officials was not dependent upon any state
of facts, and no hearing was required.
     In Vitek v. Jones,803 by contrast, a state statute permitted trans-
fer of a prisoner to a state mental hospital for treatment, but the
transfer could be effectuated only upon a finding, by a designated
physician or psychologist, that the prisoner “suffers from a mental
disease or defect” and “cannot be given treatment in that facility.”
Because the transfer was conditioned upon a “cause,” the establish-
ment of the facts necessary to show the cause had to be done through
fair procedures. Interestingly, however, the Vitek Court also held that
the prisoner had a “residuum of liberty” in being free from the dif-
ferent confinement and from the stigma of involuntary commit-
ment for mental disease that the Due Process Clause protected. Thus,
the Court has recognized, in this case and in the cases involving
revocation of parole or probation,804 a liberty interest that is sepa-
rate from a statutory entitlement and that can be taken away only
through proper procedures.
     But, with respect to the possibility of parole or commutation or
otherwise more rapid release, no matter how much the expectancy
matters to a prisoner, in the absence of some form of positive en-
titlement, the prisoner may be turned down without observance of
procedures.805 Summarizing its prior holdings, the Court recently
concluded that two requirements must be present before a liberty
interest is created in the prison context: the statute or regulation
must contain “substantive predicates” limiting the exercise of dis-
cretion, and there must be explicit “mandatory language” requiring
