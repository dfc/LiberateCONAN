ever, the Court began a rapid expansion of the “liberty” and “prop-
erty” aspects of the clause to include such non-traditional concepts
as conditional property rights and statutory entitlements. Since then,
the Court has followed an inconsistent path of expanding and con-
tracting the breadth of these protected interests. The “life” inter-
est, on the other hand, although often important in criminal cases,
has found little application in the civil context.
    The Property Interest.—The expansion of the concept of “prop-
erty rights” beyond its common law roots reflected a recognition by
the Court that certain interests that fall short of traditional prop-
erty rights are nonetheless important parts of people’s economic well-
being. For instance, where household goods were sold under an in-
stallment contract and title was retained by the seller, the possessory
interest of the buyer was deemed sufficiently important to require
procedural due process before repossession could occur.758 In addi-
tion, the loss of the use of garnished wages between the time of
garnishment and final resolution of the underlying suit was deemed
a sufficient property interest to require some form of determination
that the garnisher was likely to prevail.759 Furthermore, the contin-
ued possession of a driver’s license, which may be essential to one’s
livelihood, is protected; thus, a license should not be suspended af-
ter an accident for failure to post a security for the amount of dam-
ages claimed by an injured party without affording the driver an
opportunity to raise the issue of liability.760
    A more fundamental shift in the concept of property occurred
with recognition of society’s growing economic reliance on govern-
ment benefits, employment, and contracts,761 and with the decline
of the “right-privilege” principle. This principle, discussed previ-
ously in the First Amendment context,762 was pithily summarized
by Justice Holmes in dismissing a suit by a policeman protesting
being fired from his job: “The petitioner may have a constitutional
right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a po-
