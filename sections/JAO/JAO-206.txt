level of materiality by classifying the situation under which the ex-
culpating information was withheld. Second, it was not clear, if the
fairness of the trial was at issue, why the circumstances of the fail-
ure to disclose should affect the evaluation of the impact that such
information would have had on the trial. Ultimately, the Court ad-
dressed these issues in United States v. Bagley 1097.
     In Bagley, the Court established a uniform test for materiality,
choosing the most stringent requirement that evidence is material
if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-
closed to the defense, the outcome of the proceeding would have been
different.1098 This materiality standard, found in contexts outside
of Brady inquiries,1099 is applied not only to exculpatory material,
but also to material that would be relevant to the impeachment of
witnesses.1100 Thus, where inconsistent earlier statements by a wit-
ness to an abduction were not disclosed, the Court weighed the spe-
cific effect that impeachment of the witness would have had on es-
tablishing the required elements of the crime and of the punishment,
finally concluding that there was no reasonable probability that the
jury would have reached a different result.1101
     The Supreme Court has also held that “Brady suppression oc-
curs when the government fails to turn over even evidence that is
‘known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.’ . . .
‘[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable
evidence known to others acting on the government’s behalf in the
case, including the police.’ ” 1102

by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole
case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict. Kyles v.
