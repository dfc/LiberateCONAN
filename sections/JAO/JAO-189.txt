             PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS—CRIMINAL

Generally: The Principle of Fundamental Fairness
     The Court has held that practically all the criminal procedural
guarantees of the Bill of Rights—the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth
Amendments—are fundamental to state criminal justice systems and
that the absence of one or the other particular guarantees denies a
suspect or a defendant due process of law under the Fourteenth
Amendment.1019 In addition, the Court has held that the Due Pro-
cess Clause protects against practices and policies that violate pre-
cepts of fundamental fairness,1020 even if they do not violate spe-
cific guarantees of the Bill of Rights.1021 The standard query in such
cases is whether the challenged practice or policy violates “a funda-
     1018 405 U.S. at 74–79 (conditioning appeal in eviction action upon tenant post-

ing bond, with two sureties, in twice the amount of rent expected to accrue pending
appeal, is invalid when no similar provision is applied to other cases). Cf. Bankers
Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U.S. 71 (1988) (assessment of 15% penalty on
party who unsuccessfully appeals from money judgment meets rational basis test
under equal protection challenge, since it applies to plaintiffs and defendants alike
and does not single out one class of appellants).
     1019 See analysis under the Bill of Rights, “Fourteenth Amendment,” supra.
     1020 For instance, In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), held that, despite the ab-

sence of a specific constitutional provision requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt
in criminal cases, such proof is required by due process. For other recurrences to
general due process reasoning, as distinct from reliance on more specific Bill of Rights
provisions, see, e.g., Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973) (defendant may
not be denied opportunity to explore confession of third party to crime for which
defendant is charged); Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470 (1973) (defendant may not
be held to rule requiring disclosure to prosecution of an alibi defense unless defen-
dant is given reciprocal discovery rights against the state); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421
U.S. 684 (1975) (defendant may not be required to carry the burden of disproving
an element of a crime for which he is charged); Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501
(1976) (a state cannot compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed
in identifiable prison clothes); Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145 (1977) (sufficiency
of jury instructions); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977) (defendant may be
required to bear burden of affirmative defense); Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478
(1978) (requiring, upon defense request, jury instruction on presumption of inno-
cence); Kentucky v. Whorton, 441 U.S. 786 (1979) (fairness of failure to give jury
instruction on presumption of innocence evaluated under totality of circumstances);
Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979) (conclusive presumptions in jury instruc-
tion may not be used to shift burden of proof of an element of crime to defendant);
Hicks v. Oklahoma, 447 U.S. 343 (1980) (where sentencing enhancement scheme for
habitual offenders found unconstitutional, defendant’s sentence cannot be sus-
tained, even if sentence falls within range of unenhanced sentences).
     1021 Justice Black thought the Fourteenth Amendment should be limited to the

specific guarantees found in the Bill of Rights. See, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S.
358, 377 (1970) (dissenting). For Justice Harlan’s response, see id. at 372 n.5 (con-
curring).
