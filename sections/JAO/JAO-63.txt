tion.295 On the other hand, in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon,296
a Pennsylvania statute that forbade the mining of coal under pri-
vate dwellings or streets of cities by a grantor that had reserved
the right to mine was viewed as too restrictive on the use of pri-
vate property and hence a denial of due process and a “taking” with-
out compensation.297 Years later, however, a quite similar Pennsyl-
vania statute was upheld, the Court finding that the new law no
longer involved merely a balancing of private economic interests,
but instead promoted such “important public interests” as conserva-
tion, protection of water supplies, and preservation of land values
for taxation.298
    A statute requiring the destruction of cedar trees within two
miles of apple orchards in order to prevent damage to the orchards
caused by cedar rust was upheld as not unreasonable even in the
absence of compensation. Apple growing being one of the principal
agricultural pursuits in Virginia and the value of cedar trees through-
out the state being small as compared with that of apple orchards,
the state was constitutionally competent to require the destruction
of one class of property in order to save another which, in the judg-
ment of its legislature, was of greater value to the public.299 Simi-
larly, Florida was held to possess constitutional authority to pro-
tect the reputation of one of its major industries by penalizing the
delivery for shipment in interstate commerce of citrus fruits so im-
mature as to be unfit for consumption.300
    Water, Fish, and Game.—A statute making it unlawful for a
riparian owner to divert water into another state was held not to
deprive the property owner of due process. “The constitutional power
of the State to insist that its natural advantages shall remain un-
impaired by its citizens is not dependent upon any nice estimate of

     298 Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 488 (1987).

The Court in Pennsylvania Coal had viewed that case as relating to a “a single pri-
vate house.” 260 U.S. at 413. Also distinguished from Pennsylvania Coal was a chal-
lenge to an ordinance prohibiting sand and gravel excavation near the water table
and imposing a duty to refill any existing excavation below that level. The ordi-
nance was upheld; the fact that it prohibited a business that had been conducted
for over 30 years did not give rise to a taking in the absence of proof that the land
could not be used for other legitimate purposes. Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead,
