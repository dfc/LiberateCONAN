and largely overturned the limitations that the Mobile plurality had
attempted to impose in this area. With the enactment of federal
legislation specifically addressed to the issue of multimember district-
ing and dilution of the votes of racial minorities, however, it may
be that the Court will have little further opportunity to develop the
matter in the context of constitutional litigation.1963 In Thornburg
v. Gingles,1964 the Court held that multimember districting violates
§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of a racial
minority when that minority is “sufficiently large and geographi-
cally compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,”
when it is politically cohesive, and when block voting by the major-
ity “usually” defeats preferred candidates of the minority.
    Finally, the Court has approved the discretionary exercise of eq-
uity powers by the lower federal courts in drawing district bound-
aries and granting other relief in districting and apportionment
cases,1965 although that power is bounded by the constitutional vio-
lations found, so that courts do not have carte blanche, and they
should ordinarily respect the structural decisions made by state leg-
islatures and the state constitutions.1966

     1963 On the legislation, see “Congressional Definition of Fourteenth Amendment

Rights,” infra.
     1964 478 U.S. 30, 50–51 (1986). Use of multimember districting for purposes of

political gerrymandering was at issue in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986),
decided the same day as Gingles, but there was no agreement as to the appropriate
constitutional standard. A plurality led by Justice White relied on the Whitcomb v.
Chavis reasoning, suggesting that proof that multimember districts were con-
structed for the advantage of one political party falls short of the necessary showing
of deprivation of opportunity to participate in the electoral process. 478 U.S. at 136–
37. Two Justices thought the proof sufficient for a holding of invalidity, the minority
party having won 46% of the vote but only 3 of 21 seats from the multimember
districts, and “the only discernible pattern [being] the appearance of these districts
in areas where their winner-take-all aspects can best be employed to debase [one
party’s] voting strength,” (id. at 179–80, Justices Powell and Stevens), and three Jus-
tices thought political gerrymandering claims to be nonjusticiable.
     1965 E.g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 586–87 (1964); Sixty-Seventh Minne-

sota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.S. 187, 195–200 (1972); White v. Weiser, 412 U.S.
783, 794–95 (1973); Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37, 41–42 (1982). When courts draw
their own plans, the court is held to tighter standards than is a legislature and has
to observe smaller population deviations and use single-member districts more than
multi-member ones. Connor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690, 692 (1971); Chapman v. Meier,
420 U.S. 1, 14–21 (1975); Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978). Cf. Mahan v.
Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 333 (1973).
     1966 E.g., Sixty-Seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.S. 187 (1972)

(reduction of numbers of members); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 160–61 (1971)
(disregard of policy of multimember districts not found unconstitutional); White v.
Weiser, 412 U.S. 783, 794–95 (1973); Upham v. Seamon, 406 U.S. 37 (1982). But see
Karcher v. Daggett, 466 U.S. 910 (1983) (denying cert. over dissent’s suggestion that
court-adopted congressional districting plan had strayed too far from the structural
framework of the legislature’s invalidated plan).
