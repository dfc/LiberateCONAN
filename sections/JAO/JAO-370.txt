one-vote requirement, the only thing out of the ordinary with re-
spect to the Texas plan was that it was motivated solely by parti-
san considerations, and the plurality had already rejected the sole-
motivation theory.1954 League of United Latin American Citizens v.
Perry thus left earlier Court precedent essentially unchanged. Claims
of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are justiciable, but a
reliable measure of what constitutes unconstitutional partisan ger-
rymandering remains to be found.
     It had been thought that the use of multimember districts to
submerge racial, ethnic, and political minorities might be treated
differently,1955 but in Whitcomb v. Chavis 1956 the Court, while deal-
ing with the issue on the merits, so enveloped it in strict standards
of proof and definitional analysis as to raise the possibility that it
might be beyond judicial review. In Chavis the Court held that in-
asmuch as the multimember districting represented a state policy
of more than 100 years observance and could not therefore be said
to be motivated by racial or political bias, only an actual showing
that the multimember delegation in fact inadequately represented
the allegedly submerged minority would suffice to raise a constitu-
tional question. But the Court also rejected as impermissible the
argument that any interest group had any sort of right to be repre-
sented in a legislative body, in proportion to its members’ numbers
or on some other basis, so that the failure of that group to elect
anyone merely meant that alone or in combination with other groups
it simply lacked the strength to obtain enough votes, whether the
election be in single-member or in multimember districts. That fact
of life was not of constitutional dimension, whether the group was
composed of blacks, or Republicans or Democrats, or some other cat-
egory of persons. Thus, the submerging argument was rejected, as
was the argument of a voter in another county that the Court should
require uniform single-member districting in populous counties be-
cause voters in counties that elected large delegations in blocs had
in effect greater voting power than voters in other districts; this
argument the Court found too theoretical and too far removed from
the actualities of political life.
     Subsequently, and surprisingly in light of Chavis, the Court in
White v. Regester 1957 affirmed a district court invalidation of the use
of multimember districts in two Texas counties on the ground that,
