no jurisdiction is void.521 Apart from such restraints, however, a state
is free to adopt new remedies for the collection of taxes and even to
apply new remedies to taxes already delinquent.522
    Sufficiency and Manner of Giving Notice.—Notice of tax as-
sessments or liabilities, insofar as it is required, may be either per-
sonal, by publication, by statute fixing the time and place of hear-
ing,523 or by delivery to a statutorily designated agent.524 As regards
land, “where the State . . . [desires] to sell land for taxes upon pro-
ceedings to enforce a lien for the payment thereof, it may proceed
directly against the land within the jurisdiction of the court, and a
notice which permits all interested, who are ‘so minded,’ to ascer-
tain that it is to be subjected to sale to answer for taxes, and to
appear and be heard, whether to be found within the jurisdiction
or not, is due process of law within the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. . . .” In fact, compliance with statutory notice requirements
combined with actual notice to owners of land can be sufficient in
an in rem case, even if there are technical defects in such notice.525
    Whether statutorily required notice is sufficient may vary with
the circumstances. Thus, where a taxpayer was not legally compe-
tent, no guardian had been appointed and town officials were aware
of these facts, notice of a foreclosure was defective, even though the
tax delinquency was mailed to her, published in local papers, and
posted in the town post office.526 On the other hand, due process
was not denied to appellants who were unable to avert foreclosure

     525 Leigh v. Green, 193 U.S. 79, 92–93 (1904). Thus, an assessment for taxes

and a notice of sale when such taxes are delinquent will be sustained as long as
there is a description of the land and the owner knows that the property so de-
scribed is his, even if that description is not technically correct. Ontario Land Co. v.
Yordy, 212 U.S. 152 (1909). Where tax proceedings are in rem, owners are bound to
take notice thereof, and to pay taxes on their property, even if the land is assessed
to unknown or other persons. Thus, if an owner stands by and sees his property
sold for delinquent taxes, he is not thereby wrongfully deprived of his property. Id.
