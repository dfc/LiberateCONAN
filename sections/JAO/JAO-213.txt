and in the Mullaney v. Wilbur line of cases clearly shows the un-
settled nature of the issues they concern.
    The Problem of the Incompetent or Insane Defendant.—It
is a denial of due process to try or sentence a defendant who is
insane or incompetent to stand trial.1133 When it becomes evident
during the trial that a defendant is or has become insane or incom-
petent to stand trial, the court on its own initiative must conduct a
hearing on the issue.1134 Although there is no constitutional require-
ment that the state assume the burden of proving a defendant com-
petent, the state must provide the defendant with a chance to prove
that he is incompetent to stand trial. Thus, a statutory presump-
tion that a criminal defendant is competent to stand trial or a re-
quirement that the defendant bear the burden of proving incompe-
tence by a preponderance of the evidence does not violate due
process.1135
     When a state determines that a person charged with a crimi-
nal offense is incompetent to stand trial, he cannot be committed
indefinitely for that reason. The court’s power is to commit him to
a period no longer than is necessary to determine whether there is
a substantial probability that he will attain his capacity in the fore-
seeable future. If it is determined that he will not, then the state
must either release the defendant or institute the customary civil
commitment proceeding that would be required to commit any other
citizen.1136
     Where a defendant is found competent to stand trial, a state
appears to have significant discretion in how it takes account of men-
tal illness or defect at the time of the offense in determining crimi-

     1133 Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378 (1966) (citing Bishop v. United States,

350 U.S. 961 (1956)). The standard for competency to stand trial is whether the
defendant “has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reason-
able degree of rational understanding—and whether he has a rational as well as
factual understanding of the proceedings against him.” Dusky v. United States, 362
U.S. 402 (1960) (per curiam), cited with approval in Indiana v. Edwards, 128 S. Ct.
2379, 2383 (2008). The fact that a defendant is mentally competent to stand trial
does not preclude a court from finding him not mentally competent to represent him-
self at trial. Indiana v. Edwards, supra.
     1134 Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378 (1966). For treatment of the circum-

stances when a trial court should inquire into the mental competency of the defen-
dant, see Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162 (1975). Also, an indigent who makes a
preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of his offense will be a substantial
factor in his trial is entitled to a court-appointed psychiatrist to assist in presenting
the defense. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985).
     1135 Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437 (1992). It is a violation of due process,

however, for a state to require that a defendant must prove competence to stand
trial by clear and convincing evidence. Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S. 348 (1996).
     1136 Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972).
