     The Court also appeared to have expanded the notion of “lib-
erty” to include the right to be free of official stigmatization, and
found that such threatened stigmatization could in and of itself re-
quire due process.797 Thus, in Wisconsin v. Constantineau,798 the Court
invalidated a statutory scheme in which persons could be labeled
“excessive drinkers,” without any opportunity for a hearing and re-
buttal, and could then be barred from places where alcohol was served.
The Court, without discussing the source of the entitlement, noted
that the governmental action impugned the individual’s reputa-
tion, honor, and integrity.799
     But, in Paul v. Davis,800 the Court appeared to retreat from rec-
ognizing damage to reputation alone, holding instead that the lib-
erty interest extended only to those situations where loss of one’s
reputation also resulted in loss of a statutory entitlement. In Da-
vis, the police had included plaintiff ’s photograph and name on a
list of “active shoplifters” circulated to merchants without an oppor-
tunity for notice or hearing. But the Court held that “Kentucky law
does not extend to respondent any legal guarantee of present enjoy-
ment of reputation which has been altered as a result of petition-
ers’ actions. Rather, his interest in reputation is simply one of a
number which the State may protect against injury by virtue of its
tort law, providing a forum for vindication of those interest by means
of damage actions.” 801 Thus, unless the government’s official defa-
mation has a specific negative effect on an entitlement, such as the
denial to “excessive drinkers” of the right to obtain alcohol that oc-
curred in Constantineau, there is no protected liberty interest that
would require due process.

ated entitlements involve prisoner rights, and are dealt with more

     801 Here the Court, 424 U.S. at 701–10, distinguished Constantineau as being a

“reputation-plus” case. That is, it involved not only the stigmatizing of one posted
but it also “deprived the individual of a right previously held under state law—the
right to purchase or obtain liquor in common with the rest of the citizenry.” 424

course, the reputation-plus concept is now well-settled. See discussion below. See also
