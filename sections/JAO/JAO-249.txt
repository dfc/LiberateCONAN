    Attempts to apply this theory to other kinds of private conduct,
such as operation of private utilities,1327 use of permissive state laws
to secure property claimed to belong to creditors,1328 maintaining
schools for “problem” children referred by public institutions,1329 pro-
vision of workers’ compensation coverage by private insurance com-
panies,1330 and operation of nursing homes in which patient care is
almost all funded by public resources,1331 proved unavailing. The
question is not “whether a private group is serving a ‘public func-
tion.’ . . . That a private entity performs a function which serves
the public does not make its acts state action.” 1332 The “public func-
tion” doctrine is to be limited to a delegation of “a power ‘tradition-
ally exclusively reserved to the State.’ ” 1333
     Public function did play an important part, however, in the Court’s
finding state action in the exercise of peremptory challenges in jury
selection by non-governmental parties. Using tests developed in an
earlier case involving garnishment and attachment,1334 the Court
found state action in the racially discriminatory use of such chal-
lenges during voir dire in a civil case.1335 The Court first asked
“whether the claimed constitutional deprivation resulted from the
exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority,”
and then “whether the private party charged with the deprivation
could be described in all fairness as a state actor.” In answering
the second question, the Court considered three factors: “the extent
to which the actor relies on governmental assistance and benefits,
whether the actor is performing a traditional governmental func-
tion, and whether the injury caused is aggravated in a unique way
by the incidents of governmental authority.” 1336 There was no ques-
tion that the exercise of peremptory challenges derives from govern-
mental authority (either state or federal, as the case may be); exer-
cise of peremptory challenges is authorized by law, and the number
is limited. Similarly, the Court easily concluded that private par-
ties exercise peremptory challenges with the “overt” and “signifi-
cant” assistance of the court.
