sons predisposed to engage in specific criminal behaviors. In Kansas
v. Hendricks,690 the Court upheld a Kansas law that allowed civil
commitment without a showing of “mental illness,” so that a defen-
dant diagnosed as a pedophile could be committed based on his hav-
ing a “mental abnormality” that made him “likely to engage in acts
of sexual violence.” Although the Court minimized the use of this
expanded nomenclature,691 the concept of “mental abnormality” ap-
pears both more encompassing and less defined than the concept of
“mental illness.” It is unclear how, or whether, the Court would dis-
tinguish this case from the indefinite civil commitment of other re-
cidivists such as drug offenders. A subsequent opinion does seem to
narrow the Hendricks holding so as to require an additional find-
ing that the defendant would have difficulty controlling his or her
behavior.692
    Still other issues await exploration.693 Additionally, federal leg-
islation is becoming extensive,694 and state legislative and judicial
development of law is highly important because the Supreme Court
looks to this law as one source of the interests that the Due Pro-
cess Clause protects.695
    “Right to Die”.—Although the popular term “right to die” has
been used to describe the debate over end-of-life decisions, the un-
derlying issues include a variety of legal concepts, some distinct and
some overlapping. For instance, “right to die” could include issues
of suicide, passive euthanasia (allowing a person to die by refusal
or withdrawal of medical intervention), assisted suicide (providing
a person the means of committing suicide), active euthanasia (kill-
ing another), and palliative care (providing comfort care which ac-
celerates the death process). Recently, a new category has been

ing that a state can not hold a person suffering from a personality disorder without
clear and convincing proof of a mental illness).

L. REV. 1190 (1974). In Mills v. Rogers, 457 U.S. 291 (1982), the Court had before it
the issue of the due process right of committed mental patients at state hospitals to
refuse administration of antipsychotic drugs. An intervening decision of the state’s
highest court had measurably strengthened the patients’ rights under both state and
federal law and the Court remanded for reconsideration in light of the state court
decision. See also Rennie v. Klein, 653 F.2d 836 (3d Cir. 1981).
