    Marriage.—Statutes that forbid the contracting of marriage be-
tween persons of different races are unconstitutional,1704 as are stat-
utes that penalize interracial cohabitation.1705 Nor may a court deny
custody of a child based on a parent’s remarriage to a person of
another race and the presumed “best interests of the child” to be
free from the prejudice and stigmatization that might result.1706
    Judicial System.—Segregation in courtrooms is unlawful and
may not be enforced through contempt citations for disobedi-
ence 1707 or through other means. Treatment of parties to or wit-
nesses in judicial actions based on their race is impermissible.1708
Jail inmates have a right not to be segregated by race unless there
is some overriding necessity arising out of the process of keeping
order.1709
    Public Designation.—It is unconstitutional to designate can-
didates on the ballot by race 1710 and apparently any sort of desig-
nation by race on public records is suspect, although not necessar-
ily unlawful.1711
    Public Accommodations.—Whether discrimination practiced
by operators of retail selling and service establishments gave rise
to a denial of constitutional rights occupied the Court’s attention
considerably in the early 1960s, but it avoided finally deciding one
way or the other, generally finding forbidden state action in some
aspect of the situation.1712 Passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
obviated any necessity to resolve the issue.1713
    Elections .—Although, of course, the denial of the franchise on
the basis of race or color violates the Fifteenth Amendment and a

voting, tax and property records).
