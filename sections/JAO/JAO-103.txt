rights of man’ ” and a “fundamental freedom.” “The freedom to marry
has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essen-
tial to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men,” and the clas-
sification of marriage rights on a racial basis was “unsupportable.”
Further development of this line of cases was slowed by the ex-
panded application of the Bill of Rights to the states, which af-
forded the Court an alternative ground to void state policies.549
    Despite the Court’s increasing willingness to overturn state leg-
islation, the basis and standard of review that the Court would use
to review infringements on “fundamental freedoms” were not al-
ways clear. In Poe v. Ullman,550 for instance, the Court dismissed
as non-justiciable a suit challenging a Connecticut statute banning
the use of contraceptives, even by married couples. In dissent, how-
ever, Justice Harlan advocated the application of a due process stan-
dard of reasonableness—the same lenient standard he would have
applied to test economic legislation.551 Applying a lengthy analysis,
Justice Harlan concluded that the statute in question infringed upon
a fundamental liberty without the showing of a justification which
would support the intrusion. Yet, when the same issue returned to
the Court in Griswold v. Connecticut,552 a majority of the Justices
rejected reliance on substantive due process 553 and instead decided
it on another basis—that the statute was an invasion of privacy,
which was a non-textual “penumbral” right protected by a matrix

      549 Indeed, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965), Justice Doug-

las reinterpreted Meyer and Pierce as having been based on the First Amendment.
Note also that in Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 105 (1968), and Tinker v. Des
Moines Indep. Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506–07 (1969), Justice Fortas
for the Court approvingly noted the due process basis of Meyer and Pierce while
deciding both cases on First Amendment grounds.
      550 367 U.S. 497, 522, 539–45 (1961). Justice Douglas, also dissenting, relied on

a due process analysis, which began with the texts of the first eight Amendments as
the basis of fundamental due process and continued into the “emanations” from this
as also protected. Id. at 509.
      551 According to Justice Harlan, due process is limited neither to procedural guar-

antees nor to the rights enumerated in the first eight Amendments of the Bill of
Rights, but is rather “a discrete concept which subsists as an independent guaranty
of liberty and procedural fairness, more general and inclusive than the specific pro-
hibitions.” The liberty protected by the clause “is a rational continuum which, broadly
speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purpose-
less restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judg-
ment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state
needs asserted to justify their abridgment.” 367 U.S. at 542, 543.
      552 381 U.S. 479 (1965).
      553 “We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and

propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social condi-
tions.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 482 (opinion of Court by Justice Doug-
las).
