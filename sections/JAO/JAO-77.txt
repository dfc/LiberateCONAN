his estate, constitutionally may be imposed on the shares of lega-
tees, notwithstanding that under the law of the state in effect on
the date of such enactment, ownership of the property passed to
the legatees upon the testatorâ€™s death.400 Equally consistent with
due process is a tax on an inter vivos transfer of property by deed
intended to take effect upon the death of the grantor.401
    The taxation of entities that are franchises within the jurisdic-
tion of the governing body raises few concerns. Thus, a city ordi-
nance imposing annual license taxes on light and power companies
does not violate the Due Process Clause merely because the city
has entered the power business in competition with such compa-
nies.402 Nor does a municipal charter authorizing the imposition upon
a local telegraph company of a tax upon the lines of the company
within its limits at the rate at which other property is taxed but
upon an arbitrary valuation per mile, deprive the company of its
property without due process of law, inasmuch as the tax is a mere
franchise or privilege tax.403
     States have significant discretion in how to value real property
for tax purposes. Thus, assessment of properties for tax purposes
over real market value is allowed as merely another way of achiev-
ing an increase in the rate of property tax, and does not violate
due process.404 Likewise, land subject to mortgage may be taxed for
its full value without deduction of the mortgage debt from the valu-
ation.405
    A state also has wide discretion in how to apportion real prop-
erty tax burdens. Thus, a state may defray the entire expense of
creating, developing, and improving a political subdivision either from
funds raised by general taxation, by apportioning the burden among
the municipalities in which the improvements are made, or by cre-
ating (or authorizing the creation of) tax districts to meet sanc-
tioned outlays.406 Or, where a state statute authorizes municipal au-
thorities to define the district to be benefitted by a street improvement
and to assess the cost of the improvement upon the property within
the district in proportion to benefits, their action in establishing the
district and in fixing the assessments on included property, cannot,
if not arbitrary or fraudulent, be reviewed under the Fourteenth
