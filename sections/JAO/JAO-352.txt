zenship and denies the franchise to others, the Court must deter-

state interest.”
    “And, for these reasons, the deference usually given to the judg-
ment of legislators does not extend to decisions concerning which
resident citizens may participate in the election of legislators and
other public officials. . . . [W]hen we are reviewing statutes which
deny some residents the right to vote, the general presumption of
constitutionality afforded state statutes and the traditional ap-
proval given state classifications if the Court can conceive of a ‘ra-
tional basis’ for the distinctions made are not applicable.” 1863 Us-
ing this analytical approach, the Court has established a regime of
close review of a vast range of state restrictions on the eligibility to
vote, on access to the ballot by candidates and parties, and on the
weighing of votes cast through the devices of apportionment and
districting. Changes in Court membership over the years has led
to some relaxation in the application of principles, but even as the
Court has drawn back in other areas it has tended to preserve, both
doctrinally and in fact, the election cases.1864
    Voter Qualifications.—States may require residency as a quali-
fication to vote, but “durational residence laws . . . are unconstitu-
tional unless the State can demonstrate that such laws are neces-
sary to promote a compelling governmental interest.” 1865 The Court
applies “[t]his exacting test” because the right to vote is “a funda-
mental political right, . . . preservative of all rights,” and because
a “durational residence requirement directly impinges on the exer-

78 (1973), a major doctrinal effort to curb the “fundamental interest” side of the
“new” equal protection, the Court acknowledged that the right to vote did not come
within its prescription that rights to be deemed fundamental must be explicitly or
implicitly guaranteed in the Constitution. Nonetheless, citizens have a “constitution-
ally protected right to participate in elections,” which is protected by the Equal Pro-
tection Clause. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336 (1972). The franchise is the
guardian of all other rights. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964).
     1865 Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 342 (1972) (internal quotation marks omit-

ted, emphasis added by the Court) (striking down a Tennessee statute that imposed
a requirement of one year in the state and three months in the county). The Court
did not indicate what, if any, shorter duration it would permit, although it noted
that, in the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 316, 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa–1,
“Congress outlawed State durational residence requirements for presidential and vice-
presidential elections, and prohibited the States from closing registration more than
30 days before Congress prescribed a thirty-day period for purposes of voting in presi-
dential elections.” Id. at 344. Note also that it does not matter whether one travels
interstate or intrastate. Hadnott v. Amos, 320 F. Supp. 107 (M.D. Ala. 1970), aff’d,
