cinctly, “statutes create many classifications which do not deny equal
protection; it is only ‘invidious discrimination’ which offends the Con-
stitution.” 1383
     How then is the line between permissible and invidious classi-
fication to be determined? In Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co.,1384
the Court summarized one version of the rules still prevailing. “1.
The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not
take from the State the power to classify in the adoption of police
laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that
regard, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reason-
able basis and therefore is purely arbitrary. 2. A classification hav-
ing some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely
because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in prac-
tice it results in some inequality. 3. When the classification in such
a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be
conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts
at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4. One who as-
sails the classification in such a law must carry the burden of show-
ing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essen-
tially arbitrary.” Especially because of the emphasis upon the necessity
for total arbitrariness, utter irrationality, and the fact that the Court
will strain to conceive of a set of facts that will justify the classifi-
cation, the test is extremely lenient and, assuming the existence of
a constitutionally permissible goal, no classification will ever be up-
set. But, contemporaneously with this test, the Court also pro-
nounced another lenient standard which did leave to the courts a
judgmental role. In F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia,1385 the court
put forward the following test: “[T]he classification must be reason-
able, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference
having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legisla-

463–64 (1957). Classifications which are purposefully discriminatory fall before the
Equal Protection Clause without more. E.g., Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27, 30
(1885); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373–74 (1886). Cf. New York City Transit
Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 593 n.40 (1979). Explicit in all the formulations is
that a legislature must have had a permissible purpose, a requirement which is sel-
dom failed, given the leniency of judicial review. But see Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S.
55, 63–64 (1982), and id. at 65 (Justice Brennan concurring).
