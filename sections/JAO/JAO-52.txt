precluded from shifting such burdens. Thus, a statute may make
an initial rail carrier,215 or the connecting or delivering carrier,216
liable to the shipper for the nondelivery of goods which results from
the fault of another, as long as the carrier has a subrogated right
to proceed against the carrier at fault. Similarly, a railroad may be
held responsible for damages to the owner of property injured by
fire caused by locomotive engines, as the statute also granted the
railroad an insurable interest in such property along its route, al-
lowing the railroad to procure insurance against such liability.217
Equally consistent with the requirements of due process are enact-
ments imposing on all common carriers a penalty for failure to settle
claims for freight lost or damaged in shipment within a reasonable
specified period.218
    The Court has, however, established some limits on the imposi-
tion of penalties on common carriers. During the Lochner era, the
Court invalidated an award of $500 in liquidated damages plus rea-
sonable attorney’s fees imposed on a carrier that had collected trans-
portation charges in excess of established maximum rates as dispro-
portionate. The Court also noted that the penalty was exacted under
conditions not affording the carrier an adequate opportunity to test
the constitutionality of the rates before liability attached.219 Where
the carrier did have an opportunity to challenge the reasonable-
ness of the rate, however, the Court indicated that the validity of
the penalty imposed need not be determined by comparison with
the amount of the overcharge. Inasmuch as a penalty is imposed
as punishment for violation of law, the legislature may adjust its
amount to the public wrong rather than the private injury, and the
only limitation which the Fourteenth Amendment imposes is that
the penalty prescribed shall not be “so severe and oppressive as to
be wholly disproportionate to the offense and obviously unreason-
able.” 220
