missal decisions based on academic grounds.780
     The further one gets from traditional precepts of property, the
more difficult it is to establish a due process claim based on entitle-
ments. In Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales,781 the Court considered
whether police officers violated a constitutionally protected prop-
erty interest by failing to enforce a restraining order obtained by
an estranged wife against her husband, despite having probable cause
to believe the order had been violated. While noting statutory lan-
guage that required that officers either use “every reasonable means
to enforce [the] restraining order” or “seek a warrant for the arrest
of the restrained person,” the Court resisted equating this lan-
guage with the creation of an enforceable right, noting a long-
standing tradition of police discretion coexisting with apparently man-
datory arrest statutes.782 Finally, the Court even questioned whether
finding that the statute contained mandatory language would have
created a property right, as the wife, with no criminal enforcement
authority herself, was merely an indirect recipient of the benefits
of the governmental enforcement scheme.783
     In Arnett v. Kennedy,784 an incipient counter-revolution to the
expansion of due process was rebuffed, at least with respect to en-
titlements. Three Justices sought to qualify the principle laid down
in the entitlement cases and to restore in effect much of the right-
privilege distinction, albeit in a new formulation. The case in-
volved a federal law that provided that employees could not be dis-
charged except for cause, and the Justices acknowledged that due
process rights could be created through statutory grants of entitle-
ments. The Justices, however, observed that the same law specifi-
cally withheld the procedural protections now being sought by the
employees. Because “the property interest which appellee had in his

though the Court “assume[d] the existence of a constitutionally protectible property
interest in . . . continued enrollment” in a state university, this limited constitu-
tional right is violated only by a showing that dismissal resulted from “such a sub-
stantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person
or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.” 474 U.S.

cise means of enforcement required; nor did it guarantee that, if a warrant were
sought, it would be issued. Such indeterminancy is not the “hallmark of a duty that
is mandatory.” Id. at 763.
