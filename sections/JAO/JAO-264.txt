lenge, “serve important governmental objectives and must be sub-
stantially related to achievement of those objectives.” 1415 And clas-
sifications that disadvantage illegitimates are subject to a similar
though less exacting scrutiny of purpose and fit.1416 This period also
saw a withdrawal of the Court from the principle that alienage is
always a suspect classification, so that some discriminations against
aliens based on the nature of the political order, rather than eco-
nomics or social interests, need pass only the lenient review stan-
dard.1417
    The Court has so far resisted further expansion of classifica-
tions that must be justified by a standard more stringent than ra-
tional basis. For example, the Court has held that age classifica-

the precedents made clear that gender classifications are subjected to more critical
examination than when “fundamental” rights and “suspect classes” are absent, id.
at 210 (concurring), and added: “As is evident from our opinions, the Court has had
difficulty in agreeing upon a standard of equal protection analysis that can be ap-
plied consistently to the wide variety of legislative classifications. There are valid
reasons for dissatisfaction with the ‘two-tier’ approach that has been prominent in
the Court’s decisions in the past decade. Although viewed by many as a result-
oriented substitute for more critical analysis, that approach—with its narrowly lim-
ited ‘upper tier’—now has substantial precedential support. As has been true of Reed
and its progeny, our decision today will be viewed by some as a ‘middle-tier’ ap-
proach. While I would not endorse that characterization and would not welcome a
further subdividing of equal protection analysis, candor compels the recognition that
the relatively deferential ‘rational basis’ standard of review normally applied takes
on a sharper focus when we address a gender-based classification. So much is clear
from our recent cases.” Id. at 210, n.*. Justice Stevens wrote that in his view the
two-tiered analysis does not describe a method of deciding cases “but rather is a
method the Court has employed to explain decisions that actually apply a single
standard in a reasonably consistent fashion.” Id. at 211, 212. Chief Justice Burger
and Justice Rehnquist would employ the rational basis test for gender classifica-
tion. Id. at 215, 217 (dissenting). Occasionally, because of the particular subject mat-
ter, the Court has appeared to apply a rational basis standard in fact if not in doc-
trine, E.g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) (military); Michael M. v. Superior
Court, 450 U.S. 464 (1981) (application of statutory rape prohibition to boys but not
to girls). Four Justices in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684–87 (1973), were
prepared to find sex a suspect classification, and in Mississippi Univ. for Women v.
Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 n.9 (1982), the Court appeared to leave open the possibil-
ity that at least some sex classifications may be deemed suspect.

347 (1979); Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259 (1978); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762 (1977).
In Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 506 (1976), it was said that “discrimination against
illegitimates has never approached the severity or pervasiveness of the historic le-
gal and political discrimination against women and Negroes.” Lucas sustained a statu-
tory scheme virtually identical to the one struck down in Califano v. Goldfarb, 430
U.S. 199 (1977), except that the latter involved sex while the former involved illegiti-
macy.

Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1 (1977). Applying lenient scrutiny in cases involving
restrictions on alien entry into the political community, see Foley v. Connelie, 435
U.S. 291 (1978); Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68 (1979); Cabell v. Chavez-Salido,
454 U.S. 432 (1982). See also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982).
