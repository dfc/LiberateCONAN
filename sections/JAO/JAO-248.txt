mental action and need not follow the dictates of the Due Process
Clause.1320 Or, where a state workers’ compensation statute was
amended to allow, but not require, an insurer to suspend payment
for medical treatment while the necessity of the treatment was be-
ing evaluated by an independent evaluator, this action was not fairly
attributable to the state, and thus pre-deprivation notice of the sus-
pension was not required.1321 In the context of regulated nursing
home situations, in which the homes were closely regulated and state
officials reduced or withdrew Medicaid benefits paid to patients when
they were discharged or transferred to institutions providing a lower
level of care, the Court found that the actions of the homes in dis-
charging or transferring were not thereby rendered the actions of
the government.1322
      In a few cases, the Court has indicated that discriminatory ac-
tion by private parties may be precluded by the Fourteenth Amend-
ment if the particular party involved is exercising a “public func-
tion.” 1323 For instance, in Marsh v. Alabama,1324 a Jehovah’s Witness
had been convicted of trespass after passing out literature on the
streets of a company-owned town, but the Court reversed. It is not
entirely clear from the Court’s opinion what it was that made the
privately owned town one to which the Constitution applied. In es-
sence, it appears to have been that the town “had all the character-
istics of any other American town” and that it was “like” a state.
“The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for
use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circum-
scribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use
it.” 1325 A subsequent attempt to extend Marsh to privately owned
shopping centers was at first successful, but was soon turned back,
resulting in a sharp curtailment of the “public function” doc-
trine.1326

in securing the property in dispute, that is sufficient to create the requisite state
action and the private party may be subjected to suit if the seizure does not com-
port with due process. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982).

     1323 This rationale is one of those that emerges from various opinions in Terry

v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953) (holding that a political association limited to white
voters that held internal elections to designate which of its member would run in
the Texas Democratic primaries was acting as part of the state-established electoral
system).

Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976). The Marsh principle is good only when pri-
vate property has taken on all the attributes of a municipality. Id. at 516–17.
