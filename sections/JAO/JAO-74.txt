late due process.379 Nor does a law that lifts a statute of limita-
tions and makes possible a suit, previously barred, for the value of
certain securities. “The Fourteenth Amendment does not make an
act of state legislation void merely because it has some retrospec-
tive operation. . . . Some rules of law probably could not be changed
retroactively without hardship and oppression . . . . Assuming that
statutes of limitation, like other types of legislation, could be so ma-
nipulated that their retroactive effects would offend the constitu-
tion, certainly it cannot be said that lifting the bar of a statute of
limitation so as to restore a remedy lost through mere lapse of time
is per se an offense against the Fourteenth Amendment.” 380

State Control over Local Units of Government
     The Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive a state of the power
to determine what duties may be performed by local officers, and
whether they shall be appointed or popularly elected.381 Nor does a
statute requiring cities to indemnify owners of property damaged
by mobs or during riots result in an unconstitutional deprivation of
the property, even when the city could not have prevented the vio-
lence.382 Likewise, a person obtaining a judgment against a munici-
pality for damages resulting from a riot is not deprived of property
without due process of law by an act that so limits the municipali-
ty’s taxing power as to prevent collection of funds adequate to pay
it. As long as the judgment continues as an existing liability, no
unconstitutional deprivation is experienced.383
     Local units of government obliged to surrender property to other
units newly created out of the territory of the former cannot suc-
cessfully invoke the Due Process Clause,384 nor may taxpayers al-
lege any unconstitutional deprivation as a result of changes in their
tax burden attendant upon the consolidation of contiguous munici-
palities.385 Nor is a statute requiring counties to reimburse cities
of the first class but not cities of other classes for rebates allowed
for prompt payment of taxes in conflict with the Due Process Clause.386
