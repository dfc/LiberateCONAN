the ‘minimum contacts’ with that State that are a prerequisite to
its exercise of power over him.” The only contacts the corporate de-
fendants had in Florida consisted of a relationship with the indi-
vidual defendants. “The unilateral activity of those who claim some
relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the require-
ment of contact with the forum State. The application of that rule
will vary with the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity,
but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the
defendant purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting
activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and
protections of its laws. . . . The settlor’s execution in Florida of her
power of appointment cannot remedy the absence of such an act in
this case.” 893
     The Court continued to apply International Shoe principles in
diverse situations. Thus, circulation of a magazine in a state was
an adequate basis for that state to exercise jurisdiction over an out-
of-state corporate magazine publisher in a libel action. The fact that
the plaintiff did not have “minimum contacts” with the forum state
was not dispositive since the relevant inquiry is the relations among
the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.894 Or, damage done to
the plaintiff ’s reputation in his home state caused by circulation of
a defamatory magazine article there may justify assertion of juris-
diction over the out-of-state authors of such article, despite the lack
of minimum contact between the authors (as opposed to the publish-
ers) and the state.895 Further, though there is no per se rule that a
contract with an out-of-state party automatically establishes juris-
diction to enforce the contract in the other party’s forum, a franchi-
see who has entered into a franchise contract with an out-of-state
corporation may be subject to suit in the corporation’s home state
where the overall circumstances (contract terms themselves, course

dants and the subject of the litigation to the Florida made Florida the natural and
constitutional basis for asserting jurisdiction. 357 U.S. at 251, 258–59. The Court
has numerous times asserted that contacts sufficient for the purpose of designating
a particular state’s law as appropriate may be insufficient for the purpose of assert-
ing jurisdiction. See Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 215 (1977); Kulko v. Superior
Court, 436 U.S. 84, 98 (1978); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S.
