ers.290 Generally, whether a system of proration is fair is a ques-
tion for administrative and not judicial judgment.291 On the other
hand, where the evidence showed that an order prorating allowed
production among several wells was actually intended to compel pipe-
line owners to furnish a market to those who had no pipeline con-
nections, the order was held void as a taking of private property
for private benefit.292
    A state may act to conserve resources even if it works to the
economic detriment of the producer. Thus, a state may forbid cer-
tain uses of natural gas, such as the production of carbon black,
where the gas is burned without fully using the heat therein for
other manufacturing or domestic purposes. Such regulations were
sustained even where the carbon black was more valuable than the
gas from which it was extracted, and notwithstanding the fact that
the producer had made significant investment in a plant for the manu-
facture of carbon black.293 Likewise, for the purpose of regulating
and adjusting coexisting rights of surface owners to underlying oil
and gas, it is within the power of a state to prohibit the operators
of wells from allowing natural gas, not conveniently necessary for
other purposes, to come to the surface unless its lifting power was
used to produce the greatest proportional quantity of oil.294
     Protection of Property and Agricultural Crops.—Special pre-
cautions may be required to avoid or compensate for harm caused
by extraction of natural resources. Thus, a state may require the
filing of a bond to secure payment for damages to any persons or
property resulting from an oil and gas drilling or production opera-

    290 This can be done regardless of whether the benefit is to the owners of oil

and gas in a common reservoir or because of the public interests involved. Thomp-
son v. Consolidated Gas Co., 300 U.S. 55, 76–77 (1937) (citing Ohio Oil Co. v. Indi-
ana (No. 1), 177 U.S. 190 (1900)); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S.
61 (1911); Oklahoma v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U.S. 229 (1911). Thus, the Court
upheld against due process challenge a statute that defined waste as including, in
addition to its ordinary meaning, economic waste, surface waste, and production in
excess of transportation or marketing facilities or reasonable market demands, and
which limited each producer’s share to a prorated portion of the total production
that can be taken from the common source without waste. Champlin Rfg. Co. v. Cor-
poration Comm’n, 286 U.S. 210 (1932).

ing whether proration based on hourly potential is as fair as one based upon esti-
mated recoverable reserves or some other combination of factors). See also Railroad
