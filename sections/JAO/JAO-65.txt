were still a “legitimate” basis for regulation, these concerns could
not justify disproportionate burdens on interstate commerce.311
    Subsequently, in the context of recreational rather than commer-
cial activity, the Court reached a result more deferential to state
authority, holding that access to recreational big game hunting is
not within the category of rights protected by the Privileges or Im-
munities Clause, and that consequently a state could charge out-of-
staters significantly more than in-staters for a hunting license.312
Suffice it to say that similar cases involving a state’s efforts to re-
serve its fish and game for its own inhabitants are likely to be chal-
lenged under commerce or privileges or immunities principles, rather
than under substantive due process.

Ownership of Real Property: Rights and Limitations
    Zoning and Similar Actions.—It is now well established that
states and municipalities have the police power to zone land for des-
ignated uses. Zoning authority gained judicial recognition early in
the 20th century. Initially, an analogy was drawn to public nui-
sance law, so that states and their municipal subdivisions could de-
clare that specific businesses, although not nuisances per se, were
nuisances in fact and in law in particular circumstances and in par-
ticular localities.313 Thus, a state could declare the emission of dense
smoke in populous areas a nuisance and restrain it, even though
this affected the use of property and subjected the owner to the ex-
pense of compliance.314 Similarly, the Court upheld an ordinance
that prohibited brick making in a designated area, even though the
specified land contained valuable clay deposits which could not prof-
itably be removed for processing elsewhere, was far more valuable
for brick making than for any other purpose, had been acquired be-
fore it was annexed to the municipality, and had long been used as
a brickyard.315
    With increasing urbanization came a broadening of the philoso-
phy of land-use regulation to protect not only health and safety but
also the amenities of modern living.316 Consequently, the Court has
recognized the power of government, within the loose confines of
    311  441 U.S. at 336, 338–39.

within a thickly populated city “is well within the range of the power of the state to
legislate for the health and general welfare”). See also Fischer v. St. Louis, 194 U.S.

bracing a rather special set of facts, see Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U.S. 223 (1904).
