was replaced by the civil liberty which an individual enjoys by vir-
tue of the restraints which government, in his behalf, imposes upon
his neighbors.
    Laws Regulating Working Conditions and Wages.—As noted,
even during the Lochner era, the Due Process Clause was con-
strued as permitting enactment by the states of maximum hours
laws applicable to women workers 104 and to all workers in speci-
fied lines of work thought to be physically demanding or otherwise
worthy of special protection.105 Similarly, the regulation of how wages
were to be paid was allowed, including the form of payment,106 its
frequency,107 and how such payment was to be calculated.108 And,
because of the almost plenary powers of the state and its munici-
pal subdivisions to determine the conditions for work on public proj-
ects, statutes limiting the hours of labor on public works were also
upheld at a relatively early date.109 Further, states could prohibit
the employment of persons under 16 years of age in dangerous oc-
cupations and require employers to ascertain whether their employ-
ees were in fact below that age.110
    The regulation of mines represented a further exception to the
Lochner era’s anti-discrimination tally. As such health and safety
regulation was clearly within a state’s police power, a state’s laws
providing for mining inspectors (paid for by mine owners),111 licens-
     104 Miller v. Wilson, 236 U.S. 373 (1915) (statute limiting work to 8 hours/day,

48 hours/week); Bosley v. McLaughlin, 236 U.S. 385 (1915) (same restrictions for
women working as pharmacists or student nurses). See also Muller v. Oregon, 208
U.S. 412 (1908) (10 hours/day as applied to work in laundries); Riley v. Massachu-
setts, 232 U.S. 671 (1914) (violation of lunch hour required to be posted).
     105 See, e.g., Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 (1898) (statute limiting the hours of

labor in mines and smelters to eight hours per day); Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U.S.
426 (1917) (statute limiting to ten hours per day, with the possibility of 3 hours per
day of overtime at time-and-a-half pay, work in any mill, factory, or manufacturing
establishment).
     106 Statute requiring redemption in cash of store orders or other evidences of

indebtedness issued by employers in payment of wages did not violate liberty of con-
tract. Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, 183 U.S. 13 (1901); Dayton Coal and Iron Co.
v. Barton, 183 U.S. 23 (1901); Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, 234 U.S. 224 (1914).
     107 Laws requiring railroads to pay their employees semimonthly, Erie R.R. v.

Williams, 233 U.S. 685 (1914), or to pay them on the day of discharge, without abate-
ment or reduction, any funds due them, St. Louis, I. Mt. & S.P. Ry. v. Paul, 173 U.S.
404 (1899), do not violate due process.
     108 Freedom of contract was held not to be infringed by an act requiring that

miners, whose compensation was fixed on the basis of weight, be paid according to
coal in the mine car rather than at a certain price per ton for coal screened after it
has been brought to the surface, and conditioning such payment on the presence of
no greater percentage of dirt or impurities than that ascertained as unavoidable by
the State Industrial Commission. Rail Coal Co. v. Ohio Industrial Comm’n, 236 U.S.
338 (1915). See also McLean v. Arkansas, 211 U.S. 539 (1909).
     109 Atkin v. Kansas, 191 U.S. 207 (1903).
     110 Sturges & Burn v. Beauchamp, 231 U.S. 320 (1913).
     111 St. Louis Consol. Coal Co. v. Illinois, 185 U.S. 203 (1902).
