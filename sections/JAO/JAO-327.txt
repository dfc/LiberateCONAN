laws of the State in which they reside.” 1763 Thus, one of the earli-
est equal protection decisions struck down the administration of a
facially lawful licensing ordinance that was being applied to dis-
criminate against Chinese.1764 In many subsequent cases, however,
the Court recognized a permissible state interest in distinguishing
between its citizens and aliens by restricting enjoyment of re-
sources and public employment to its own citizens.1765 But, in
Hirabayashi v. United States,1766 the Court announced that “[d]is-
tinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry” were “odi-
ous to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doc-
trine of equality.” And, in Korematsu v. United States,1767 classifications
based upon race and nationality were said to be suspect and sub-
ject to the “most rigid scrutiny.” These dicta resulted in a 1948 de-
cision that appeared to call into question the rationale of the “par-
ticular interest” doctrine under which earlier discrimination had been
justified. In the 1948 decision, the Court held void a statute bar-
ring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons “ineligible
to citizenship,” which in effect meant resident alien Japanese.1768

     1763 Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371 (1971). See also Yick Wo v. Hopkins,

118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 39 (1915); Takahashi v. Fish
& Game Comm’n, 334 U.S. 410, 420 (1948). Aliens, even unlawful aliens, are “per-
sons” to whom the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.
202, 210–16 (1982). The Federal Government may not discriminate invidiously against
aliens, Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976). However, because of the plenary
power delegated by the Constitution to the national government to deal with aliens
and naturalization, federal classifications are judged by less demanding standards
than are those of the states, and many classifications that would fail if attempted
by the states have been sustained because Congress has made them. Id. at 78–84;
Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977). Additionally, state discrimination against aliens
may fail because it imposes burdens not permitted or contemplated by Congress in
its regulations of admission and conditions of admission. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312
U.S. 52 (1941); Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1 (1982). Such state discrimination may
also violate treaty obligations and be void under the Supremacy Clause, Askura v.
City of Seattle, 265 U.S. 332 (1924), and some federal civil rights statutes, such as
42 U.S.C. § 1981, protect resident aliens as well as citizens. Graham v. Richardson,
403 U.S. at 376–80.

tion of property to aliens); Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197 (1923); Porterfield v.
Webb, 263 U.S. 225 (1923); Webb v. O’Brien, 263 U.S. 313 (1923); Frick v. Webb,

(1915) (barring public employment to aliens); Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, 274
U.S. 392 (1927) (prohibiting aliens from operating poolrooms). The Court struck down
a statute restricting the employment of aliens by private employers, however. Truax
