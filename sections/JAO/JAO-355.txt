case seems different in great degree from that in prior cases and
could in the future alter the results in other local government cases.
These cases were extended somewhat in Ball v. James,1879 a 5-to-4
decision that sustained a system in which voting eligibility was lim-
ited to landowners and votes were allocated to these voters on the
basis of the number of acres they owned. The entity was a water
reclamation district that stores and delivers water to 236,000 acres
of land in the state and subsidizes its water operations by selling
electricity to hundreds of thousands of consumers in a nearby met-
ropolitan area. The entity’s board of directors was elected through
a system in which the eligibility to vote was as described above.
The Court thought the entity was a specialized and limited form to
which its general franchise rulings did not apply.1880
    Finding that prevention of “raiding”—the practice whereby vot-
ers in sympathy with one party vote in another’s primary election
in order to distort that election’s results—is a legitimate and valid
state goal, as one element in the preservation of the integrity of
the electoral process, the Court sustained a state law requiring those
voters eligible at that time to register to enroll in the party of their
choice at least 30 days before the general election in order to be
eligible to vote in the party’s next primary election, 8 to 11 months
hence. The law did not impose a prohibition upon voting but merely
imposed a time deadline for enrollment, the Court held, and it was
because of the plaintiffs’ voluntary failure to register that they did
not meet the deadline.1881 But a law that prohibited a person from
voting in the primary election of a political party if he had voted in
the primary election of any other party within the preceding 23 months
was subjected to strict scrutiny and was voided, because it consti-
tuted a severe restriction upon a voter’s right to associate with the
party of his choice by requiring him to forgo participation in at least
one primary election in order to change parties.1882 A less restric-
tive “closed primary” system was also invalidated, the Court find-


    1879 451 U.S. 355 (1981).
    1880 The water district cases were distinguished in Quinn v. Millsap, 491 U.S.
95, 109 (1989), the Court holding that a “board of freeholders” appointed to recom-
mend a reorganization of local government had a mandate “far more encompassing”
than land use issues, as its recommendations “affect[ ] all citizens . . . regardless of
land ownership.”
