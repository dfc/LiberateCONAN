ate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or
directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was pending
or imminent.” 742
    (4) Confrontation and Cross-Examination. “In almost every set-
ting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due pro-
cess requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse
witnesses.” 743 Where the “evidence consists of the testimony of in-
dividuals whose memory might be faulty or who, in fact, might be
perjurers or persons motivated by malice, vindictiveness, intoler-
ance, prejudice, or jealously,” the individual’s right to show that it
is untrue depends on the rights of confrontation and cross-
examination. “This Court has been zealous to protect these rights
from erosion. It has spoken out not only in criminal cases, . . . but
also in all types of cases where administrative . . . actions were un-
der scrutiny.” 744
    (5) Discovery. The Court has never directly confronted this is-
sue, but in one case it did observe in dictum that “where govern-
mental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonable-
ness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to
prove the Government’s case must be disclosed to the individual so
that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue.” 745 Some fed-
eral agencies have adopted discovery rules modeled on the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Administrative Conference has rec-
ommended that all do so.746 There appear to be no cases, however,
holding they must, and there is some authority that they cannot
absent congressional authorization.747

     742 556 U.S. ___, No. 08–22, slip op. at 14. Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Jus-

tices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, dissented, asserting that “a ‘probability of bias’ can-
not be defined in any limited way,” “provides no guidance to judges and litigants
about when recusal will be constitutionally required,” and “will inevitably lead to
an increase in allegations that judges are biased, however groundless those charges
may be.” Slip. op. at 1 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The majority countered that “[t]he
facts now before us are extreme in any measure.” Slip op. at 17.
