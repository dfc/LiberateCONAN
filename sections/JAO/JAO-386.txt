     The Criminal Sentence.—A convicted defendant may not be
imprisoned solely because of his indigency. Williams v. Illinois 2033
held that it was a denial of equal protection for a state to extend
the term of imprisonment of a convicted defendant beyond the statu-
tory maximum provided because he was unable to pay the fine that
was also levied upon conviction. And Tate v. Short 2034 held that, in
situations in which no term of confinement is prescribed for an of-
fense but only a fine, the court may not jail persons who cannot
pay the fine, unless it is impossible to develop an alternative, such
as installment payments or fines scaled to ability to pay. Willful re-
fusal to pay may, however, be punished by confinement.
     Voting and Ballot Access.—Treatment of indigency in a civil
type of “fundamental interest” analysis came in Harper v. Virginia
Bd. of Elections,2035 in which it was held that “a State violates the
Equal Protection Clause . . . whenever it makes the affluence of the
voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifica-
tions have no relation to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or
any other tax.” The Court emphasized both the fundamental inter-
est in the right to vote and the suspect character of wealth classifi-
cations. “[W]e must remember that the interest of the State, when
it comes to voting, is limited to the power to fix qualifications. Wealth,
like race, creed, or color, is not germane to one’s ability to partici-
pate intelligently in the electoral process. Lines drawn on the basis
of wealth or property, like those of race . . . are traditionally disfa-
vored.” 2036
     The two factors—classification in effect along wealth lines and
adverse effect upon the exercise of the franchise—were tied to-
gether in Bullock v. Carter 2037 in which the setting of high filing
fees for certain offices was struck down under a standard that was
stricter than the traditional equal protection standard but appar-
ently less strict than the compelling state interest standard. The

     2033 399 U.S. 235 (1970).
     2034 401 U.S. 395 (1971). The Court has not yet treated a case in which the per-

missible sentence is “$30 or 30 days” or some similar form where either confine-
ment or a fine will satisfy the State’s penal policy.
     2035 383 U.S. 663, 666 (1966). The poll tax required to be paid as a condition of

voting was $1.50 annually. Justices Black, Harlan, and Stewart dissented. Id. at 670,
680.
     2036 383 U.S. at 668. The Court observed that “the right to vote is too precious,

too fundamental to be so burdened or conditioned.” Id. at 670.
