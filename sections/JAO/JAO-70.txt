Statutes forbidding or regulating the manufacture of oleomarga-
rine have been upheld,344 as have statutes ordering the destruction
of unsafe food 345 or confiscation of impure milk,346 notwithstanding
that, in the latter cases, such articles had a value for purposes other
than food. There also can be no question of the authority of the
state, in the interest of public health and welfare, to forbid the sale
of drugs by itinerant vendors 347 or the sale of spectacles by an es-
tablishment where a physician or optometrist is not in charge.348
Nor is it any longer possible to doubt the validity of state regula-
tions pertaining to the administration, sale, prescription, and use
of dangerous and habit-forming drugs.349
     Equally valid as police power regulations are laws forbidding
the sale of ice cream not containing a reasonable proportion of but-
ter fat,350 of condensed milk made from skimmed milk rather than
whole milk,351 or of food preservatives containing boric acid.352 Simi-
larly, a statute intended to prevent fraud and deception by prohib-
iting the sale of “filled milk” (milk to which has been added any fat
or oil other than a milk fat) is valid, at least where such milk has
the taste, consistency, and appearance of whole milk products. The
Court reasoned that filled milk is inferior to whole milk in its nu-
tritional content and cannot be served to children as a substitute
for whole milk without producing a dietary deficiency.353
    Even before the passage of the 21st Amendment, which granted
states the specific authority to regulate alcoholic beverages, the Su-
preme Court had found that the states have significant authority
in this regard.354 A state may declare that places where liquor is

not an issue, however, police power may be more limited. Thus, a statute forbidding
the sale of bedding made with shoddy materials, even if sterilized and therefore harm-
less to health, was held to be arbitrary and therefore invalid. Weaver v. Palmer Bros.
