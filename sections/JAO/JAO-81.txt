all.424 Thus, where airplanes are continually in and out of a state
during the course of a tax year, the entire fleet may be taxed by
the domicile state.425
     Conversely, a nondomiciliary state, although it may not tax prop-
erty belonging to a foreign corporation that has never come within
its borders, may levy a tax on movables that are regularly and ha-
bitually used and employed in that state. Thus, although the fact
that cars are loaded and reloaded at a refinery in a state outside
the owner’s domicile does not fix the situs of the entire fleet in that
state, the state may nevertheless tax the number of cars that on
the average are found to be present within its borders.426 But no
property of an interstate carrier can be taken into account unless
it can be seen in some plain and fairly intelligible way that it adds
to the value of the road and the rights exercised in the state.427 Or,
a state property tax on railroads, which is measured by gross earn-
ings apportioned to mileage, is constitutional unless it exceeds what


     424 Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U.S. 63 (1911). Ships operating wholly

on the waters within one state, however, are taxable there and not at the domicile
of the owners. Old Dominion Steamship Co. v. Virginia, 198 U.S. 299 (1905).
     425 Noting that an entire fleet of airplanes of an interstate carrier were “never

continuously without the [domiciliary] State during the whole tax year,” that such
airplanes also had their “home port” in the domiciliary state, and that the company
maintained its principal office therein, the Court sustained a personal property tax
applied by the domiciliary state to all the airplanes owned by the taxpayer. North-
west Airlines v. Minnesota, 322 U.S. 292, 294–97 (1944). No other state was deemed
able to accord the same protection and benefits as the taxing state in which the
taxpayer had both its domicile and its business situs. Union Transit Co. v. Ken-
tucky, 199 U.S. 194 (1905), which disallowed the taxing of tangibles located perma-
nently outside the domicile state, was held to be inapplicable. 322 U.S. at 295 (1944).
Instead, the case was said to be governed by New York ex rel. New York Cent. R.R.
v. Miller, 202 U.S. 584, 596 (1906). As to the problem of multiple taxation of such
airplanes, which had in fact been taxed proportionately by other states, the Court
declared that the “taxability of any part of this fleet by any other state, than Minne-
sota, in view of the taxability of the entire fleet by that state, is not now before us.”
Justice Jackson, in a concurring opinion, would treat Minnesota’s right to tax as
exclusively of any similar right elsewhere.
     426 Johnson Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 290 U.S. 158 (1933). Moreover, in assessing

that part of a railroad within its limits, a state need not treat it as an independent
line valued as if it was operated separately from the balance of the railroad. The
state may ascertain the value of the whole line as a single property and then deter-
mine the value of the part within on a mileage basis, unless there be special circum-
stances which distinguish between conditions in the several states. Pittsburgh C.C.
& St. L. Ry. v. Backus, 154 U.S. 421 (1894).
     427 Wallace v. Hines, 253 U.S. 66 (1920). For example, the ratio of track mileage

within the taxing state to total track mileage cannot be employed in evaluating that
portion of total railway property found in the state when the cost of the lines in the
taxing state was much less than in other states and the most valuable terminals of
the railroad were located in other states. See also Fargo v. Hart, 193 U.S. 490 (1904);
Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, 249 U.S. 275 (1919).
