    Efforts to Curb Busing and Other Desegregation Remedies.—
Especially during the 1970s, courts and Congress grappled with the
appropriateness of various remedies for de jure racial separation in
the public schools, both North and South. Busing of school children
created the greatest amount of controversy. Swann, of course, sanc-
tioned an order requiring fairly extensive busing, as did the more
recent Dayton and Columbus cases, but the earlier case cautioned
as well that courts must observe limits occasioned by the nature of
the educational process and the well-being of children,1649 and sub-
sequent cases declared the principle that the remedy must be no
more extensive than the violation found.1650 Congress enacted sev-
eral provisions of law, either permanent statutes or annual appro-
priations limits, that purport to restrict the power of federal courts
and administrative agencies to order or to require busing, but these,
either because of drafting infelicities or because of modifications re-
quired to obtain passage, have been largely ineffectual.1651 Stron-
ger proposals, for statutes or for constitutional amendments, were
introduced in Congress, but none passed both Houses.1652
    Of considerable importance to the possible validity of any sub-
stantial congressional restriction on judicial provision of remedies
for de jure segregation violations are two decisions contrastingly deal-

     1648 495 U.S. at 52. Similarly, the Court held in Spallone v. United States, 493

U.S. 265 (1990), that a district court had abused its discretion in imposing con-
tempt sanctions directly on members of a city council for refusing to vote to imple-
ment a consent decree designed to remedy housing discrimination. Instead, the court
should have proceeded first against the city alone, and should have proceeded against
individual council members only if the sanctions against the city failed to produce
compliance.
