er’s interest against the valid interest of the prison in maintaining
security and order in the institution, in protecting guards and pris-
oners against retaliation by other prisoners, and in reducing prison
tensions.
    The Court in Wolff held that the prison must afford the subject
of a disciplinary proceeding “advance written notice of the claimed
violation and a written statement of the factfindings as to the evi-
dence relied upon and the reasons for the action taken.” 1218 In ad-
dition, an “inmate facing disciplinary proceedings should be al-
lowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his
defense when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazard-
ous to institutional safety or correctional goals.” 1219 Confrontation
and cross-examination of adverse witnesses is not required inas-
much as these would no doubt threaten valid institutional inter-
ests. Ordinarily, an inmate has no right to representation by re-
tained or appointed counsel. Finally, only a partial right to an impartial
tribunal was recognized, the Court ruling that limitations imposed
on the discretion of a committee of prison officials sufficed for this
purpose.1220 Revocation of good time credits, the Court later ruled,
must be supported by “some evidence in the record,” but an amount
that “might be characterized as meager” is constitutionally suffi-
cient.1221
    Determination whether due process requires a hearing before a
prisoner is transferred from one institution to another requires a
close analysis of the applicable statutes and regulations as well as
a consideration of the particular harm suffered by the transferee.
On the one hand, the Court found that no hearing need be held
prior to the transfer from one prison to another prison in which
the conditions were substantially less favorable. Because the state
had not conferred any right to remain in the facility to which the
prisoner was first assigned, defeasible upon the commission of acts
for which transfer is a punishment, prison officials had unfettered
discretion to transfer any prisoner for any reason or for no reason


    1218 418 U.S. at 563.
    1219 418 U.S. at 566. However, the Court later ruled that the reasons for deny-
ing an inmate’s request to call witnesses need not be disclosed until the issue is
raised in court. Ponte v. Real, 471 U.S. 491 (1985).
    1220 418 U.S. at 561–72. The Court continues to adhere to its refusal to require

appointment of counsel. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 496–97 (1980), and id. at 497–
500 (Justice Powell concurring); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).
