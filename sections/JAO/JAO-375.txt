ther deters the exercise of that right or penalizes those who have
exercised it.1976 Any such classification is invalid “unless shown to
be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.” 1977
The constitutional right to travel has long been recognized,1978 but
it is only relatively recently that the strict standard of equal protec-
tion review has been applied to nullify durational residency require-
ments.
    Thus, in Shapiro v. Thompson,1979 durational residency require-
ments conditioning eligibility for welfare assistance on one year’s
residence in the state 1980 were voided. If the purpose of the require-
ments was to inhibit migration by needy persons into the state or
to bar the entry of those who came from low-paying states to higher-
paying ones in order to collect greater benefits, the Court said, the
purpose was impermissible.1981 If, on the other hand, the purpose
was to serve certain administrative and related governmental objec-
tives—the facilitation of the planning of budgets, the provision of
an objective test of residency, minimization of opportunity for fraud,
and encouragement of early entry of new residents into the labor
force—then the requirements were rationally related to the pur-
pose but they were not compelling enough to justify a classification

with Arlington County Bd. v. Richards, 434 U.S. 5 (1977). The same principle ap-
plies in the commerce clause cases, in which discrimination may run against in-
state as well as out-of-state concerns. Cf. Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 340
U.S. 349 (1951).
     1976 Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629–31, 638 (1969); Dunn v. Blumstein,

405 U.S. 330, 338–42 (1972); Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250
(1974); Jones v. Helms, 452 U.S. 412, 420–21 (1981). See also Oregon v. Mitchell,
400 U.S. 112, 236–39 (1970) (Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall), and id. at
285–92 (Justices Stewart and Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger).
     1977 Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634 (1969) (emphasis by Court); Gra-

ham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 375–76 (1971).
     1978 Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 (1868); Edwards v. California, 314

U.S. 160 (1941) (both cases in context of direct restrictions on travel). The source of
the right to travel and the reasons for reliance on the Equal Protection Clause are
questions puzzled over and unresolved by the Court. United States v. Guest, 383
U.S. 745, 758, 759 (1966), and id. at 763–64 (Justice Harlan concurring and dissent-
ing), id. at 777 n.3 (Justice Brennan concurring and dissenting); Shapiro v. Thomp-
son, 394 U.S. 618, 629–31 (1969), and id. at 671 (Justice Harlan dissenting); San
Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 31–32 (1973); Jones v. Helms, 452
U.S. 412, 417–19 (1981); Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 60 & n.6 (1982), and id. at
66–68 (Justice Brennan concurring), 78–81 (Justice O’Connor concurring).
     1979 394 U.S. 618 (1969).
     1980 The durational residency provision established by Congress for the District

of Columbia was also voided. 394 U.S. at 641–42.
     1981 394 U.S. at 627–33. Gaddis v. Wyman, 304 F. Supp. 717 (N.D.N.Y. 1969),

aff’d sub nom. Wyman v. Bowens, 397 U.S. 49 (1970), struck down a provision con-
strued so as to bar only persons who came into the state solely to obtain welfare
assistance.
