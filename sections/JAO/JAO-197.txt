follows a two-pronged analysis. First, the question is asked whether
the offense was induced by a government agent. Second, if the gov-
ernment has induced the defendant to break the law, “the prosecu-
tion must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was
disposed to commit the criminal act prior to first being approached
by Government agents.” 1054 If the defendant can be shown to have
been ready and willing to commit the crime whenever the opportu-
nity presented itself, the defense of entrapment is unavailing, no
matter the degree of inducement.1055 On the other hand, “[w]hen
the Government’s quest for conviction leads to the apprehension of
an otherwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely
would never run afoul of the law, the courts should intervene.” 1056
    Criminal Identification Process.—In criminal trials, the re-
liability and weight to be accorded an eyewitness identification
ordinarily are for the jury to decide, guided by instructions by
the trial judge and subject to judicial prerogatives under the
rules of evidence to exclude otherwise relevant evidence whose
probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial im-
pact or potential to mislead. At times, however, a defendant al-
leges an out-of-court identification in the presence of police is so
flawed that it is inadmissible as a matter of fundamental justice
under due process. 1057 These cases most commonly challenge
such police-arranged procedures as lineups, showups, photo-




available. Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 458–59 (1932) (separate opinion
of Justice Roberts); Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 383 (1958) (Justice Frank-
furter concurring); United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 441 (1973) (Justice Stew-
art dissenting); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 496–97 (1976) (Justice Bren-
nan dissenting).
     1054 Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 548–49 (1992). Here the Court held

that the government had failed to prove that the defendant was initially predis-
posed to purchase child pornography, even though he had become so predisposed
following solicitation through an undercover “sting” operation. For several years gov-
ernment agents had sent the defendant mailings soliciting his views on pornogra-
phy and child pornography, and urging him to obtain materials in order to fight
censorship and stand up for individual rights.
     1055 Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 451–52 (1932); Sherman v. United

States, 356 U.S. 369, 376–78 (1958); Masciale v. United States, 356 U.S. 386, 388
(1958); United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432–36 (1973); Hampton v. United
States, 425 U.S. 484, 488–489 (1976) (plurality opinion), and id. at 491 (Justices
Powell and Blackmun concurring).
     1056 Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 553–54 (1992).
     1057 A hearing by the trial judge on whether an eyewitness identification should

be barred from admission is not constitutionally required to be conducted out of the
presence of the jury. Watkins v. Sowders, 449 U.S. 341 (1981).
