grounds.” 1357 The lower court was directed to sift facts and weigh
circumstances on a case-by-case basis in making determina-
tions.1358
    It should be noted, however, that, without mentioning these cases,
the Court has interposed a potentially significant barrier to use of
the principle set out in them. In a 1976 decision, which it has since
expanded, it held that plaintiffs, seeking disallowal of governmen-
tal tax benefits accorded to institutions that allegedly discrimi-
nated against complainants and thus involved the government in
their actions, must show that revocation of the benefit would cause
the institutions to cease the complained-of conduct.1359
    “Person”.—In the case in which it was first called upon to in-
terpret this clause, the Court doubted whether “any action of a State
not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class,
or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the
purview of this provision.” 1360 Nonetheless, in deciding the Granger
Cases shortly thereafter, the Justices, as with the due process clause,
seemingly entertained no doubt that the railroad corporations were
entitled to invoke the protection of the clause.1361 Nine years later,
Chief Justice Waite announced from the bench that the Court would
not hear argument on the question whether the Equal Protection
Clause applied to corporations. “We are all of the opinion that it
does.” 1362 The word has been given the broadest possible meaning.

    1358  Unlike the situation in which private club discrimination is attacked di-
rectly, “the question of the existence of state action centers in the extent of the city’s
involvement in discriminatory actions by private agencies using public facili-
ties. . . .” Receipt of just any sort of benefit or service at all does not by the mere
provision—electricity, water, and police and fire protection, access generally to mu-
nicipal recreational facilities—constitute a showing of state involvement in discrimi-
nation and the lower court’s order was too broad because not predicated upon a proper
finding of state action. “If, however, the city or other governmental entity rations
otherwise freely accessible recreational facilities, the case for state action will natu-
rally be stronger than if the facilities are simply available to all comers without
condition or reservation.” 417 U.S. at 573–74. See also Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S.

decision made by the officials as to Medicaid payments, but to decisions made by
the nursing home in discharging and transferring patients).
