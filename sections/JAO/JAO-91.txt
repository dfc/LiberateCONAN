fact that another state has lawfully taxed identical income in the
hands of trustees operating in that state does not necessarily de-
stroy a domiciliary state’s right to tax the receipt of income by a
resident beneficiary.480
     Corporate Income Taxes: Foreign Corporations.—A tax based
on the income of a foreign corporation may be determined by allo-
cating to the state a proportion of the total,481 unless the income
attributed to the state is out of all appropriate proportion to the
business transacted in the state.482 Thus, a franchise tax on a for-
eign corporation may be measured by income, not just from busi-
ness within the state, but also on net income from interstate and
foreign business.483 Because the privilege granted by a state to a
foreign corporation of carrying on business supports a tax by that
state, it followed that a Wisconsin privilege dividend tax could be
applied to a Delaware corporation despite its having its principal
offices in New York, holding its meetings and voting its dividends
in New York, and drawing its dividend checks on New York bank
accounts. The tax could be imposed on the “privilege of declaring
and receiving dividends” out of income derived from property lo-
cated and business transacted in Wisconsin, equal to a specified per-
centage of such dividends, the corporation being required to deduct
the tax from dividends payable to resident and nonresident share-
holders.484

     480 Guaranty Trust Co. v. Virginia, 305 U.S. 19, 23 (1938). Likewise, even though

a nonresident does no business in a state, the state may tax the profits realized by
the nonresident upon his sale of a right appurtenant to membership in a stock ex-
change within its borders. New York ex rel. Whitney v. Graves, 299 U.S. 366 (1937).
     481 Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 254 U.S. 113 (1920); Bass, Ratcliff

& Gretton Ltd. v. Tax Comm’n, 266 U.S. 271 (1924). The Court has recently consid-
ered and expanded the ability of the states to use apportionment formulae to allo-
cate to each state for taxing purposes a fraction of the income earned by an inte-
grated business conducted in several states as well as abroad. Moorman Mfg. Co. v.
Bair, 437 U.S. 267 (1978); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U.S. 425
(1980); Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue, 447 U.S. 207 (1980). Exxon refused
to permit a unitary business to use separate accounting techniques that divided its
profits among its various functional departments to demonstrate that a state’s for-
mulary apportionment taxes extraterritorial income improperly. Moorman Mfg. Co.
v. Bair, 437 U.S. at 276–80, implied that a showing of actual multiple taxation was
a necessary predicate to a due process challenge but might not be sufficient.
     482 Evidence may be submitted that tends to show that a state has applied a

method that, although fair on its face, operates so as to reach profits that are in no
sense attributable to transactions within its jurisdiction. Hans Rees’ Sons v. North
Carolina, 283 U.S. 123 (1931).
     483 Matson Nav. Co. v. State Board, 297 U.S. 441 (1936).
     484 Wisconsin v. J.C. Penney Co., 311 U.S. 435, 448–49 (1940). Dissenting, Jus-

tice Roberts, along with Chief Justice Hughes and Justices McReynolds and Reed,
stressed the fact that the use and disbursement by the corporation at its home of-
fice of income derived from operations in many states does not depend on and can-
not be controlled by, any law of Wisconsin. The act of disbursing such income as
