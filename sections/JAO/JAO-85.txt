paid-in capital stock and surplus, less deductions for liabilities, not-
withstanding that such domestic corporation concentrates its execu-
tive, accounting, and other business offices in New York, and main-
tains in the domiciliary state only a required registered office at
which local claims are handled. Despite “the vicissitudes which the
so-called ‘jurisdiction-to-tax’ doctrine has encountered,” the presump-
tion persists that intangible property is taxable by the state of ori-
gin.450
     A property tax on the capital stock of a domestic company, how-
ever, the appraisal of which includes the value of coal mined in the
taxing state but located in another state awaiting sale, deprives the
corporation of its property without due process of law.451 Also void
for the same reason is a state tax on the franchise of a domestic
ferry company that includes in the valuation of the tax the worth
of a franchise granted to the company by another state.452
     Transfer (Inheritance, Estate, Gift) Taxes.—As a state has
authority to regulate transfer of property by wills or inheritance, it
may base its succession taxes upon either the transmission or re-
ceipt of property by will or by descent.453 But whatever may be the
justification of their power to levy such taxes, since 1905 the states
have consistently found themselves restricted by the rule in Union
Transit Co. v. Kentucky,454 which precludes imposition of transfer
taxes upon tangible which are permanently located or have an ac-
tual situs outside the state.
     In the case of intangibles, however, the Court has oscillated in
upholding, then rejecting, and again sustaining the levy by more
than one state of death taxes upon intangibles. Until 1930, trans-
fer taxes upon intangibles by either the domiciliary or the situs (but
done in another State and was there taxable. Moreover, this result follows whether
the tax is considered as one on property or on the franchise. Wheeling Steel Corp. v.
Fox, 298 U.S. 193 (1936). See also Memphis Gas Co. v. Beeler, 315 U.S. 649, 652
(1942).
     450 Newark Fire Ins. Co. v. State Board, 307 U.S. 313, 324 (1939). Although the

eight Justices affirming this tax were not in agreement as to the reasons to be as-
signed in justification of this result, the holding appears to be in line with the dic-
tum uttered by Chief Justice Stone in Curry v. McCanless, 307 U.S. 357, 368 (1939),
to the effect that the taxation of a corporation by a state where it does business,
measured by the value of the intangibles used in its business there, does not pre-
clude the state of incorporation from imposing a tax measured by all its intangibles.
     451 Delaware, L. & W.P.R.R. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U.S. 341 (1905).
     452 Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, 188 U.S. 385 (1903).
     453 Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U.S. 137, 140–41 (1925).
     454 199 U.S. 194 (1905) (property taxes). The rule was subsequently reiterated

in 1925 in Frick v. Pennsylvania, 268 U.S. 473 (1925). See also Treichler v. Wiscon-
sin, 338 U.S. 251 (1949); City Bank Farmers’ Trust Co. v. Schnader, 293 U.S. 112
(1934). In State Tax Comm’n v. Aldrich, 316 U.S. 174, 185 (1942), however, Justice
Jackson, in dissent, asserted that a reconsideration of this principle had become timely.
