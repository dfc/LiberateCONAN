making an equivalent price reduction, effects no discrimination. There
is a reasonable basis for concluding that destructive, deceptive com-
petition results from selective loss-leader selling whereas such abuses
do not attend issuance of trading stamps “across the board,” as a
discount for payment in cash.1559
    Administrative Discretion.—A municipal ordinance that vests
in supervisory authorities a naked and arbitrary power to grant or
withhold consent to the operation of laundries in wooden buildings,
without consideration of the circumstances of individual cases, con-
stitutes a denial of equal protection of the law when consent is with-
held from certain persons solely on the basis of nationality.1560 But
a city council may reserve to itself the power to make exceptions
from a ban on the operation of a dairy within the city,1561 or from
building line restrictions.1562 Written permission of the mayor or presi-
dent of the city council may be required before any person shall
move a building on a street.1563 The mayor may be empowered to
determine whether an applicant has a good character and reputa-
tion and is a suitable person to receive a license for the sale of ciga-
rettes.1564 In a later case,1565 the Court held that the unfettered dis-
cretion of river pilots to select their apprentices, which was almost
invariably exercised in favor of their relatives and friends, was not
a denial of equal protection to persons not selected despite the fact
that such apprenticeship was requisite for appointment as a pilot.
     Social Welfare.—The traditional “reasonable basis” standard
of equal protection adjudication developed in the main in cases in-
volving state regulation of business and industry. “The administra-
tion of public welfare assistance, by contrast, involves the most ba-
sic economic needs of impoverished human beings. We recognize the
dramatically real factual difference between the cited cases and this
one, but we can find no basis for applying a different constitutional
standard.” 1566 Thus, a formula for dispensing aid to dependent chil-
dren that imposed an upper limit on the amount one family could

     1566 Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970). Decisions respecting the

rights of the indigent in the criminal process and dicta in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U.S. 618, 627 (1969), had raised the prospect that because of the importance of “food,
shelter, and other necessities of life,” classifications with an adverse or perhaps se-
vere impact on the poor and needy would be subjected to a higher scrutiny. Dandridge
was a rejection of this approach, which was more fully elaborated in another con-
text in San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 18–29 (1973).
