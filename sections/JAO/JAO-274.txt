In succeeding years the clause has been invoked but sparingly to
invalidate state levies. In the field of property taxation, inequality
has been condemned only in two classes of cases: (1) discrimination
in assessments, and (2) discrimination against foreign corpora-
tions. In addition, there are a handful of cases invalidating, be-
cause of inequality, state laws imposing income, gross receipts, sales
and license taxes.
     Classification for Purpose of Taxation.—The power of the
state to classify for purposes of taxation is “of wide range and flex-
ibility.” 1468 A state may adjust its taxing system in such a way as


not allow them. All such regulations, and those of like character, so long as they
proceed within reasonable limits and general usage, are within the discretion of the
state legislature, or the people of the State in framing their Constitution.” 134 U.S.
