    Still, the Court continued to afford Congress signficant discre-
tion in alleviating racial discrimination, as more recent decisions
read broadly Congress’s power to make determinations that appear
to define the substantive content of constitutional violations.2130 For
instance, acting under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments, Congress has sought to reach state electoral practices that
“result” in diluting the voting power of minorities. In these cases,
however, the Court apparently requires that it be shown that elec-
toral procedures were created or maintained with a discriminatory
animus before they may be invalidated under the two Amend-
ments.2131
    As noted previously, the standard for review of expansion of con-
stitutional rights in the context of racial and ethnic discrimination
was established in Morgan as a deferential “rational basis” review.
Where remdial legislation regarding suspect classes are not at is-
sue, however, the Court seems to have taken a less deferential ap-
proach. In City of Boerne v. Flores,2132 the Court held that the Reli-
gious Freedom Restoration Act,2133 which expressly overturned the
Court’s narrowing of religious protections under Employment Divi-
sion v. Smith,2134 exceeded congressional power under § 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment. Although the Court allowed that Congress’s power
to legislate to deter or remedy constitutional violations may in-
clude prohibitions on conduct that is not itself unconstitutional, the
Court also held that there must be “a congruence and proportional-
ity” between the means adopted and the injury to be remedied.2135
Unlike the pervasive suppression of the African-American vote in
tive constitutional law what situations fall within the ambit of the clause, and what
state interests are ‘compelling.’ ” 400 U.S. at 296 (Justices Stewart and Blackmun
and Chief Justice Burger). In their view, Congress did not have that power and Mor-
gan did not confer it. But in voting to uphold the residency and absentee provision,
the Justices concluded that “Congress could rationally conclude that the imposition
of durational residency requirements unreasonably burdens and sanctions the privi-
lege of taking up residence in another State” without reaching an independent de-
termination of their own that the requirements did in fact have that effect. Id. at

     2131 The Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. 97–205, 96 Stat. 131,

amending 42 U.S.C. § 1973, were designed to overturn City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446
U.S. 55 (1980). A substantial change of direction in Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613
(1982), handed down coextensively with congressional enactment, seems to have brought
Congress and the Court into essential alignment, thereby avoiding a possible consti-
tutional conflict.
