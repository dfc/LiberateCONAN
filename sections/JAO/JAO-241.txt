district segregation.” 1283 The de jure/de facto distinction is thus well
established in school cases and is firmly grounded upon the “state
action” language of the Fourteenth Amendment.
     It has long been established that the actions of state officers
and agents are attributable to the state. Thus, application of a fed-
eral statute imposing a criminal penalty on a state judge who ex-
cluded African-Americans from jury duty was upheld as within con-
gressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment; the judge’s action
constituted state action even though state law did not authorize him
to select the jury in a racially discriminatory manner.1284 The fact
that the “state action” category is not limited to situations in which
state law affirmatively authorizes discriminatory action was made
clearer in Yick Wo v. Hopkins,1285 in which the Court found uncon-
stitutional state action in the discriminatory administration of an
ordinance that was fair and non-discriminatory on its face. Not even
the fact that the actions of the state agents are illegal under state
law makes the action unattributable to the state for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. “Misuse of power, possessed by virtue
of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed
with the authority of state law, is action taken ‘under color of ’ state
law.” 1286 When the denial of equal protection is not commanded by
law or by administrative regulation but is nonetheless accom-
plished through police enforcement of “custom” 1287 or through hor-
tatory admonitions by public officials to private parties to act in a

    1284  Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880). Similarly, the acts of a state gover-
nor are state actions, Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16–17 (1958); Sterling v. Constantin,
287 U.S. 378, 393 (1932), as are the acts of prosecuting attorneys, Mooney v. Holohan,
294 U.S. 103, 112, 113 (1935), state and local election officials, United States v. Clas-
sic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941), and law enforcement officials. Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U.S.
130 (1964); Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S.
91 (1945). One need not be an employee of the state to act “under color of ” state
law; mere participation in an act with state officers suffices. United States v. Price,
383 U.S. 787 (1966).
     1285 118 U.S. 356 (1886).
     1286 United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326 (1941). See also Screws v. United

States, 325 U.S. 91, 109 (1945) (citation omitted); Williams v. United States, 341
U.S. 97 (1951); United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 (1966). See also United States v.
Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 25 (1960). As Justice Brandeis noted in Iowa-Des Moines Nat’l
Bank v. Bennett, 284 U.S. 239, 246 (1931), “acts done ‘by virtue of public position
under a State government . . . and . . . in the name and for the State’ . . . are not
to be treated as if they were the acts of private individuals, although in doing them
the official acted contrary to an express command of the state law.” Note that, for
purposes of being amenable to suit in federal court, however, the immunity of the
states does not shield state officers who are alleged to be engaging in illegal or un-
constitutional action. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Cf. Screws v. United States,
325 U.S. at 147–48. .
