nitive award and plaintiff ’s actual or potential harm, and the legis-
lative sanctions provided for comparable misconduct.977 In addi-
tion, the “Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages
award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonpar-
ties . . . .” 978
    Statutes of Limitation.—A statute of limitations does not de-
prive one of property without due process of law, unless, in its ap-
plication to an existing right of action, it unreasonably limits the
opportunity to enforce the right by suit. By the same token, a state
may shorten an existing period of limitation, provided a reasonable
time is allowed for bringing an action after the passage of the stat-
ute and before the bar takes effect. What is a reasonable period,
however, is dependent on the nature of the right and particular cir-
cumstances.979
     Thus, where a receiver for property is appointed 13 years after
the disappearance of the owner and notice is made by publication,
it is not a violation of due process to bar actions relative to that
property after an interval of only one year after such appoint-
ment.980 When a state, by law, suddenly prohibits all actions to con-
test tax deeds which have been of record for two years unless they
are brought within six months after its passage, no unconstitu-
tional deprivation is effected.981 No less valid is a statute which pro-
vides that when a person has been in possession of wild lands un-
der a recorded deed continuously for 20 years and had paid taxes
thereon during the same, and the former owner in that interval pays
nothing, no action to recover such land shall be entertained unless
commenced within 20 years, or before the expiration of five years

sideration of conduct occurring in other states). But see TXO Corp. v. Alliance Re-
sources, 509 U.S. 443 (1993) (punitive damages of $10 million for slander of title
does not violate the Due Process Clause even though the jury awarded actual dam-
ages of only $19,000).
     977 BMW v. Gore, 517 U.S. at 574–75 (1996). The Court has suggested that awards

exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages would
be unlikely to pass scrutiny under due process, and that the greater the compensa-
tory damages, the less this ratio should be. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Camp-
bell, 538 U.S. at 424 (2003).
     978 Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 353 (2007) (punitive damages

award overturned because trial court had allowed jury to consider the effect of de-
fendant’s conduct on smokers who were not parties to the lawsuit).

tucky, 219 U.S. 140, 156 (1911). Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422,
437 (1982) (discussing discretion of states in erecting reasonable procedural require-
ments for triggering or foreclosing the right to an adjudication).
