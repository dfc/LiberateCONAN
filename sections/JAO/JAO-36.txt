union was deemed to have forfeited the right to claim exemption
from legislation protecting workers against discriminatory exclu-
sion.133
    Similarly, state laws outlawing closed shops were upheld in Lin-
coln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Com-
pany 134 and AFL v. American Sash & Door Co.135 When labor unions
attempted to invoke freedom of contract, the Court, speaking through
Justice Black, announced its refusal “to return . . . to . . . [a] due
process philosophy that has been deliberately discarded. . . . The
due process clause,” it maintained, does not “forbid a State to pass
laws clearly designed to safeguard the opportunity of nonunion work-
ers to get and hold jobs, free from discrimination against them be-
cause they are nonunion workers.” 136
    And, in UAW v. WERB,137 the Court upheld the Wisconsin Em-
ployment Peace Act, which had been used to proscribe unfair labor
practices by a union. In UAW, the union, acting after collective bar-
gaining negotiations had become deadlocked, had attempted to co-
erce an employer through calling frequent, irregular, and unan-
nounced union meetings during working hours, resulting in a slowdown
in production. “No one,” declared the Court, can question “the State’s
power to police coercion by . . . methods” that involve “consider-
able injury to property and intimidation of other employees by
threats.” 138

     133 Railway Mail Ass’n v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88, 94 (1945). Justice Frankfurter, con-

curring, declared that “the insistence by individuals of their private prejudices . . . ,
in relations like those now before us, ought not to have a higher constitutional sanc-
tion than the determination of a State to extend the area of nondiscrimination be-
yond that which the Constitution itself exacts.” Id. at 98.
     134 335 U.S. 525 (1949).
     135 335 U.S. 538 (1949).
     136 335 U.S. at 534, 537. In a lengthy opinion, in which he registered his concur-

rence with both decisions, Justice Frankfurter set forth extensive statistical data
calculated to prove that labor unions not only were possessed of considerable eco-
nomic power but by virtue of such power were no longer dependent on the closed
shop for survival. He would therefore leave to the legislatures the determination
“whether it is preferable in the public interest that trade unions should be sub-
jected to state intervention or left to the free play of social forces, whether experi-
ence has disclosed ‘union unfair labor practices,’ and if so, whether legislative correc-
tion is more appropriate than self-discipline and pressure of public opinion. . . .” Id.
at 538, 549–50.

(1949) (upholding state law forbidding agreements in restraint of trade as applied
to union ice peddlers picketing wholesale ice distributor to induce the latter not to
sell to nonunion peddlers). Other cases regulating picketing are treated under the
First Amendment topics, “Picketing and Boycotts by Labor Unions” and “Public Is-
sue Picketing and Parading,” supra.
