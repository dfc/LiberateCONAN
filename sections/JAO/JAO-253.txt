the private party would raise.1354 In either case, however, it must
be determined whether the governmental involvement is sufficient
to give rise to a constitutional remedy. In a suit against the private
party it must be determined whether he is so involved with the gov-
ernment as to be subject to constitutional restraints, while in a suit
against the government agency it must be determined whether the
government’s action “impermissibly fostered” the private conduct.
    Thus, in Norwood v. Harrison,1355 the Court struck down the
provision of free textbooks by a state to racially segregated private
schools (which were set up to avoid desegregated public schools),
even though the textbook program predated the establishment of
these schools. “[A]ny tangible state assistance, outside the general-
ized services government might provide to private segregated schools
in common with other schools, and with all citizens, is constitution-
ally prohibited if it has ‘a significant tendency to facilitate, rein-
force, and support private discrimination.’ . . . The constitutional
obligation of the State requires it to steer clear, not only of operat-
ing the old dual system of racially segregated schools, but also of
giving significant aid to institutions that practice racial or other in-
vidious discriminations.” 1356 And in a subsequent case, the Court
approved a lower court order that barred the city from permitting
exclusive temporary use of public recreational facilities by segre-
gated private schools because that interfered with an outstanding
order mandating public school desegregation. But it remanded for
further factfinding with respect to permitting nonexclusive use of
public recreational facilities and general government services by seg-
regated private schools so that the district court could determine
whether such uses “involve government so directly in the actions of
those users as to warrant court intervention on constitutional




     1354 For example, if a Court finds a relationship between the state and a discrimi-

nating private group (which may have rights of association protected by the First
Amendment), a remedy directed against the relationship might succeed, where a di-
rection to such group to eliminate such discrimination might not. See Moose Lodge
No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 179–80 (1972) (Justice Douglas dissenting); Gilmore
v. City of Montgomery, 417 U.S. 556, 575 (1974); Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455,
470 (1973). The right can be implicated as well by affirmative legislative action bar-
ring discrimination in private organizations. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160,
175–79 (1976).
