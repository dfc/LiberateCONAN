tion of dual attendance systems for students, but also the merging
into one system of faculty,1615 staff, and services, so that no school
could be marked as either a “black” or a “white” school.1616
     Implementation of School Desegregation.—In the after-
math of Green, the various Courts of Appeals held inadequate an
increasing number of school board plans based on “freedom of choice,”
on zoning which followed traditional residential patterns, or on some
combination of the two.1617 The Supreme Court’s next opportunity
to speak on the subject came when HEW sought to withdraw deseg-
regation plans it had submitted at court request and asked for a
postponement of a court-imposed deadline, which was reluctantly
granted by the Fifth Circuit. The Court unanimously reversed and
announced that “continued operation of segregated schools under a
standard of allowing ‘all deliberate speed’ for desegregation is no
longer constitutionally permissible. Under explicit holdings of this
Court the obligation of every school district is to terminate dual school
systems at once and to operate now and hereafter only unitary
schools.” 1618
     In the October 1970 Term the Court in Swann v. Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Board of Education 1619 undertook to elaborate the re-
quirements for achieving a unitary school system and delineating
the methods which could or must be used to achieve it, and at the
same time struck down state inhibitions on the process.1620 The opin-
ion in Swann emphasized that the goal since Brown was the dis-
mantling of an officially imposed dual school system. “Independent
of student assignment, where it is possible to identify a ‘white school’
or a ‘Negro school’ simply by reference to the racial composition of
tion.” Green and Raney v. Board of Educ. of Gould School Dist., 391 U.S. 443 (1968),
found “freedom of choice” plans inadequate, and Monroe v. Board of Comm’rs of City
of Jackson, 391 U.S. 450 (1968), found a “free transfer” plan inadequate.

gomery County Bd. of Educ., 395 U.S. 225 (1969) (upholding district court order re-
quiring assignment of faculty and staff on a ratio based on racial population of district).
