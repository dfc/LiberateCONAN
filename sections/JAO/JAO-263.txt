    Toward the end of the Warren Court, there emerged a trend to
treat classifications on the basis of nationality or alienage as sus-
pect,1408 to accord sex classifications a somewhat heightened tradi-
tional review while hinting that a higher standard might be appro-
priate if such classifications passed lenient review,1409 and to pass
on statutory and administrative treatments of illegitimates incon-
sistently.1410 Language in a number of opinions appeared to sug-
gest that poverty was a suspect condition, so that treating the poor
adversely might call for heightened equal protection review.1411
    However, in a major evaluation of equal protection analysis early
in this period, the Court reaffirmed a two-tier approach, determin-
ing that where the interests involved that did not occasion strict
scrutiny, the Court would decide the case on minimum rationality
standards. Justice Powell, writing for the Court in San Antonio School
Dist. v. Rodriguez,1412 decisively rejected the contention that a de
facto wealth classification, with an adverse impact on the poor, was
either a suspect classification or merited some scrutiny other than
the traditional basis,1413 a holding that has several times been strongly
reaffirmed by the Court.1414 But the Court’s rejection of some form
of intermediate scrutiny did not long survive.
   Without extended consideration of the issue of standards, the
Court more recently adopted an intermediate level of scrutiny, per-
haps one encompassing several degrees of intermediate scrutiny. Thus,
