liceman.” 763 Under this theory, a finding that a litigant had no “vested
property interest” in government employment,764 or that some form
of public assistance was “only” a privilege,765 meant that no proce-
dural due process was required before depriving a person of that
interest.766 The reasoning was that, if a government was under no
obligation to provide something, it could choose to provide it sub-
ject to whatever conditions or procedures it found appropriate.
     The conceptual underpinnings of this position, however, were
always in conflict with a line of cases holding that the government
could not require the diminution of constitutional rights as a condi-
tion for receiving benefits. This line of thought, referred to as the
“unconstitutional conditions” doctrine, held that, “even though a per-
son has no ‘right’ to a valuable government benefit and even though
the government may deny him the benefit for any number of rea-
sons, it may not do so on a basis that infringes his constitutionally
protected interests—especially, his interest in freedom of speech.” 767
Nonetheless, the two doctrines coexisted in an unstable relation-
ship until the 1960s, when the right-privilege distinction started to
be largely disregarded.768
     Concurrently with the virtual demise of the “right-privilege” dis-
tinction, there arose the “entitlement” doctrine, under which the Court
erected a barrier of procedural—but not substantive—protec-
tions 769 against erroneous governmental deprivation of something
it had within its discretion bestowed. Previously, the Court had lim-
ited due process protections to constitutional rights, traditional rights,
common law rights and “natural rights.” Now, under a new “positiv-
ist” approach, a protected property or liberty interest might be found
based on any positive governmental statute or governmental prac-

Constitutional Law, 81 HARV. L. REV. 1439 (1968). Much of the old fight had to do
with imposition of conditions on admitting corporations into a state. Cf. Western &
Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 451 U.S. 648, 656–68 (1981) (re-
