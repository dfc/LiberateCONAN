nondomiciliary) state, were with rare exceptions approved. Thus, in
Bullen v. Wisconsin,455 the domiciliary state of the creator of a trust
was held competent to levy an inheritance tax on an out-of-state
trust fund consisting of stocks, bonds, and notes, as the settlor re-
served the right to control disposition and to direct payment of in-
come for life. The Court reasoned that such reserved powers were
the equivalent to a fee in the property. It took cognizance of the
fact that the state in which these intangibles had their situs had
also taxed the trust.456
    On the other hand, the mere ownership by a foreign corpora-
tion of property in a nondomiciliary state was held insufficient to
support a tax by that state on the succession to shares of stock in
that corporation owned by a nonresident decedent.457 Also against
the trend was Blodgett v. Silberman,458 in which the Court de-
feated collection of a transfer tax by the domiciliary state by treat-
ing coins and bank notes deposited by a decedent in a safe deposit
box in another state as tangible property.459
    In the course of about two years following the Depression, the
Court handed down a group of four decisions that placed the stamp
of disapproval upon multiple transfer taxes and—by inference—
other multiple taxation of intangibles.460 The Court found that “prac-
tical considerations of wisdom, convenience and justice alike dic-
tate the desirability of a uniform rule confining the jurisdiction to
impose death transfer taxes as to intangibles to the State of the
[owner’s] domicile.” 461 Thus, the Court proceeded to deny the right
of nondomiciliary states to tax intangibles, rejecting jurisdictional
claims founded upon such bases as control, benefit, protection or
     455 240 U.S. 635, 631 (1916). A decision rendered in 1926 which is seemingly in

conflict was Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, 272 U.S. 567 (1926), in which
North Carolina was prevented from taxing the exercise of a power of appointment
through a will executed therein by a resident, when the property was a trust fund
in Massachusetts created by the will of a resident of the latter State. One of the
reasons assigned for this result was that by the law of Massachusetts the property
involved was treated as passing from the original donor to the appointee. However,
this holding was overruled in Graves v. Schmidlapp, 315 U.S. 657 (1942).
     456 Levy of an inheritance tax by a nondomiciliary State was also sustained on

similar grounds in Wheeler v. New York, 233 U.S. 434 (1914) wherein it was held
that the presence of a negotiable instrument was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon
the State seeking to tax its transfer.
     457 Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, 270 U.S. 69 (1926).
     458 277 U.S. 1 (1928).
     459 The Court conceded, however, that the domiciliary State could tax the trans-

fer of books and certificates of indebtedness found in that safe deposit box as well
as the decedent’s interest in a foreign partnership.
