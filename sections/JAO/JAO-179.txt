remedied,952 and may create courts and endow them with such ju-
risdiction as, in the judgment of their legislatures, seems appropri-
ate.953 Whether legislative action in such matters is deemed to be
wise or proves efficient, whether it works a particular hardship on
a particular litigant, or perpetuates or supplants ancient forms of
procedure, are issues that ordinarily do not implicate the Four-
teenth Amendment. The function of the Fourteenth Amendment is
negative rather than affirmative 954 and in no way obligates the states
to adopt specific measures of reform.955
    Commencement of Actions.—A state may impose certain con-
ditions on the right to institute litigation. Access to the courts has
been denied to persons instituting stockholders’ derivative actions
unless reasonable security for the costs and fees incurred by the
corporation is first tendered.956 But, foreclosure of all access to the
courts, through financial barriers and perhaps through other means
as well, is subject to federal constitutional scrutiny and must be
justified by reference to a state interest of suitable importance. Thus,
where a state has monopolized the avenues of settlement of dis-
putes between persons by prescribing judicial resolution, and where

character of the controversies which shall be heard in them and to deny access to
its courts is also subject to restrictions imposed by the Contract, Full Faith and Credit,
and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the Constitution. Angel v. Bullington, 330
U.S. 183 (1947).
     952 Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., 284 U.S. 151, 158 (1931); Iowa Central Ry. v.

Iowa, 160 U.S. 389, 393 (1896); Honeyman v. Hanan, 302 U.S. 375 (1937). See also
Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972).
     953 Cincinnati Street Ry. v. Snell, 193 U.S. 30, 36 (1904).
     954 Some recent decisions, however, have imposed some restrictions on state pro-

cedures that require substantial reorientation of process. While this is more gener-
ally true in the context of criminal cases, in which the appellate process and post-
conviction remedial process have been subject to considerable revision in the treatment
of indigents, some requirements have also been imposed in civil cases. Boddie v. Con-
necticut, 401 U.S. 371 (1971); Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74–79 (1972); Santosky
v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982). Review has, however, been restrained with regard
to details. See, e.g., Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. at 64–69.
     955 Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94, 112 (1921). Thus the Fourteenth Amend-

ment does not constrain the states to accept modern doctrines of equity, or adopt a
combined system of law and equity procedure, or dispense with all necessity for form
and method in pleading, or give untrammeled liberty to amend pleadings. Note that
the Supreme Court did once grant review to determine whether due process re-
quired the states to provide some form of post-conviction remedy to assert federal
constitutional violations, a review that was mooted when the state enacted such a
process. Case v. Nebraska, 381 U.S. 336 (1965). When a state, however, through its
legal system exerts a monopoly over the pacific settlement of private disputes, as
with the dissolution of marriage, due process may well impose affirmative obliga-
tions on that state. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 374–77 (1971).
     956 Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). Nor did the

retroactive application of this statutory requirement to actions pending at the time
of its adoption violate due process as long as no new liability for expenses incurred
before enactment was imposed thereby and the only effect thereof was to stay such
proceedings until the security was furnished.
