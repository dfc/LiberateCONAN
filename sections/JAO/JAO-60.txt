cians from hospitals maintained by it or its municipalities 269 and
may regulate the practice of dentistry by prescribing qualifications
that are reasonably necessary, requiring licenses, establishing a su-
pervisory administrative board, or prohibiting certain advertising
regardless of its truthfulness.270 The Court has sustained a law es-
tablishing as a qualification for obtaining or retaining a pharmacy
operating permit that one either be a registered pharmacist in good
standing or that the corporation or association have a majority of
its stock owned by registered pharmacists in good standing who were
actively and regularly employed in and responsible for the manage-
ment, supervision, and operation of such pharmacy.271
     Although statutes requiring pilots to be licensed 272 and setting
reasonable competency standards (e.g., that railroad engineers pass
color blindness tests) have been sustained,273 an act making it a
misdemeanor for a person to act as a railway passenger conductor
without having had two years’ experience as a freight conductor or
brakeman was invalidated as not rationally distinguishing be-
tween those competent and those not competent to serve as conduc-
tor.274 An act imposing license fees for operating employment agen-
cies and prohibiting them from sending applicants to an employer
who has not applied for labor does not deny due process of law.275
Also, a state law prohibiting operation of a “debt pooling” or a “debt
adjustment” business except as an incident to the legitimate prac-
tice of law is a valid exercise of legislative discretion.276

     271 North Dakota State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Snyder’s Drug Stores, 414 U.S. 156

(1973). In the course of the decision, the Court overruled Liggett Co. v. Baldridge,
278 U.S. 105 (1928), in which it had voided a law forbidding a corporation to own
any drug store, unless all its stockholders were licensed pharmacists, as applied to
a foreign corporation, all of whose stockholders were not pharmacists, which sought
to extend its business in the state by acquiring and operating therein two addi-
tional stores.

157–60 (1960), sustaining a New York law barring from office in a longshoremen’s
union persons convicted of a felony and not thereafter pardoned or granted a good
conduct certificate from a parole board.
     275 Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U.S. 340 (1916). With four Justices dissenting, the

Court in Adams v. Tanner, 244 U.S. 590 (1917), struck down a state law absolutely
prohibiting maintenance of private employment agencies. Commenting on the “con-
stitutional philosophy” thereof in Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron
& Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525, 535 (1949), Justice Black stated that Olsen v. Nebraska
ex rel. Western Reference and Bond Ass’n, 313 U.S. 236 (1941), “clearly undermined
Adams v. Tanner.”
