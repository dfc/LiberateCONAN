Amendment upon the ground that other property benefitted by the
improvement was not included.407
     On the other hand, when the benefit to be derived by a rail-
road from the construction of a highway will be largely offset by
the loss of local freight and passenger traffic, an assessment upon
such railroad violates due process,408 whereas any gains from in-
creased traffic reasonably expected to result from a road improve-
ment will suffice to sustain an assessment thereon.409 Also the fact
that the only use made of a lot abutting on a street improvement
is for a railway right of way does not make invalid, for lack of ben-
efits, an assessment thereon for grading, curbing, and paving.410 How-
ever, when a high and dry island was included within the boundar-
ies of a drainage district from which it could not be benefitted directly
or indirectly, a tax imposed on the island land by the district was
held to be a deprivation of property without due process of law.411
Finally, a state may levy an assessment for special benefits result-
ing from an improvement already made 412 and may validate an as-
sessment previously held void for want of authority.413

Jurisdiction to Tax
     Generally.—The operation of the Due Process Clause as a ju-
risdictional limitation on the taxing power of the states has been
an issue in a variety of different contexts, but most involve one of
two basic questions. First, is there a sufficient relationship be-
tween the state exercising taxing power and the object of the exer-
cise of that power? Second, is the degree of contact sufficient to jus-
tify the state’s imposition of a particular obligation? Illustrative of
the factual settings in which such issues arise are 1) determining
the scope of the business activity of a multi-jurisdictional entity that
is subject to a state’s taxing power; 2) application of wealth trans-
     407 Butters v. City of Oakland, 263 U.S. 162 (1923). It is also proper to impose a

special assessment for the preliminary expenses of an abandoned road improve-
ment, even though the assessment exceeds the amount of the benefit which the as-
sessors estimated the property would receive from the completed work. Missouri Pa-
cific R.R. v. Road District, 266 U.S. 187 (1924). See also Roberts v. Irrigation Dist.,
289 U.S. 71 (1933) (an assessment to pay the general indebtedness of an irrigation
district is valid, even though in excess of the benefits received). Likewise a levy upon
all lands within a drainage district of a tax of twenty-five cents per acre to defray
preliminary expenses does not unconstitutionally take the property of landowners
within that district who may not be benefitted by the completed drainage plans. Houck
v. Little River Dist., 239 U.S. 254 (1915).
