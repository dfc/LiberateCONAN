circumstances invalidate a plan.1922 The total population deviation
allowed in Abate was 11.9%; the Court refused, however, to extend
Abate to approve a total deviation of 78% resulting from an appor-
tionment plan providing for representation of each of New York City’s
five boroughs on the New York City Board of Estimate.1923
     Nine years after Reynolds v. Sims, the Court reexamined the
population equality requirement of the apportionment cases. Rely-
ing upon language in prior decisions that distinguished state legis-
lative apportionment from congressional districting as possibly jus-
tifying different standards of permissible deviations from equality,
the Court held that more flexibility is constitutionally permissible
with respect to the former than to the latter.1924 But it was in de-
termining how much greater flexibility was permissible that the Court
moved in new directions. First, applying the traditional standard
of rationality rather than the strict test of compelling necessity, the
Court held that a maximum 16.4% deviation from equality of popu-
lation was justified by the state’s policy of maintaining the integ-
rity of political subdivision lines, or according representation to sub-
divisions qua subdivisions, because the legislature was responsible
for much local legislation.1925 Second, just as the first case “demon-
strates, population deviations among districts may be sufficiently
     1922 Although the Court has used total population figures for purposes of com-

puting variations between districts, in Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73 (1966), it
approved the use of eligible voter population as the basis for apportioning in the
context of a state with a large transient military population, but with the caution
that such a basis would be permissible only so long as the results did not diverge
substantially from that obtained by using a total population base. Merely discount-
ing for military populations was disapproved in Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678, 691
(1964), but whether some more precise way of distinguishing between resident and
nonresident population would be constitutionally permissible is unclear. Kirkpatrick

n.9 (1970).
     1923 New York City Bd. of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688 (1989). Under the

plan each of the City’s five boroughs was represented on the board by its president
and each of these members had one vote; three citywide elected officials (the mayor,
the comptroller, and the president of the city council) were also placed on the board
and given two votes apiece (except that the mayor had no vote on the acceptance or
modification of his budget proposal). The Court also ruled that, when measuring popu-
lation deviation for a plan that mixes at-large and district representation, the at-
large representation must be taken into account. Id. at 699–701.
     1924 Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 320–25 (1973).
     1925 410 U.S. at 325–30. The Court indicated that a 16.4% deviation “may well

approach tolerable limits.” Id. at 329. Dissenting, Justices Brennan, Douglas, and
Marshall would have voided the plan; additionally, they thought the deviation was
actually 23.6% and that the plan discriminated geographically against one section
of the state, an issue not addressed by the Court. In Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1,
21–26 (1975), holding that a 20% variation in a court-developed plan was not justi-
fied, the Court indicated that such a deviation in a legislatively-produced plan would
be quite difficult to justify. See also Summers v. Cenarrusa, 413 U.S. 906 (1973) (va-
cating and remanding for further consideration the approval of a 19.4% deviation).
