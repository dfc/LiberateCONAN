discriminatory manner,1288 the action is state action. In addition,
when a state clothes a private party with official authority, that pri-
vate party may not engage in conduct forbidden the state.1289
    Beyond this are cases where a private individual discriminates,
and the question is whether a state has encouraged the effort or
has impermissibly aided it.1290 Of notable importance and a subject
of controversy since it was decided is Shelley v. Kraemer.1291 There,
property owners brought suit to enforce a racially restrictive cov-
enant, seeking to enjoin the sale of a home by white sellers to black
buyers. The covenants standing alone, Chief Justice Vinson said,
violated no rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. “So long
as the purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary
adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been
no action by the State and the provisions of the Amendment have
not been violated.” However, this situation is to be distinguished
from where “the purposes of the agreements were secured only by
judicial enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the
agreements.” 1292 Establishing that the precedents were to the ef-
fect that judicial action of state courts was state action, the Court
continued to find that judicial enforcement of these covenants was
forbidden. “The undisputed facts disclose that petitioners were will-
ing purchasers of properties upon which they desire to establish homes.
The owners of the properties were willing sellers; and contracts of
sale were accordingly consummated. . . .” 1293
    Arguments about the scope of Shelley began immediately. Did
the rationale mean that no private decision to discriminate could
      1288 Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267 (1963). No statute or ordinance man-

dated segregation at lunch counters but both the mayor and the chief of police had
recently issued statements announcing their intention to maintain the existing policy
of separation. Thus, the conviction of African-Americans for trespass because they
refused to leave a segregated lunch counter was voided.
      1289 Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 130 (1964). Guard at private entertainment

ground was also deputy sheriff; he could not execute the racially discriminatory poli-
cies of his private employer. See also Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97 (1951).
      1290 Examples already alluded to include Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267

(1963), in which certain officials had advocated continued segregation, Peterson v.
City of Greenville, 373 U.S. 244 (1963), in which there were segregation-requiring
ordinances and customs of separation, and Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. 153 (1964),
in which health regulations required separate restroom facilities in any establish-
ment serving both races.

      1293 “These are not cases . . . in which the States have merely abstained from

action, leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as they see
fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individu-
als the full coercive power of government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of
race or color, the enjoyment of property rights in premises which petitioners are will-
ing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors are willing to sell.” 334
