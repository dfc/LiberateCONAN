    (6) Decision on the Record. Although this issue arises princi-
pally in the administrative law area,748 it applies generally. “[T]he
decisionmaker’s conclusion . . . must rest solely on the legal rules
and evidence adduced at the hearing. To demonstrate compliance
with this elementary requirement, the decisionmaker should state
the reasons for his determination and indicate the evidence he re-
lied on, though his statement need not amount to a full opinion or
even formal findings of fact and conclusions of law.” 749
    (7) Counsel. In Goldberg v. Kelly, the Court held that a govern-
ment agency must permit a welfare recipient who has been denied
benefits to be represented by and assisted by counsel.750 In the years
since, the Court has struggled with whether civil litigants in court
and persons before agencies who could not afford retained counsel
should have counsel appointed and paid for, and the matter seems
far from settled. The Court has established a presumption that an
indigent does not have the right to appointed counsel unless his
“physical liberty” is threatened.751 Moreover, that an indigent may
have a right to appointed counsel in some civil proceedings where
incarceration is threatened does not mean that counsel must be made
available in all such cases. Rather, the Court focuses on the circum-
stances in individual cases, and may hold that provision of counsel
is not required if the state provides appropriate alternative safe-
guards.752

     748 The exclusiveness of the record is fundamental in administrative law. See

§ 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 556(e). However, one must
show not only that the agency used ex parte evidence but that he was prejudiced
thereby. Market Street R.R. v. Railroad Comm’n, 324 U.S. 548 (1945) (agency deci-
sion supported by evidence in record, its decision sustained, disregarding ex parte
evidence).
     749 Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 271 (1970) (citations omitted).
     750 397 U.S. 254, 270–71 (1970).
     751 Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18 (1981). The Court pur-

ported to draw this rule from Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973) (no per se
right to counsel in probation revocation proceedings). To introduce this presumption
into the balancing, however, appears to disregard the fact that the first factor of
Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), upon which the Court (and dissent) re-
lied, relates to the importance of the interest to the person claiming the right. Thus,
at least in this context, the value of the first Eldridge factor is diminished. The Court
noted, however, that the Mathews v. Eldridge standards were drafted in the context
of the generality of cases and were not intended for case-by-case application. Cf.
424 U.S. at 344 (1976).
     752 Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. ___, No. 10–10, slip op. (2011). The Turner Court

denied an indigent defendant appointed counsel in a civil contempt proceeding to
enforce a child support order, even though the defendant faced incarceration unless
he showed an inability to pay the arrearages. The party opposing the defendant in
the case was not the state, but rather the unrepresented custodial parent, nor was
the case unusually complex. A five-Justice majority, though denying a right to coun-
sel, nevertheless reversed the contempt order because it found that the procedures
followed remained inadequate.
