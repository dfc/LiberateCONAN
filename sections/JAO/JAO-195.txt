ever, a criminal statute may not impose a legal duty without no-
tice.1046
    The question of notice has also arisen in the context of “judge-
made” law. Although the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids retroactive
application of state and federal criminal laws, no such explicit re-
striction applies to the courts. Thus, when a state court abrogated
the common law rule that a victim must die within a “year and a
day” in order for homicide charges to be brought in Rogers v. Ten-
nessee,1047 the question arose whether such rule could be applied to
acts occurring before the court’s decision. The dissent argued vigor-
ously that unlike the traditional common law practice of adapting
legal principles to fit new fact situations, the court’s decision was
an outright reversal of existing law. Under this reasoning, the new
“law” could not be applied retrospectively. The majority held, how-
ever, that only those holdings which were “unexpected and indefen-
sible by reference to the law which had been express prior to the
conduct in issue” 1048 could not be applied retroactively. The rela-
tively archaic nature of “year and a day rule”, its abandonment by
most jurisdictions, and its inapplicability to modern times were all
cited as reasons that the defendant had fair warning of the pos-
sible abrogation of the common law rule.
    Entrapment.—Certain criminal offenses, because they are con-
sensual actions taken between and among willing parties, present
police with difficult investigative problems.1049 Thus, in order to de-
ter such criminal behavior, police agents may “encourage” persons
to engage in criminal behavior, such as selling narcotics or contra-

Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 395 (1979). Cf. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101–03
(1945) (plurality opinion). The Court have even done so when the statute did not
explicitly include such a mens rea requirement. E.g., Morissette v. United States,
342 U.S. 246 (1952).
     1046 See, e.g., Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957) (invalidating a munici-

pal code that made it a crime for anyone who had ever been convicted of a felony to
remain in the city for more than five days without registering.). In Lambert, the
Court emphasized that the act of being in the city was not itself blameworthy, hold-
ing that the failure to register was quite “unlike the commission of acts, or the fail-
ure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his
deed.” “Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no
proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with
due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is
written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the community.” Id. at

veillance, which is covered by the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amend-
ment, or informers may be used, which also has constitutional implications.
