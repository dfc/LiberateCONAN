for possessing pornography in the privacy of the home would raise
obvious First Amendment free speech and the Fourth Amendment
search and seizure issues. In this case, however, the material was
obscenity, unprotected by the First Amendment, and the police had
a valid search warrant, obviating Fourth Amendment concerns.641
Nonetheless, the Court based its decision upon a person’s protected
right to receive what information and ideas he wishes, which de-
rives from the “right to be free, except in very limited circum-
stances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one’s pri-
vacy,” 642 and from the failure of the state to either justify protecting
an individual from himself or to show empirical proof of such activ-
ity harming society.643
    The potential significance of Stanley was enormous, as any num-
ber of illegal personal activities, such as drug use or illegal sex acts,
could arguably be practiced in the privacy of one’s home with little
apparent effect on others. Stanley, however, was quickly restricted
to the particular facts of the case, namely possession of obscenity
in the home.644 In Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,645 which upheld
the government’s power to prevent the showing of obscene material
in an adult theater, the Court recognized that governmental inter-
ests in regulating private conduct could include the promotion of
individual character and public morality, and improvement of the
quality of life and “tone” of society. “It is argued that individual ‘free
will’ must govern, even in activities beyond the protection of the
First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees of privacy, and
that government cannot legitimately impede an individual’s desire
to see or acquire obscene plays, movies, and books. We do indeed
base our society on certain assumptions that people have the capac-
ity for free choice. Most exercises of individual free choice—those

was available for decision in favor of a broader resolution. 394 U.S. at 569–72. (Stew-
art, J., concurring).
     642 394 U.S. at 564–65.
     643 The rights noted by the Court were held superior to the interests Georgia

asserted to override them. That is, first, the state was held to have no authority to
protect an individual’s mind from the effects of obscenity, to promote the moral con-
tent of one’s thoughts. Second, the state’s assertion that exposure to obscenity may
lead to deviant sexual behavior was rejected on the basis of a lack of empirical sup-
port and, more important, on the basis that less intrusive deterrents were avail-
able. Thus, a right to be free of governmental regulation in this area was clearly
recognized.
