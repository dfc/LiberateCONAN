the company of “criminal street gang members” while in a public
place with “no apparent purpose,” failed to meet the “requirement
that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law en-
forcement.” 1040 The Court noted that “no apparent purpose” is in-
herently subjective because its application depends on whether some
purpose is “apparent” to the officer, who would presumably have the
discretion to ignore such apparent purposes as engaging in idle con-
versation or enjoying the evening air.1041 On the other hand, where
such a statute additionally required a finding that the defendant
was intent on causing inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, it was
upheld against facial challenge, at least as applied to a defendant
who was interfering with the ticketing of a car by the police.1042
    Statutes with vague standards may nonetheless be upheld if the
text of statute is interpreted by a court with sufficient clarity. Thus,
the civil commitment of persons of “such conditions of emotional in-
stability . . . as to render such person irresponsible for his conduct
with respect to sexual matters and thereby dangerous to other per-
sons” was upheld by the Court, based on a state court’s construc-
tion of the statute as only applying to persons who, by habitual course
of misconduct in sexual matters, have evidenced utter lack of power
to control their sexual impulses and are likely to inflict injury. The
underlying conditions—habitual course of misconduct in sexual mat-
ters and lack of power to control impulses and likelihood of attack
on others—were viewed as calling for evidence of past conduct point-
ing to probable consequences and as being as susceptible of proof
as many of the criteria constantly applied in criminal proceed-
ings.1043
    Conceptually related to the problem of definiteness in criminal
statutes is the problem of notice. Ordinarily, it can be said that ig-
norance of the law affords no excuse, or, in other instances, that
the nature of the subject matter or conduct may be sufficient to alert
one that there are laws which must be observed.1044 On occasion
the Court has even approved otherwise vague statutes because the
statute forbade only “willful” violations, which the Court construed
as requiring knowledge of the illegal nature of the proscribed con-

a novel application of a statute, not supported by Supreme Court or other “funda-
mentally similar” case precedent, so long as the court can find that, under the cir-
cumstance, “unlawfulness . . . is apparent” to the defendant. United States v. Lanier,
