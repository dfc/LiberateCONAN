ers of two thirds of the property abutting any street.327 Or, in another
case, it struck down an ordinance that permitted the establish-
ment of philanthropic homes for the aged in residential areas, but
only upon the written consent of the owners of two-thirds of the
property within 400 feet of the proposed facility.328 In a decision
falling chronologically between these two, however, the Court sus-
tained an ordinance that permitted property owners to waive a mu-
nicipal restriction prohibiting the construction of billboards.329
     In its most recent decision, the Court upheld a city charter pro-
vision permitting a petition process by which a citywide referen-
dum could be held on zoning changes and variances. The provision
required a 55% approval vote in the referendum to sustain the com-
mission’s decision, and the Court distinguished between delegating
such authority to a small group of affected landowners and the peo-
ple’s retention of the ultimate legislative power in themselves which
for convenience they had delegated to a legislative body.330
     Estates, Succession, Abandoned Property.—The Due Pro-
cess Clause does not prohibit a state from varying the rights of those
receiving benefits under intestate laws. Thus, the Court held that
the rights of an estate were not impaired where a New York Dece-
dent Estate Law granted a surviving spouse the right to take as in
intestacy, despite the fact that the spouse had waived any right to
her husband’s estate before the enactment of the law. Because rights
of succession to property are of statutory creation, the Court ex-
plained, New York could have conditioned any further exercise of
testamentary power upon the giving of right of election to the sur-
viving spouse regardless of any waiver, however formally ex-
ecuted.331
     Even after the creation of a testamentary trust, a state retains
the power to devise new and reasonable directions to the trustee to
meet new conditions arising during its administration. For in-
stance, the Great Depression resulted in the default of numerous
    327 Eubank v. City of Richmond, 226 U.S. 137 (1912).
    328 Washington ex rel. Seattle Title Trust Co. v. Roberge, 278 U.S. 116 (1928).
In a later case, the Court held that the zoning power may not be delegated to a
church. Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, 459 U.S. 116 (1982) (invalidating under the Estab-
lishment Clause a state law permitting any church to block issuance of a liquor li-
cense for a facility to be operated within 500 feet of the church).
    329 Thomas Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, 242 U.S. 526 (1917). The Court thought

the case different from Eubank, because in that case the ordinance established no
rule but gave the force of law to the decision of a narrow segment of the community,
whereas in Cusack the ordinance barred the erection of any billboards but permit-
ted the prohibition to be modified by the persons most affected. Id. at 531.
    330 City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, 426 U.S. 668 (1976). Such refer-

enda do, however, raise equal protection problems. See, e.g., Reitman v. Mulkey, 387
U.S. 369 (1967).
    331 Irving Trust Co. v. Day, 314 U.S. 556, 564 (1942).
