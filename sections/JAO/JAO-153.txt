remitted to other actions initiated by him 816 or an appeal may suf-
fice. Accordingly, a surety company, objecting to the entry of a judg-
ment against it on a supersedeas bond, without notice and an op-
portunity to be heard on the issue of liability, was not denied due
process where the state practice provided the opportunity for such
a hearing by an appeal from the judgment so entered. Nor could
the company found its claim of denial of due process upon the fact
that it lost this opportunity for a hearing by inadvertently pursu-
ing the wrong procedure in the state courts.817 On the other hand,
where a state appellate court reversed a trial court and entered a
final judgment for the defendant, a plaintiff who had never had an
opportunity to introduce evidence in rebuttal to certain testimony
which the trial court deemed immaterial but which the appellate
court considered material was held to have been deprived of his rights
without due process of law.818
    When Process Is Due.—The requirements of due process, as
has been noted, depend upon the nature of the interest at stake,
while the form of due process required is determined by the weight
of that interest balanced against the opposing interests.819 The cur-
rently prevailing standard is that formulated in Mathews v. Eldridge,820
which concerned termination of Social Security benefits. “Identifica-
tion of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consid-
eration of three distinct factors: first, the private interest that will
be affected by the official action; second, the risk of erroneous depri-
vation of such interest through the procedures used, and probable
value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and,
finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved
and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or sub-
stitute procedural requirements would entail.”

too severe an injury between the doing and the undoing, he may avoid the alterna-
tive means. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 647 (1972).

      819 “The extent to which procedural due process must be afforded the recipient

is influenced by the extent to which he may be ‘condemned to suffer grievous loss,’
. . . and depends upon whether the recipient’s interest in avoiding that loss out-
weighs the governmental interest in summary adjudication.” Goldberg v. Kelly, 397
U.S. 254, 262–63 (1970), (quoting Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341
U.S. 123, 168 (1951) (Justice Frankfurter concurring)). “The very nature of due pro-
cess negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imag-
inable situation.” Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 894–95
(1961).
