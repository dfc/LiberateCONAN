     Burden of Proof and Presumptions.—It is clearly within the
domain of the legislative branch of government to establish presump-
tions and rules respecting burden of proof in litigation.989 Nonethe-
less, the Due Process Clause does prevent the deprivation of lib-
erty or property upon application of a standard of proof too lax to
make reasonable assurance of accurate factfinding. Thus, “[t]he func-
tion of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due
Process Clause and in the realm of factfinding, is to ‘instruct the
factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he
should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particu-
lar type of adjudication.’ ” 990
     Applying the formula it has worked out for determining what
process is due in a particular situation,991 the Court has held that
a standard at least as stringent as clear and convincing evidence is
required in a civil proceeding to commit an individual involuntarily
to a state mental hospital for an indefinite period.992 Similarly, be-
cause the interest of parents in retaining custody of their children
is fundamental, the state may not terminate parental rights through
reliance on a standard of preponderance of the evidence—the proof
necessary to award money damages in an ordinary civil action—
but must prove that the parents are unfit by clear and convincing
evidence.993 Further, unfitness of a parent may not simply be pre-
sumed because of some purported assumption about general char-
acteristics, but must be established.994
     As long as a presumption is not unreasonable and is not conclu-
sive, it does not violate the Due Process Clause. Legislative fiat may
not take the place of fact in the determination of issues involving
life, liberty, or property, however, and a statute creating a presump-

273 U.S. 119, 124 (1927). Congress’s power to provide rules of evidence and stan-
dards of proof in the federal courts stems from its power to create such courts. Vance
v. Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252, 264–67 (1980); Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428
U.S. 1, 31 (1976). In the absence of congressional guidance, the Court has deter-
mined the evidentiary standard in certain statutory actions. Nishikawa v. Dulles,
356 U.S. 129 (1958); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966).
     990 Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 423 (1979) (quoting In re Winship, 397

U.S. 358, 370 (1970) (Justice Harlan concurring)).
     991 Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).
     992 Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979).
     993 Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982). Four Justices dissented, arguing

that considered as a whole the statutory scheme comported with due process. Id. at
770 (Justices Rehnquist, White, O’Connor, and Chief Justice Burger). Application of
the traditional preponderance of the evidence standard is permissible in paternity
actions. Rivera v. Minnich, 483 U.S. 574 (1987).
     994 Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) (presumption that unwed fathers are

unfit parents). But see Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110 (1989) (statutory pre-
sumption of legitimacy accorded to a child born to a married woman living with her
husband defeats the right of the child’s biological father to establish paternity.
