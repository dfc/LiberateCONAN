rived at the intermediate standard that many had thought it was
applying in any event.1810 The Court first examines the statutory
or administrative scheme to determine if the purpose or objective
is permissible and, if it is, whether it is important. Then, having
ascertained the actual motivation of the classification, the Court en-
gages in a balancing test to determine how well the classification
serves the end and whether a less discriminatory one would serve
that end without substantial loss to the government.1811
    Some sex distinctions were seen to be based solely upon “old
notions,” no longer valid if ever they were, about the respective roles
of the sexes in society, and those distinctions failed to survive even
traditional scrutiny. Thus, a state law defining the age of majority
as 18 for females and 21 for males, entitling the male child to sup-
port by his divorced father for three years longer than the female
child, was deemed merely irrational, grounded as it was in the as-
sumption of the male as the breadwinner, needing longer to pre-
pare, and the female as suited for wife and mother.1812 Similarly, a
state jury system that in effect excluded almost all women was deemed


classification, finding that inappropriate while the Equal Rights Amendment was
pending. Id. at 691 (Justices Powell and Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger). Jus-
tice Stewart found the statute void under traditional scrutiny and Justice Rehnquist
dissented. Id. at 691. In Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724
n.9 (1982), Justice O’Connor for the Court expressly reserved decision whether a
classification that survived intermediate scrutiny would be subject to strict scrutiny.
     1810 Although their concurrences in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 210, 211 (1976),

indicate some reticence about express reliance on intermediate scrutiny, Justices Pow-
ell and Stevens have since joined or written opinions stating the test and applying
it. E.g., Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 388 (1979) (Justice Powell writing the
opinion of the Court); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 359 (1979) (Justice Powell
concurring); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 217 (1977) (Justice Stevens concur-
ring); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. at 401 (Justice Stevens dissenting). Chief Jus-
tice Burger and Justice Rehnquist have not clearly stated a test, although their def-
erence to legislative judgment approaches the traditional scrutiny test. But see Califano
v. Westcott, 443 U.S. at 93 (joining Court on substantive decision). And cf. Missis-
sippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 734–35 (1982) (Justice Blackmun
dissenting).
     1811 The test is thus the same as is applied to illegitimacy classifications, al-

though with apparently more rigor when sex is involved.
     1812 Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975). See also Stanton v. Stanton, 429 U.S.

501 (1977). Assumptions about the traditional roles of the sexes afford no basis for
support of classifications under the intermediate scrutiny standard. E.g., Orr v. Orr,
440 U.S. 268, 279–80 (1979); Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347, 355 (1979); Kirchberg
v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455 (1981). Justice Stevens in particular has been concerned
whether legislative classifications by sex simply reflect traditional ways of thinking
or are the result of a reasoned attempt to reach some neutral goal, e.g., Califano v.
Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 222–23 (1978) (concurring), and he will sustain some other-
wise impermissible distinctions if he finds the legislative reasoning to approximate
the latter approach. Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 401 (1979) (dissenting).
