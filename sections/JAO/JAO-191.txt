     Clarity in Criminal Statutes: The Void-for-Vagueness Doc-
trine.—Criminal statutes that lack sufficient definiteness or speci-
ficity are commonly held “void for vagueness.” 1028 Such legislation
“may run afoul of the Due Process Clause because it fails to give
adequate guidance to those who would be law-abiding, to advise de-
fendants of the nature of the offense with which they are charged,
or to guide courts in trying those who are accused.” 1029 “Men of com-
mon intelligence cannot be required to guess at the meaning of [an]
enactment.” 1030
     For instance, the Court voided for vagueness a criminal statute
providing that a person was a “gangster” and subject to fine or im-
prisonment if he was without lawful employment, had been either
convicted at least three times for disorderly conduct or had been
convicted of any other crime, and was “known to be a member of a
gang of two or more persons.” The Court observed that neither com-
mon law nor the statute gave the words “gang” or “gangster” defi-
nite meaning, that the enforcing agencies and courts were free to

     1029 Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S. 95, 97 (1948). “The vagueness may be from uncer-

tainty in regard to persons within the scope of the act . . . or in regard to the appli-
cable tests to ascertain guilt.” Id. at 97. “Vague laws offend several important val-
ues. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful
conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws
may trap the innocent by not providing fair warnings. Second, if arbitrary and dis-
criminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards
for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters
to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,
with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.” Grayned
v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108–09 (1972), quoted in Village of Hoffman Es-
tates v. The Flipside, 455 U.S. 489, 498 (1982).
     1030 Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 515–16 (1948). “The vagueness may be

from uncertainty in regard to persons within the scope of the act . . . or in regard
to the applicable test to ascertain guilt.” Id. Cf. Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104,
110 (1972). Thus, a state statute imposing severe, cumulative punishments upon con-
tractors with the state who pay their workers less than the “current rate of per
diem wages in the locality where the work is performed” was held to be “so vague
that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ
as to its application.” Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385 (1926). Simi-
larly, a statute which allowed jurors to require an acquitted defendant to pay the
costs of the prosecution, elucidated only by the judge’s instruction to the jury that
the defendant should only have to pay the costs if it thought him guilty of “some
misconduct” though innocent of the crime with which he was charged, was found to
fall short of the requirements of due process. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399
(1966).
