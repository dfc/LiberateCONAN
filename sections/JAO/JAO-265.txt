tions are neither suspect nor entitled to intermediate scrutiny.1418
Although the Court resists the creation of new suspect or “quasi-
suspect” classifications, it may still, on occasion, apply the Royster
Guano rather than the Lindsley standard of rationality.1419
    The other phase of active review of classifications holds that when
certain fundamental liberties and interests are involved, govern-
ment classifications which adversely affect them must be justified
by a showing of a compelling interest necessitating the classifica-
tion and by a showing that the distinctions are required to further
the governmental purpose. The effect of applying the test, as in the
other branch of active review, is to deny to legislative judgments
the deference usually accorded them and to dispense with the gen-
eral presumption of constitutionality usually given state classifica-
tions.1420
    It is thought 1421 that the “fundamental right” theory had its ori-
gins in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,1422 in which the
Court subjected to “strict scrutiny” a state statute providing for com-
pulsory sterilization of habitual criminals, such scrutiny being thought
necessary because the law affected “one of the basic civil rights.” In
the apportionment decisions, Chief Justice Warren observed that,
“since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired
manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any
alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be care-
fully and meticulously scrutinized.” 1423 A stiffening of the tradi-
tional test could be noted in the opinion of the Court striking down
certain restrictions on voting eligibility 1424 and the phrase “compel-
ling state interest” was used several times in Justice Brennan’s opin-
ion in Shapiro v. Thompson.1425 Thereafter, the phrase was used in

a more exacting standard of judicial review than is normally accorded economic and
social legislation”).
