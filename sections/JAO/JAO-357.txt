     Access to the Ballot.—The Equal Protection Clause applies to
state specification of qualifications for elective and appointive of-
fice. Although one may “have no right” to be elected or appointed
to an office, all persons “do have a federal constitutional right to be
considered for public service without the burden of invidiously dis-
criminatory disqualification. The State may not deny to some the
privilege of holding public office that it extends to others on the ba-
sis of distinctions that violate federal constitutional guaran-
tees.” 1887 In Bullock v. Carter,1888 the Court used a somewhat modi-
fied form of the strict test in passing upon a filing fee system for
primary election candidates that imposed the cost of the election
wholly on the candidates and that made no alternative provision
for candidates unable to pay the fees; the reason for application of
the standard, however, was that the fee system deprived some classes
of voters of the opportunity to vote for certain candidates and it
worked its classifications along lines of wealth. The system itself
was voided because it was not reasonably connected with the state’s
interest in regulating the ballot and did not serve that interest and
because the cost of the election could be met out of the state trea-
sury, thus avoiding the discrimination.1889
    Recognizing the state interest in maintaining a ballot of reason-
able length in order to promote rational voter choice, the Court ob-
served nonetheless that filing fees alone do not test the genuine-
ness of a candidacy or the extent of voter support for an aspirant.
Therefore, effectuation of the legitimate state interest must be achieved
by means that do not unfairly or unnecessarily burden the party’s
or the candidate’s “important interest in the continued availability
of political opportunity. The interests involved are not merely those
of parties or individual candidates; the voters can assert their pref-
erences only through candidates or parties or both and it is this
broad interest that must be weighed in the balance. . . . [T]he pro-
cess of qualifying candidates for a place on the ballot may not con-
stitutionally be measured solely in dollars.” 1890 In the absence of
