mental principle of liberty and justice which inheres in the very
idea of a free government and is the inalienable right of a citizen
of such government.” 1022
     This inquiry contains a historical component, as “recent cases
. . . have proceeded upon the valid assumption that state criminal
processes are not imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual sys-
tems bearing virtually every characteristic of the common-law sys-
tem that has been developing contemporaneously in England and
in this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of sys-
tem a particular procedure is fundamental—whether, that is, a pro-
cedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered lib-
erty. . . . [Therefore, the limitations imposed by the Court on the
states are] not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every crimi-
nal system that might be imagined but [are] fundamental in the
context of the criminal processes maintained by the American
States.” 1023

The Elements of Due Process
    Initiation of the Prosecution.—Indictment by a grand jury
is not a requirement of due process; a state may proceed instead
by information.1024 Due process does require that, whatever the pro-
cedure, a defendant must be given adequate notice of the offense
charged against him and for which he is to be tried,1025 even aside
from the notice requirements of the Sixth Amendment.1026 Where,

      1022 Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 106 (1908). The question is phrased as

whether a claimed right is “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” whether it
partakes “of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty,” Palko v. Connecticut,
302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937), or whether it “offend[s] those canons of decency and fair-
ness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples even toward
those charged with the most heinous offenses,” Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165,
169 (1952).
      1023 Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149–50 n.14 (1968).
      1024 Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884). The Court has also rejected an

argument that due process requires that criminal prosecutions go forward only on a
showing of probable cause. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266 (1994) (holding that there
is no civil rights action based on the Fourteenth Amendment for arrest and imposi-
tion of bond without probable cause).
      1025 Smith v. O’Grady, 312 U.S. 329 (1941) (guilty plea of layman unrepresented

by counsel to what prosecution represented as a charge of simple burglary but which
was in fact a charge of “burglary with explosives” carrying a much lengthier sen-
tence voided). See also Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196 (1948) (affirmance by appel-
late court of conviction and sentence on ground that evidence showed defendant guilty
under a section of the statute not charged violated due process); In re Ruffalo, 390
U.S. 544 (1968) (disbarment in proceeding on charge which was not made until af-
ter lawyer had testified denied due process); Rabe v. Washington, 405 U.S. 313 (1972)
(affirmance of obscenity conviction because of the context in which a movie was shown—
grounds neither covered in the statute nor listed in the charge—was invalid).
