teachers and staff, the quality of school buildings and equipment,
or the organization of sports activities, a prima facie case of viola-
tion of substantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protec-
tion Clause is shown.” 1621 Although “the existence of some small
number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district
is not in and of itself the mark of a system that still practices seg-
regation by law,” any such situation must be closely scrutinized by
the lower courts, and school officials have a heavy burden to prove
that the situation is not the result of state-fostered segregation. Any
desegregation plan that contemplates such a situation must before
a court accepts it be shown not to be affected by present or past
discriminatory action on the part of state and local officials.1622 When
a federal court has to develop a remedial desegregation plan, it must
start with an appreciation of the mathematics of the racial compo-
sition of the school district population; its plan may rely to some
extent on mathematical ratios but it should exercise care that this
use is only a starting point.1623
    Because current attendance patterns may be attributable to past
discriminatory actions in site selection and location of school build-
ings, the Court in Swann determined that it is permissible, and may
be required, to resort to altering of attendance boundaries and group-
ing or pairing schools in noncontiguous fashion in order to promote
desegregation and undo past official action; in this remedial pro-
cess, conscious assignment of students and drawing of boundaries
on the basis of race is permissible.1624 Transportation of students—
busing—is a permissible tool of educational and desegregation policy,
inasmuch as a neighborhood attendance policy may be inadequate
due to past discrimination. The soundness of any busing plan must
be weighed on the basis of many factors, including the age of the
students; when the time or distance of travel is so great as to risk
the health of children or significantly impinge on the educational
process, the weight shifts.1625 Finally, the Court indicated, once a
unitary system has been established, no affirmative obligation rests
on school boards to adjust attendance year by year to reflect changes
in composition of neighborhoods so long as the change is solely at-
tributable to private action.1626

(1976), the Court held that after a school board has complied with a judicially-
imposed desegregation plan in student assignments and thus undone the existing
segregation, it is beyond the district court’s power to order it subsequently to imple-
