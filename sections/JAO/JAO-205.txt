     In United States v. Agurs,1092 the Court summarized and some-
what expanded the prosecutor’s obligation to disclose to the de-
fense exculpatory evidence in his possession, even in the absence of
a request, or upon a general request, by defendant. First, as noted,
if the prosecutor knew or should have known that testimony given
to the trial was perjured, the conviction must be set aside if there
is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have af-
fected the judgment of the jury.1093 Second, as established in Brady,
if the defense specifically requested certain evidence and the pros-
ecutor withheld it,1094 the conviction must be set aside if the sup-
pressed evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial.1095
Third (the new law created in Agurs), if the defense did not make
a request at all, or simply asked for “all Brady material” or for “any-
thing exculpatory,” a duty resides in the prosecution to reveal to
the defense obviously exculpatory evidence. Under this third prong,
if the prosecutor did not reveal the relevant information, reversal
of a conviction may be required, but only if the undisclosed evi-
dence creates a reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.1096
    This tripartite formulation, however, suffered from two appar-
ent defects. First, it added a new level of complexity to a Brady
inquiry by requiring a reviewing court to establish the appropriate

where prosecutor’s failure to disclose the result of a witness’ polygraph test would
not have affected the outcome of the case). The beginning in Brady toward a gen-
eral requirement of criminal discovery was not carried forward. See the division of
opinion in Giles v. Maryland, 386 U.S. 66 (1967).
     In Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–1114, slip op. at 23, 27 (2009), the Court
emphasized the distinction between the materiality of the evidence with respect to
guilt and the materiality of the evidence with respect to punishment, and concluded
that, although the evidence that had been suppressed was not material to the defen-
dant’s conviction, the lower courts had erred in failing to assess its effect with re-
spect to the defendant’s capital sentence.
     1092 427 U.S. 97 (1976).
     1093 427 U.S. at 103–04. This situation is the Mooney v. Holohan-type of case.
     1094 A statement by the prosecution that it will “open its files” to the defendant

appears to relieve the defendant of his obligation to request such materials. See Strickler
v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 283–84 (1999); Banks v. Dretke, 540 U.S. 668, 693 (2004).
     1095 427 U.S. at 104–06. This the Brady situation.
     1096 427 U.S. at 106–14. This was the Agurs fact situation. Similarly, there is

no obligation that law enforcement officials preserve breath samples that have been
used in a breath-analysis test; to meet the Agurs materiality standard, “evidence
must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was
destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain
comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.” California v. Trombetta,
467 U.S. 479, 489 (1984). See also Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988) (negli-
gent failure to refrigerate and otherwise preserve potentially exculpatory physical
evidence from sexual assault kit does not violate a defendant’s due process rights
absent bad faith on the part of the police); Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S. 544 (2004)
(per curiam) (the routine destruction of a bag of cocaine 11 years after an arrest,
the defendant having fled prosecution during the intervening years, does not violate
due process).
