principle, the Court in Miller v. Pate 1087 overturned a conviction
obtained after the prosecution had represented to the jury that a
pair of men’s shorts found near the scene of a sex attack belonged
to the defendant and that they were stained with blood; the defen-
dant showed in a habeas corpus proceeding that no evidence con-
nected him with the shorts and furthermore that the shorts were
not in fact bloodstained, and that the prosecution had known these
facts.
     This line of reasoning has even resulted in the disclosure to the
defense of information not relied upon by the prosecution during
trial.1088 In Brady v. Maryland,1089 the Court held “that the suppres-
sion by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon
request violates due process where the evidence is material either
to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith
of the prosecution.” In that case, the prosecution had suppressed
an extrajudicial confession of defendant’s accomplice that he had
actually committed the murder.1090 “The heart of the holding in Brady
is the prosecution’s suppression of evidence, in the face of a de-
fense production request, where the evidence is favorable to the ac-
cused and is material either to guilt or to punishment. Important,
then, are (a) suppression by the prosecution after a request by the
defense, (b) the evidence’s favorable character for the defense, and
(c) the materiality of the evidence.” 1091

    1088  The Constitution does not require the government, prior to entering into a
binding plea agreement with a criminal defendant, to disclose impeachment informa-
tion relating to any informants or other witnesses against the defendant. United
States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622 (2002). Nor has it been settled whether inconsistent
prosecutorial theories in separate cases can be the basis for a due process chal-
lenge. Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S. 175 (2005) (Court remanded case to determine
whether death sentence was based on defendant’s role as shooter because subse-
quent prosecution against an accomplice proceeded on the theory that, based on new
evidence, the accomplice had done the shooting).
     1089 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). In Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), in

the exercise of its supervisory power over the federal courts, the Court held that the
defense was entitled to obtain, for impeachment purposes, statements which had
been made to government agents by government witnesses during the investigatory
stage. Cf. Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 257–58 (1961). A subsequent stat-
ute modified but largely codified the decision and was upheld by the Court. Palermo
v. United States, 360 U.S. 343 (1959), sustaining 18 U.S.C. § 3500.
     1090 Although the state court in Brady had allowed a partial retrial so that the

accomplice’s confession could be considered in the jury’s determination of whether
to impose capital punishment, it had declined to order a retrial of the guilt phase of
the trial. The defendant’s appeal of this latter decision was rejected, as the issue, as
the Court saw it, was whether the state court could have excluded the defendant’s
confessed participation in the crime on evidentiary grounds, as the defendant had
confessed to facts sufficient to establish grounds for the crime charged.

because the evidence withheld was not material and not exculpatory). See also Wood
