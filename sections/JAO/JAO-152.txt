precede such action, becomes a matter of greater urgency and must
be determined by evaluating the various factors discussed below.811
     One such factor is whether agency action is subject to later ju-
dicial scrutiny.812 In one of the initial decisions construing the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Court upheld the au-
thority of the Secretary of the Treasury, acting pursuant to statute,
to obtain money from a collector of customs alleged to be in ar-
rears. The Treasury simply issued a distress warrant and seized
the collector’s property, affording him no opportunity for a hearing,
and requiring him to sue for recovery of his property. While acknowl-
edging that history and settled practice required proceedings in which
pleas, answers, and trials were requisite before property could be
taken, the Court observed that the distress collection of debts due
the crown had been the exception to the rule in England and was
of long usage in the United States, and was thus sustainable.813
     In more modern times, the Court upheld a procedure under which
a state banking superintendent, after having taken over a closed
bank and issuing notices to stockholders of their assessment, could
issue execution for the amounts due, subject to the right of each
stockholder to contest his liability for such an assessment by an
affidavit of illegality. The fact that the execution was issued in the
first instance by a governmental officer and not from a court, fol-
lowed by personal notice and a right to take the case into court,
was seen as unobjectionable.814
    It is a violation of due process for a state to enforce a judgment
against a party to a proceeding without having given him an oppor-
tunity to be heard sometime before final judgment is entered.815 With
regard to the presentation of every available defense, however, the
requirements of due process do not necessarily entail affording an
opportunity to do so before entry of judgment. The person may be

facts are in issue, and adjudication, at which adjudicative facts are at issue, requir-
ing a hearing in latter proceedings but not in the former). See Londoner v. City of
Denver, 210 U.S. 373 (1908).
     812 “It is not an indispensable requirement of due process that every procedure

affecting the ownership or disposition of property be exclusively by judicial proceed-
ing. Statutory proceedings affecting property rights which, by later resort to the courts,
secures to adverse parties an opportunity to be heard, suitable to the occasion, do
not deny due process.” Anderson Nat’l Bank v. Luckett, 321 U.S. 233, 246–47 (1944).
