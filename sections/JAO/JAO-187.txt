remained a student. The Due Process Clause required that the stu-
dent be afforded the opportunity to show that he is or has become
a bona fide resident entitled to the lower tuition.1000
     Moreover, a food stamp program provision making ineligible any
household that contained a member age 18 or over who was claimed
as a dependent for federal income tax purposes the prior tax year
by a person not himself eligible for stamps was voided on the ground
that it created a conclusive presumption that fairly often could be
shown to be false if evidence could be presented.1001 The rule which
emerged for subjecting persons to detriment or qualifying them for
benefits was that the legislature may not presume the existence of
the decisive characteristic upon a given set of facts, unless it can
be shown that the defined characteristics do in fact encompass all
persons and only those persons that it was the purpose of the leg-
islature to reach. The doctrine in effect afforded the Court the op-
portunity to choose between resort to the Equal Protection Clause
or to the Due Process Clause in judging the validity of certain clas-
sifications,1002 and it precluded Congress and legislatures from mak-
ing general classifications that avoided the administrative costs of
individualization in many areas.
     Use of the doctrine was curbed if not halted, however, in
Weinberger v. Salfi,1003 in which the Court upheld the validity of a
Social Security provision requiring that the spouse of a covered wage
earner must have been married to the wage earner for at least nine
months prior to his death in order to receive benefits as a spouse.
Purporting to approve but to distinguish the prior cases in the line,1004
the Court imported traditional equal protection analysis into consid-
erations of due process challenges to statutory classifications.1005 Ex-
tensions of the prior cases to government entitlement classifica-
tions, such as the Social Security Act qualification standard before
it, would, said the Court, “turn the doctrine of those cases into a
virtual engine of destruction for countless legislative judgments which
have heretofore been thought wholly consistent with the Fifth and
    1000  Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441 (1973).
    1001  Department of Agriculture v. Murry, 413 U.S. 508 (1973).
     1002 Thus, on the some day Murry was decided, a similar food stamp qualifica-

tion was struck down on equal protection grounds. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno,
413 U.S. 528 (1973).
     1003 422 U.S. 749 (1975).
     1004 Stanley and LaFleur were distinguished as involving fundamental rights of

family and childbearing, 422 U.S. at 771, and Murry was distinguished as involving
an irrational classification. Id. at 772. Vlandis, said Justice Rehnquist for the Court,
meant no more than that when a state fixes residency as the qualification it may
not deny to one meeting the test of residency the opportunity so to establish it. Id.
at 771. But see id. at 802–03 (Justice Brennan dissenting).
     1005 422 U.S. at 768–70, 775–77, 785 (using Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471

(1970); Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78 (1971); and similar cases).
