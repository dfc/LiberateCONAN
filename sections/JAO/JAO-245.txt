as embodying a presumptively invalid racial classification.” 1303 It
is thus not impermissible merely to overturn a previous governmen-
tal decision, or to defeat the effort initially to arrive at such a deci-
sion, simply because the state action may conceivably encourage pri-
vate discrimination.
     In other instances in which the discrimination is being prac-
ticed by private parties, the question essentially is whether there
has been sufficient state involvement to bring the Fourteenth Amend-
ment into play.1304 There is no clear formula. “Only by sifting facts
and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the
State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.” 1305 State
action has been found in a number of circumstances. The “White
Primary” was outlawed by the Court not because the party’s dis-
crimination was commanded by statute but because the party oper-
ated under the authority of the state and the state prescribed a
general election ballot made up of party nominees chosen in the
primaries.1306 Although the City of Philadelphia was acting as trustee
in administering and carrying out the will of someone who had left
money for a college, admission to which was stipulated to be for
white boys only, the city was held to be engaged in forbidden state
action in discriminating against African-Americans in admis-
sion.1307 When state courts on petition of interested parties re-
moved the City of Macon as trustees of a segregated park that had
been left in trust for such use in a will, and appointed new trust-
ees in order to keep the park segregated, the Court reversed, find-
ing that the City was still inextricably involved in the maintenance
and operation of the park.1308
     In a significant case in which the Court explored a lengthy list
of contacts between the state and a private corporation, it held that
the lessee of property within an off-street parking building owned
and operated by a municipality could not exclude African-
Americans from its restaurant. The Court emphasized that the build-

     1307 Pennsylvania v. Board of Trustees, 353 U.S. 230 (1957). On remand, the

state courts substituted private persons as trustees to carry out the will. In re Girard
