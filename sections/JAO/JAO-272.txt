dence” 1456 that is more reminiscent of pre-Washington v. Davis cases
than of the more recent decisions.
     Rogers v. Lodge was also a multimember electoral district case
brought under the Equal Protection Clause 1457 and the Fifteenth
Amendment. The fact that the system operated to cancel out or di-
lute black voting strength, standing alone, was insufficient to con-
demn it; discriminatory intent in creating or maintaining the sys-
tem was necessary. But direct proof of such intent is not required.
“[A]n invidious purpose may often be inferred from the totality of
the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears
more heavily on one race than another.” 1458 Turning to the lower
court’s enunciation of standards, the Court approved the Zimmer
formulation. The fact that no black had ever been elected in the
county, in which blacks were a majority of the population but a mi-
nority of registered voters, was “important evidence of purposeful
exclusion.” 1459 Standing alone this fact was not sufficient, but a his-
torical showing of past discrimination, of systemic exclusion of blacks
from the political process as well as educational segregation and
discrimination, combined with continued unresponsiveness of elected
officials to the needs of the black community, indicated the pres-
ence of discriminatory motivation. The Court also looked to the “de-
pressed socio-economic status” of the black population as being both
a result of past discrimination and a barrier to black access to vot-
ing power.1460 As for the district court’s application of the test, the
Court reviewed it under the deferential “clearly erroneous” stan-
dard and affirmed it.
     The Court in a jury discrimination case also seemed to allow
what it had said in Davis and Arlington Heights it would not per-
mit.1461 Noting that disproportion alone is insufficient to establish
a violation, the Court nonetheless held that the plaintiff ’s showing
     1456 458 U.S. at 618–22 (describing and disagreeing with the Mobile plurality,

which had used the phrase at 446 U.S. 74). The Lodge Court approved the prior
reference that motive analysis required an analysis of “such circumstantial and di-
rect evidence” as was available. Id. at 618 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at
266).
     1457 The Court confirmed the Mobile analysis that the “fundamental interest”

side of heightened equal protection analysis requires a showing of intent when the
criteria of classification are neutral and did not reach the Fifteenth Amendment is-
sue in this case. 458 U.S. at 619 n.6.
     1458 458 U.S. at 618 (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)).
     1459 458 U.S. at 623–24.
     1460 458 U.S. at 624–27. The Court also noted the existence of other factors show-

ing the tendency of the system to minimize the voting strength of blacks, including
the large size of the jurisdiction and the maintenance of majority vote and single-
seat requirements and the absence of residency requirements.
     1461 Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482 (1977). The decision was 5-to-4, Justice

Blackmun writing the opinion of the Court and Chief Justice Burger and Justices
Stewart, Powell, and Rehnquist dissenting. Id. at 504–07.
