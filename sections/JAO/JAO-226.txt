fully accommodated the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid
penological interests,” it would suggest unreasonableness.1210
    Fourth Amendment protection is incompatible with “the con-
cept of incarceration and the needs and objectives of penal institu-
tions”; hence, a prisoner has no reasonable expectation of privacy
in his prison cell protecting him from “shakedown” searches de-
signed to root out weapons, drugs, and other contraband.1211 Av-
enues of redress “for calculated harassment unrelated to prison needs”
are not totally blocked, the Court indicated; inmates may still seek
protection in the Eighth Amendment or in state tort law.1212 Exis-
tence of “a meaningful postdeprivation remedy” for unauthorized,
intentional deprivation of an inmate’s property by prison personnel
protects the inmate’s due process rights.1213 Due process is not im-
plicated at all by negligent deprivation of life, liberty, or property
by prison officials.1214
    A change of the conditions under which a prisoner is housed,
including one imposed as a matter of discipline, may implicate a
protected liberty interest if such a change imposes an “atypical and
significant hardship” on the inmate.1215 In Wolff v. McDonnell,1216
the Court promulgated due process standards to govern the imposi-
tion of discipline upon prisoners. Due process applies, but, because
prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecu-
tion, the full panoply of a defendant’s rights is not available. Rather,
the analysis must proceed by identifying the interest in “liberty”
that the clause protects. Thus, where the state provides for good-
time credit or other privileges and further provides for forfeiture of
these privileges only for serious misconduct, the interest of the pris-
oner in this degree of “liberty” entitles him to the minimum proce-
dures appropriate under the circumstances.1217 What the minimum
procedures consist of is to be determined by balancing the prison-

    1211  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984); Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S.

trial detainees contact visits with spouses, children, relatives, and friends).

     1213 Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984) (holding that state tort law pro-

vided adequate postdeprivation remedies). But see Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113
(1990) (availability of postdeprivation remedy is inadequate when deprivation is fore-
seeable, predeprivation process was possible, and official conduct was not “unauthor-
ized”).
