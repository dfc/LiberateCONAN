fined.1259 Left to another day were such questions as “when, or by
what procedures, a mentally ill person may be confined by the State
on any of the grounds which, under contemporary statutes, are gen-
erally advanced to justify involuntary confinement of such a per-
son—to prevent injury to the public, to ensure his own survival or
safety, or to alleviate or cure his illness” 1260 and the right, if any,
to receive treatment for the confined person’s illness. To conform to
due process requirements, procedures for voluntary admission should
recognize the possibility that persons in need of treatment may not
be competent to give informed consent; this is not a situation where
availability of a meaningful post-deprivation remedy can cure the
due process violation.1261
    Procedurally, it is clear that an individual’s liberty interest in
being free from unjustifiable confinement and from the adverse so-
cial consequences of being labeled mentally ill requires the govern-
ment to assume a greater share of the risk of error in proving the
existence of such illness as a precondition to confinement. Thus, the
evidentiary standard of a preponderance, normally used in litiga-
tion between private parties, is constitutionally inadequate in com-
mitment proceedings. On the other hand, the criminal standard of
beyond a reasonable doubt is not necessary because the state’s aim
is not punitive and because some or even much of the consequence
of an erroneous decision not to commit may fall upon the indi-
vidual. Moreover, the criminal standard addresses an essentially fac-
tual question, whereas interpretative and predictive determina-
tions must also be made in reaching a conclusion on commitment.
The Court therefore imposed a standard of “clear and convincing”
evidence.1262
    In Parham v. J.R., the Court confronted difficult questions as
to what due process requires in the context of commitment of alleg-
edly mentally ill and mentally retarded children by their parents
or by the state, when such children are wards of the state.1263 Un-
der the challenged laws there were no formal preadmission hear-
ings, but psychiatric and social workers did interview parents and
children and reached some form of independent determination that
commitment was called for. The Court acknowledged the potential

mine whether Donaldson should recover personally from his doctors and others for
his confinement, under standards formulated under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Wood v.
