benefit district, the only privilege which he thereafter enjoys is to a
hearing upon the apportionment, that is, the amount of the tax which
he has to pay.506
    More specifically, where the mode of assessment resolves itself
into a mere mathematical calculation, there is no necessity for a
hearing.507 Statutes and ordinances providing for the paving and
grading of streets, the cost thereof to be assessed on the front foot
rule, do not, by their failure to provide for a hearing or review of
assessments, generally deprive a complaining owner of property with-
out due process of law.508 In contrast, when an attempt is made to
cast upon particular property a certain proportion of the construc-
tion cost of a sewer not calculated by any mathematical formula,
the taxpayer has a right to be heard.509
    Collection of Taxes.â€”States may undertake a variety of meth-
ods to collect taxes. For instance, collection of an inheritance tax
may be expedited by a statute requiring the sealing of safe deposit
boxes for at least ten days after the death of the renter and oblig-
ing the lessor to retain assets found therein sufficient to pay the
tax that may be due the state.510 A state may compel retailers to
collect such gasoline taxes from consumers and, under penalty of a
fine for delinquency, to remit monthly the amounts thus col-
lected.511 In collecting personal income taxes, most states require
employers to deduct and withhold the tax from the wages of employ-
ees.512
    States may also use various procedures to collect taxes from prior
tax years. To reach property that has escaped taxation, a state may
tax estates of decedents for a period prior to death and grant pro-
     506 Utley v. Petersburg, 292 U.S. 106, 109 (1934); French v. Barber Asphalt Pav-

ing Co., 181 U.S. 324, 341 (1901). See also Soliah v. Heskin, 222 U.S. 522 (1912).
Nor can he rightfully complain because the statute renders conclusive, after a hear-
ing, the determination as to apportionment by the same body which levied the as-
sessment. Hibben v. Smith, 191 U.S. 310, 321 (1903).
     507 Hancock v. Muskogee, 250 U.S. 454, 458 (1919). Likewise, a taxpayer does

not have a right to a hearing before a state board of equalization preliminary to
issuance by it of an order increasing the valuation of all property in a city by 40
percent. Bi-Metallic Co. v. Colorado, 239 U.S. 441 (1915).
     508 City of Detroit v. Parker, 181 U.S. 399 (1901).
     509 Paulsen v. Portland, 149 U.S. 30, 38 (1893).
     510 National Safe Deposit Co. v. Stead, 232 U.S. 58 (1914).
     511 Pierce Oil Corp. v. Hopkins, 264 U.S. 137 (1924). Likewise, a tax on the tan-

gible personal property of a nonresident owner may be collected from the custodian
or possessor of such property, and the latter, as an assurance of reimbursement, may
be granted a lien on such property. Carstairs v. Cochran, 193 U.S. 10 (1904); Han-
nis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, 216 U.S. 285 (1910).
     512 The duty thereby imposed on the employer has never been viewed as depriv-

ing him of property without due process of law, nor has the adjustment of his sys-
tem of accounting been viewed as an unreasonable regulation of the conduct of busi-
ness. Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., 252 U.S. 60, 75, 76 (1920).
