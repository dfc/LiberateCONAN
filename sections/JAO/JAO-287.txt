that the limitation of particular regulations to specified industries
was obnoxious to the Equal Protection Clause have been consis-
tently overruled.1539 Statutes limiting hours of labor for employees
in mines, smelters,1540 mills, factories,1541 or on public works 1542 have

redeemable at face value in cash was similarly held unobjection-
able.1543 The exemption of mines employing fewer than ten persons
