scrutiny.1789 However, the “political function” standard is elastic, and
so long as disqualifications are attached to specific occupations 1790
rather than to the civil service in general, as in Sugarman, the con-
cept seems capable of encompassing the exclusion.
    When confronted with a state statute that authorized local school
boards to exclude from public schools alien children who were not
legally admitted to the United States, the Court determined that
an intermediate level of scrutiny was appropriate and found that
the proffered justifications did not sustain the classification.1791 Be-
cause it was clear that the undocumented status of the children was
relevant to valid government goals, and because the Court had pre-
viously held that access to education was not a “fundamental inter-
est” that triggered strict scrutiny of governmental distinctions relat-
ing to education,1792 the Court’s decision to accord intermediate review
was based upon an amalgam of at least three factors. First, alien-
age was a characteristic that provokes special judicial protection when
used as a basis for discrimination. Second, the children were inno-
cent parties who were having a particular onus imposed on them
because of the misconduct of their parents. Third, the total denial
of an education to these children would stamp them with an “endur-
ing disability” that would harm both them and the state all their
lives.1793 The Court evaluated each of the state’s attempted justifi-
cations and found none of them satisfying the level of review de-
manded.1794 It seems evident that Plyler v. Doe is a unique case

    1790  Thus, the statute in Chavez-Salido applied to such positions as toll-service
employees, cemetery sextons, fish and game wardens, and furniture and bedding in-
spectors, and yet the overall classification was deemed not so ill-fitting as to require
its voiding.
     1791 Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 432 (1982). Joining the opinion of the Court were

Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, and Stevens. Dissenting were Chief
Justice Burger and Justices White, Rehnquist, and O’Connor. Id. at 242.
     1792 In San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), while holding

that education is not a fundamental interest, the Court expressly reserved the ques-
tion whether a total denial of education to a class of children would infringe upon a
fundamental interest. Id. at 18, 25 n.60, 37. The Plyler Court’s emphasis upon the
total denial of education and the generally suspect nature of alienage classifications
left ambiguous whether the state discrimination would have been subjected to strict
scrutiny if it had survived intermediate scrutiny. Justice Powell thought the Court
had rejected strict scrutiny, 457 U.S. at 238 n.2 (concurring), while Justice Blackmun
thought it had not reached the question, id. at 235 n.3 (concurring). Indeed, their
concurring opinions seem directed more toward the disability visited upon innocent
children than the broader complex of factors set out in the opinion of the Court. Id.
at 231, 236.
     1793 457 U.S. at 223–24.
     1794 Rejected state interests included preserving limited resources for its lawful

residents, deterring an influx of illegal aliens, avoiding the special burden caused
by these children, and serving children who were more likely to remain in the state
and contribute to its welfare. 457 U.S. at 227–30.
