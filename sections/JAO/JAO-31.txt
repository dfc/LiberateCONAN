ing mine managers and mine examiners, and imposing liability upon
mine owners for failure to furnish a reasonably safe place for work-
men, were upheld during this period.112 Other similar regulations
that were sustained included laws requiring that underground pas-
sageways meet or exceed a minimum width,113 that boundary pil-
lars be installed between adjoining coal properties as a protection
against flood in case of abandonment,114 and that wash houses be
provided for employees.115
    One of the more significant negative holdings of the Lochner
era was that states could not regulate how much wages were to be
paid to employees.116 As with the other working condition and wage
issues, however, concern for the welfare of women and children seemed
to weigh heavily on the justices, and restrictions on minimum wages
for these groups were discarded in 1937.117 Ultimately, the reason-
ing of these cases was extended to more broadly based minimum
wage laws, as the Court began to offer significant deference to the
states to enact economic and social legislation benefitting labor.
    The modern theory regarding substantive due process and wage
regulation was explained by Justice Douglas in 1952 in the follow-
ing terms: “Our recent decisions make plain that we do not sit as a
super-legislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation nor to decide
whether the policy which it expresses offends the public welfare.
The legislative power has limits. . . . But the state legislatures have
constitutional authority to experiment with new techniques; they
are entitled to their own standard of the public welfare; they may
within extremely broad limits control practices in the business-
labor field, so long as specific constitutional prohibitions are not vio-
lated and so long as conflicts with valid and controlling federal laws
are avoided.” 118

Missouri statute giving employees the right to absent themselves for four hours while
the polls were open on election day without deduction of wages for their absence).
The Court in Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. recognized that the legislation in question served
as a form of wage control for men, which had previously found unconstitutional.
Justice Douglas, however, wrote that “the protection of the right of suffrage under
our scheme of things is basic and fundamental,” and hence within the states’ police
power.
