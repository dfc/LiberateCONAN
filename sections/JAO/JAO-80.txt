a legislature has assumed to impose a tax upon land within the
jurisdiction of another State, much less where such action has been
defended by a court.” 419 Insofar as a tax payment may be viewed
as an exaction for the maintenance of government in consideration
of protection afforded, the logic sustaining this rule is self-evident.
    Tangible Personalty.—A state may tax tangible property lo-
cated within its borders (either directly through an ad valorem tax
or indirectly through death taxes) irrespective of the residence of
the owner.420 By the same token, if tangible personal property makes
only occasional incursions into other states, its permanent situs re-
mains in the state of origin, and, subject to certain exceptions, is
taxable only by the latter.421 The ancient maxim, mobilia sequuntur
personam, which originated when personal property consisted in the
main of articles appertaining to the person of the owner, yielded in
modern times to the “law of the place where the property is kept
and used.” The tendency has been to treat tangible personal prop-
erty as “having a situs of its own for the purpose of taxation, and
correlatively to . . . exempt [it] at the domicile of its owner.” 422
    Thus, when rolling stock is permanently located and used in a
business outside the boundaries of a domiciliary state, the latter
has no jurisdiction to tax it.423 Further, vessels that merely touch
briefly at numerous ports never acquire a taxable situs at any one
of them, and are taxable in the domicile of their owners or not at

     423 Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U.S. 194 (1905). Justice Black, in Cen-

tral R.R. v. Pennsylvania, 370 U.S. 607, 619–20 (1962), had his “doubts about the
use of the Due Process Clause to strike down state tax laws. The modern use of due
process to invalidate state taxes rests on two doctrines: (1) that a State is without
‘jurisdiction to tax’ property beyond its boundaries, and (2) that multiple taxation of
the same property by different States is prohibited. Nothing in the language or the
history of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, indicates any intention to establish
either of these two doctrines. . . . And in the first case [Railroad Co. v. Jackson, 74
U.S. (7 Wall.) 262 (1869)] striking down a state tax for lack of jurisdiction to tax
after the passage of that Amendment neither the Amendment nor its Due Process
Clause . . . was even mentioned.” He also maintained that Justice Holmes shared
this view in Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U.S. at 211.
