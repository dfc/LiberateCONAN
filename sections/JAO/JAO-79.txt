fer taxes to gifts or bequests of nonresidents; 3) allocation of the
income of multi-jurisdictional entities for tax purposes; 4) the scope
of state authority to tax income of nonresidents; and 5) collection
of state use taxes.
    The Court’s opinions in these cases have often discussed due
process and dormant commerce clause issues as if they were indis-
tinguishable.414 A later decision, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,415 how-
ever, used a two-tier analysis that found sufficient contact to sat-
isfy due process but not dormant commerce clause requirements.
In Quill,416 the Court struck down a state statute requiring an out-
of-state mail order company with neither outlets nor sales represen-
tatives in the state to collect and transmit use taxes on sales to
state residents, but did so based on Commerce Clause rather than
due process grounds. Taxation of an interstate business does not
offend due process, the Court held, if that business “purposefully
avails itself of the benefits of an economic market in the [taxing]
State . . . even if it has no physical presence in the State.” 417 Thus,
Quill may be read as implying that the more stringent Commerce
Clause standard subsumes due process jurisdictional issues, and that
consequently these due process issues need no longer be separately
considered.418 This interpretation has yet to be confirmed, however,
and a detailed review of due process precedents may prove useful.
    Real Property.—Even prior to the ratification of the Four-
teenth Amendment, it was a settled principle that a state could not
tax land situated beyond its limits. Subsequently elaborating upon
that principle, the Court has said that, “we know of no case where

merce and the dormant commerce clause, see Taxation, supra.

     416 504 U.S. 298 (1992).
     417 The Court had previously held that the requirement in terms of a benefit is

minimal. Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609 (1981), (quoting
Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U.S. 495, 521–23 (1937)). It is satis-
fied by a “minimal connection” between the interstate activities and the taxing State
and a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the in-
trastate values of the enterprise. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U.S.
425, 436–37 (1980); Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267, 272–73 (1978). See
especially Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Department of Revenue, 419 U.S. 560, 562
(1975); National Geographic Soc’y v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U.S. 551
(1977).
     418 A physical presence within the state is necessary, however, under the Com-

merce Clause analysis applicable to taxation of mail order sales. See Quill Corp. v.
North Dakota, 504 U.S. at 309–19 (refusing to overrule the Commerce Clause rul-
ing in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 756 (1967)).
See also Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dep’t of Treasury, 498 U.S. 358 (1991) (neither
the Commerce Clause nor the Due Process Clause is violated by application of a
business tax, measured on a value added basis, to a company that manufactures
goods in another state, but that operates a sales office and conducts sales within
state).
