that infringed a fundamental interest.1982 In Dunn v. Blumstein,1983
where the durational residency requirements denied the franchise
to newcomers, such administrative justifications were found consti-
tutionally insufficient to justify the classification.1984 The Privileges
or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the basis
for striking down a California law that limited welfare benefits for
California citizens who had resided in the state for less than a year
to the level of benefits that they would have received in the state
of their prior residence.1985
    However, a state one-year durational residency requirement for
the initiation of a divorce proceeding was sustained in Sosna v.
Iowa.1986 Although it is not clear what the precise basis of the rul-
ing is, it appears that the Court found that the state’s interest in
requiring that those who seek a divorce from its courts be genu-
inely attached to the state and its desire to insulate divorce de-
crees from the likelihood of collateral attack justified the require-
ment.1987 Similarly, durational residency requirements for lower in-
state tuition at public colleges have been held constitutionally
justifiable, again, however, without a clear statement of reason.1988
     1982 394 U.S. at 633–38. Shapiro was reaffirmed in Graham v. Richardson, 403

U.S. 365 (1971) (striking down durational residency requirements for aliens apply-
ing for welfare assistance), and in Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S.
250 (1974) (voiding requirement of one year’s residency in county as condition to
indigent’s receiving nonemergency hospitalization or medical care at county’s ex-
pense). When Connecticut and New York reinstituted the requirements, pleading a
financial emergency as the compelling state interest, they were summarily rebuffed.
Rivera v. Dunn, 329 F. Supp. 554 (D. Conn. 1971), aff ’d per curiam, 404 U.S. 1054
(1972); Lopez v. Wyman, Civ. No. 1971–308 (W.D.N.Y. 1971), aff ’d per curiam, 404
U.S. 1055 (1972). The source of the funds, state or federal, is irrelevant to applica-
tion of the principle. Pease v. Hansen, 404 U.S. 70 (1971).
     1983 405 U.S. 330 (1972). But see Marston v. Lewis, 410 U.S. 679 (1973), and

Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686 (1973). Durational residency requirements of five
and seven years respectively for candidates for elective office were sustained in Kanapaux
v. Ellisor, 419 U.S. 891 (1974), and Sununu v. Stark, 420 U.S. 958 (1975).

     1985 Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 505 (1999).
     1986 419 U.S. 393 (1975). Justices Marshall and Brennan dissented on the mer-

its. Id. at 418.
     1987 419 U.S. at 409. But the Court also indicated that the plaintiff was not ab-

solutely barred from the state courts, but merely required to wait for access (which
was true in the prior cases as well and there held immaterial), and that possibly
the state interests in marriage and divorce were more exclusive and thus more im-
mune from federal constitutional attack than were the matters at issue in the pre-
vious cases. The Court also did not indicate whether it was using strict or tradi-
tional scrutiny.
     1988 Starns v. Malkerson, 326 F. Supp. 234 (D. Minn. 1970), aff ’d per curiam,

401 U.S. 985 (1971). Cf. Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 452 & n.9 (1973), and id. at
456, 464, 467 (dicta). In Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 256
(1974), the Court, noting the results, stated that “some waiting periods . . . may not
be penalties” and thus would be valid.
