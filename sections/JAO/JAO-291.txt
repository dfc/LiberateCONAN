Clause on several grounds. On the basis of the right infringed by
the limitation, the Court saw no rational basis for the state to dis-
tinguish between married and unmarried persons. Similarly, the ex-
emption from the prohibition for purposes of disease prevention nul-
lified the argument that the rational basis for the law was the
deterrence of fornication, the rationality of which the Court doubted
in any case.1572 Also denying equal protection was a law affording
married parents, divorced parents, and unmarried mothers an op-
portunity to be heard with regard to the issue of their fitness to
continue or to take custody of their children, an opportunity the
Court decided was mandated by due process, but presuming the un-
fitness of the unmarried father and giving him no hearing.1573
     Punishment of Crime.â€”Equality of protection under the law
implies that in the administration of criminal justice no person shall
be subject to any greater or different punishment than another in
similar circumstances.1574 Comparative gravity of criminal offenses
is, however, largely a matter of state discretion, and the fact that
some offenses are punished with less severity than others does not
deny equal protection.1575 Heavier penalties may be imposed upon
habitual criminals for like offenses,1576 even after a pardon for an
earlier offense,1577 and such persons may be made ineligible for pa-
role.1578 A state law doubling the sentence on prisoners attempting
to escape does not deny equal protection by subjecting prisoners who
attempt to escape together to different sentences depending on their
original sentences.1579
    A statute denying state prisoners good-time credit for pre-
sentence incarceration, but permitting those prisoners who obtain
bail or other release immediately to receive good-time credit for the
entire period that they ultimately spend in custody, good time count-

545 (1954), sustaining law rendering illegally seized evidence inadmissible in pros-
ecutions in state courts for misdemeanors but permitting use of such evidence in
one county in prosecutions for certain gambling misdemeanors. Distinctions based
on county areas were deemed reasonable. In North v. Russell, 427 U.S. 328 (1976),
the Court sustained the provision of law-trained judges for some police courts and
lay judges for others, depending upon the state constitutional classification of cities
according to population, since as long as all people within each classified area are
treated equally, the different classifications within the court system are justifiable.
