     In Washington v. Davis, the Court held that is necessary that
one claiming harm based on the disparate or disproportionate im-
pact of a facially neutral law prove intent or motive to discrimi-
nate.1440 For a time, in reliance upon a prior Supreme Court deci-
sion that had seemed to eschew motive or intent and to pinpoint
effect as the key to a constitutional violation, lower courts had ques-
tioned this proposition.1441 Further, the Court had considered vari-
ous civil rights statutes which provided that when employment prac-
tices are challenged for disqualifying a disproportionate numbers
of blacks, discriminatory purpose need not be proved and that dem-
onstrating a rational basis for the challenged practices was not a
sufficient defense.1442 Thus, the lower federal courts developed a con-
stitutional “disproportionate impact” analysis under which, absent
some justification going substantially beyond what would be neces-
sary to validate most other classifications, a violation could be es-
tablished without regard to discriminatory purpose by showing that
a statute or practice adversely affected a class.1443 These cases were

     1440 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976) (“[A] law, neutral on its face and serving ends

otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is not invalid under the Equal
Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than
of another.”) A classification having a differential impact, absent a showing of dis-
criminatory purpose, is subject to review under the lenient, rationality standard. Id.
at 247–48; Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617 n.5 (1982). The Court has applied the
same standard to a claim of selective prosecution allegedly penalizing exercise of
First Amendment rights. Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985) (no discrimi-
natory purpose shown). See also Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986) (existence
of single-race, state-sponsored 4–H Clubs is permissible, given wholly voluntary na-
ture of membership).
     1441 The principal case was Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217 (1971), in which

a 5-to-4 majority refused to order a city to reopen its swimming pools closed alleg-
edly to avoid complying with a court order to desegregate them. The majority opin-
ion strongly warned against voiding governmental action upon an assessment of of-
ficial motive, id. at 224–26, but it also drew the conclusion (and the Davis Court
read it as actually deciding) that, because the pools were closed for both whites and
blacks, there was no discrimination. The city’s avowed reason for closing the pools—to
avoid violence and economic loss—could not be impeached by allegations of a racial
motive. See also Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451 (1972).
     1442 Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,

422 U.S. 405 (1975). The Davis Court adhered to this reading of Title VII, merely
refusing to import the statutory standard into the constitutional standard. Washing-
ton v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 238–39, 246–48 (1976). Subsequent cases involving gen-
der discrimination raised the question of the vitality of Griggs, General Electric Co.
v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976); Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136 (1977), but
the disagreement among the Justices appears to be whether Griggs applies to each
section of the antidiscrimination provision of Title VII. See Dothard v. Rawlinson,
433 U.S. 321 (1977); Furnco Const. Co. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567 (1978). But see Gen-
eral Building Contractors Ass’n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375 (1982) (unlike Title
VII, under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, derived from the Civil Rights Act of 1866, proof of dis-
criminatory intent is required).
     1443 See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 244 n.12 (1976) (listing and disap-

proving cases). Cases that the Court did not cite include those in which the Fifth
Circuit wrestled with the distinction between de facto and de jure segregation. In
