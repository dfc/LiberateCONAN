several voting cases in which restrictions were voided, and the doc-
trine was asserted in other cases.1426
    Although no opinion of the Court attempted to delineate the pro-
cess by which certain “fundamental” rights were differentiated from
others,1427 it was evident from the cases that the right to vote,1428
the right of interstate travel,1429 the right to be free of wealth dis-
tinctions in the criminal process, 1430 and the right of procre-
ation 1431 were at least some of those interests that triggered active
review when de jure or de facto official distinctions were made with
respect to them. In Rodriguez,1432 the Court also sought to rational-
ize and restrict this branch of active review, as that case involved
both a claim that de facto wealth classifications should be suspect
and a claim that education was a fundamental interest, so that pro-
viding less of it to people because they were poor triggered a com-
pelling state interest standard. The Court readily agreed that edu-
cation was an important value in our society. “But the importance
of a service performed by the State does not determine whether it
must be regarded as fundamental for purposes of examination un-
der the Equal Protection Clause. . . . [T]he answer lies in assess-
ing whether there is a right to education explicitly or implicitly guar-
anteed by the Constitution.” 1433 A right to education is not expressly
protected by the Constitution, continued the Court, and it was un-
willing to find an implied right because of its undoubted impor-
tance.
     But just as Rodriguez did not ultimately prevent the Court’s adop-
tion of a “three-tier” or “sliding-tier” standard of review, Justice Pow-
ell’s admonition that only interests expressly or impliedly protected
by the Constitution should be considered “fundamental” did not pre-
vent the expansion of the list of such interests. The difficulty was
that Court decisions on the right to vote, the right to travel, the
right to procreate, as well as other rights, premise the constitu-
tional violation to be of the Equal Protection Clause, which does
not itself guarantee the right but prevents the differential govern-
