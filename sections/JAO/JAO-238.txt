tions,1270 the doctrine is most often associated with the application
of the Equal Protection Clause to the states.1271
    Certainly, an act passed by a state legislature that directs a dis-
criminatory result is state action and would violate the first sec-
tion of the Fourteenth Amendment.1272 In addition, acts by other
branches of government “by whatever instruments or in whatever
modes that action may be taken” can result in a finding of “state
action.” 1273 But the difficulty for the Court has been when the con-
duct complained of is not so clearly the action of a state. For in-
stance, is it state action when a minor state official’s act was not
authorized or perhaps was even forbidden by state law? What if a
private party engages in discrimination while in a special relation-
ship with governmental authority? “The vital requirement is State
responsibility,” Justice Frankfurter once wrote, “that somewhere, some-
how, to some extent, there be an infusion of conduct by officials,
panoplied with State power, into any scheme” to deny protected
rights.1274
    The state action doctrine is not just a textual interpretation of
the Fourteenth Amendment, but may also serve the purposes of fed-
eralism. Thus, following the Civil War, when the Court sought to
other constitutional rights are similarly limited—the Fifteenth Amendment (racial
discrimination in voting), the Nineteenth Amendment (sex discrimination in voting)
and the Twenty-sixth Amendment (voting rights for 18-year olds)—although the Thir-
teenth Amendment, banning slavery and involuntary servitude, is not.
     1270 The scope and reach of the “state action” doctrine is the same whether a

state or the National Government is concerned. See CBS v. Democratic Nat’l Comm.,
412 U.S. 94 (1973).
     1271 Recently, however, because of broadening due process conceptions and the

resulting litigation, issues of state action have been raised with respect to the Due
Process Clause. See, e.g., Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345 (1974);
Flagg Bros. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978); Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830
(1982); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982); Blum v. Yaretsky, 457
U.S. 991 (1982).
     1272 United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 25 (1960). A prime example is the

statutory requirement of racially segregated schools condemned in Brown v. Board
of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). See also Peterson v. City of Greenville, 373 U.S.
244 (1963), holding that trespass convictions of African-Americans “sitting-in” at a
lunch counter over the objection of the manager cannot stand because of a local or-
dinance commanding such separation, irrespective of the manager’s probable atti-
tude if no such ordinance existed.
     1273 Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346 (1880). “A State acts by its legislative,

its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. The constitu-
tional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers
or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its juris-
diction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under
a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due pro-
cess of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the
constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed
with the State’s power, his act is that of the State.” Id. at 346–47
     1274 Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 473 (1953) (concurring) (concerning the Fif-

teenth Amendment).
