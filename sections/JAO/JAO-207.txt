nal cases,1103 but, because the standard was so widely accepted, it
was only relatively recently that the Court had the opportunity to
pronounce it guaranteed by due process. In 1970, the Court held in
In re Winship that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Four-
teenth Amendments “[protect] the accused against conviction ex-
cept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary
to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” 1104
    The standard is closely related to the presumption of inno-
cence, which helps to ensure a defendant a fair trial,1105 and re-
quires that a jury consider a case solely on the evidence.1106 “The
reasonable doubt standard plays a vital role in the American scheme
of criminal procedure. It is a prime instrument for reducing the risk
of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides con-
crete substance for the presumption of innocence—that bedrock ‘axi-
omatic and elementary’ principle whose ‘enforcement lies at the foun-
dation of the administration of our criminal law.’ ” 1107
   The Court had long held that, under the Due Process Clause, it
would set aside convictions that are supported by no evidence at

See also Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993) (Sixth Amendment guarantee of
trial by jury requires a jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt). On the
interrelationship of the reasonable doubt burden and defendant’s entitlement to a
presumption of innocence, see Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478, 483–86 (1978), and
Kentucky v. Whorton, 441 U.S. 786 (1979).

Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990) (per curiam) (jury instruction that explains “reason-
able doubt” as doubt that would give rise to a “grave uncertainty,” as equivalent to
a “substantial doubt,” and as requiring “a moral certainty,” suggests a higher de-
gree of certainty than is required for acquittal, and therefore violates the Due Pro-
cess Clause). But see Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1 (1994) (considered as a whole,
jury instructions that define “reasonable doubt” as requiring a “moral certainty” or
as equivalent to “substantial doubt” did not violate due process because other clari-
fying language was included.)

in which the Court held that the presumption of innocence was evidence from which
the jury could find a reasonable doubt.

Justice Harlan’s Winship concurrence, id. at 368, proceeded on the basis that, be-
cause there is likelihood of error in any system of reconstructing past events, the
error of convicting the innocent should be reduced to the greatest extent possible
through the use of the reasonable doubt standard.
