and did not operate any law school open to African-Americans vio-
lated an applicant’s right to equal protection, even though the state
offered to pay his tuition at an out-of-state law school. The require-
ment of the clause was for equal facilities within the state.1597 When
Texas established a law school for African-Americans after the plain-
tiff had applied and been denied admission to the school main-
tained for whites, the Court held the action to be inadequate, find-
ing that the nature of law schools and the associations possible in
the white school necessarily meant that the separate school was un-
equal.1598 Equally objectionable was the fact that when Oklahoma
admitted an African-American law student to its only law school it
required him to remain physically separate from the other stu-
dents.1599
     Brown v. Board of Education.—“Separate but equal” was for-
mally abandoned in Brown v. Board of Education,1600 which in-
volved challenges to segregation per se in the schools of four states
in which the lower courts had found that the schools provided were
equalized or were in the process of being equalized. Though the Court
had asked for argument on the intent of the framers, extensive re-
search had proved inconclusive, and the Court asserted that it could
not “turn the clock back to 1867 . . . or even to 1896,” but must
rather consider the issue in the context of the vital importance of
education in 1954. The Court reasoned that denial of opportunity
for an adequate education would often be a denial of the opportu-
nity to succeed in life, that separation of the races in the schools
solely on the basis of race must necessarily generate feelings of in-
feriority in the disfavored race adversely affecting education as well
as other matters, and therefore that the Equal Protection Clause
was violated by such separation. “We conclude that in the field of
public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.
Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” 1601
     After hearing argument on what remedial order should issue,
the Court remanded the cases to the lower courts to adjust the ef-
fectuation of its mandate to the particularities of each school dis-
trict. “At stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admis-
sion to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory
basis.” The lower courts were directed to “require that the defen-
