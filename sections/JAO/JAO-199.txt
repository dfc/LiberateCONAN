process grounds.1063 Defendants have had difficulty meeting the
Court’s standards: Only one challenge has been successful.1064
     Fair Trial.—As noted, the provisions of the Bill of Rights now
applicable to the states contain basic guarantees of a fair trial—
right to counsel, right to speedy and public trial, right to be free
from use of unlawfully seized evidence and unlawfully obtained con-
fessions, and the like. But this does not exhaust the requirements
of fairness. “Due process of law requires that the proceedings shall
be fair, but fairness is a relative, not an absolute concept. . . . What
is fair in one set of circumstances may be an act of tyranny in oth-
ers.” 1065 Conversely, “as applied to a criminal trial, denial of due
process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essen-
tial to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it
. . . [the Court] must find that the absence of that fairness fatally
infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as
necessarily prevents a fair trial.” 1066
     For instance, bias or prejudice either inherent in the structure
of the trial system or as imposed by external events will deny one’s
right to a fair trial. Thus, in Tumey v. Ohio 1067 it was held to vio-
late due process for a judge to receive compensation out of the fines
imposed on convicted defendants, and no compensation beyond his
salary) “if he does not convict those who are brought before him.”
     1063 The Court eschewed a per se exclusionary rule in due process cases at least

as early as Stovall. 388 U.S. 293, 302 (1967). In Manson v. Brathwaite, the Court
evaluated application of a per se rule versus the more flexible, ad hoc “totality of
the circumstances” rule, and found the latter to be preferable in the interests of
deterrence and the administration of justice. 432 U.S. 98, 111–14 (1977). The rule
in due process cases differs from the per se exclusionary rule adopted in the Wade-
Gilbert line of cases on denial of the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment in
post-indictment lineups. Cases refining the Wade-Gilbert holdings include Kirby v.
Illinois, 406 U.S. 682 (1972) (right to counsel inapplicable to post-arrest police sta-
tion identification made before formal initiation of criminal proceedings; due process
protections remain available) and United States v. Ash, 413 U.S. 300 (1973) (right
to counsel inapplicable at post-indictment display of photographs to prosecution wit-
nesses out of defendant’s presence; record insufficient to assess possible due process
claim).
     1064 Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440 (1969) (5–4) (“[T]he pretrial confronta-

tions [between the witness and the defendant] clearly were so arranged as to make
the resulting identifications virtually inevitable.”). In a limited class of cases, pre-
trial identifications have been found to be constitutionally objectionable on a basis
other than due process. See discussion of Assistance of Counsel under Amend. VI,
“Lineups and Other Identification Situations.”
     1065 Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 116, 117 (1934). See also Buchalter v.

New York, 319 U.S. 427, 429 (1943).
     1066 Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236 (1941).
     1067 273 U.S. 510, 520 (1927). See also Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S.

57 (1972). But see Dugan v. Ohio, 277 U.S. 61 (1928). Bias or prejudice of an appel-
late judge can also deprive a litigant of due process. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. LaVoie,
475 U.S. 813 (1986) (failure of state supreme court judge with pecuniary interest—a
pending suit on an indistinguishable claim—to recuse).
