class.1474 Also, discriminations of an unusual character are scruti-
nized with special care.1475 A gross sales tax graduated at increas-
ing rates with the volume of sales,1476 a heavier license tax on each
unit in a chain of stores where the owner has stores located in more
than one country,1477 and a gross receipts tax levied on corpora-
tions operating taxicabs, but not on individuals,1478 have been held
to be a repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause. But it is not the
function of the Court to consider the propriety or justness of the
tax, to seek for the motives and criticize the public policy which
prompted the adoption of the statute.1479 If the evident intent and
general operation of the tax legislation is to adjust the burden with
a fair and reasonable degree of equality, the constitutional require-
ment is satisfied.1480
    One not within the class claimed to be discriminated against
cannot challenge the constitutionality of a statute on the ground
that it denies equal protection of the law.1481 If a tax applies to a
class that may be separately taxed, those within the class may not
complain because the class might have been more aptly defined or
because others, not of the class, are taxed improperly.1482
    Foreign Corporations and Nonresidents.—The Equal Pro-
tection Clause does not require identical taxes upon all foreign and
domestic corporations in every case.1483 In 1886, a Pennsylvania cor-
poration previously licensed to do business in New York challenged
an increased annual license tax imposed by that state in retalia-
tion for a like tax levied by Pennsylvania against New York corpo-
rations. This tax was held valid on the ground that the state, hav-
ing power to exclude entirely, could change the conditions of admission
for the future and could demand the payment of a new or further
tax as a license fee.1484 Later cases whittled down this rule consid-
erably. The Court decided that “after its admission, the foreign cor-
poration stands equal and is to be classified with domestic corpora-
