     Moreover, in City of Mobile v. Bolden 1450 a plurality of the Court
apparently attempted to do away with the totality of circumstances
test and to separately evaluate each of the factors offered to show
a discriminatory intent. At issue was the constitutionality of the
use of multi-member electoral districts to select the city commis-
sion. A prior decision had invalidated a multi-member districting
system as discriminatory against blacks and Hispanics by listing
and weighing a series of factors which in totality showed invidious
discrimination, but the Court did not consider whether its ruling
was premised on discriminatory purpose or adverse impact.1451 But
in the plurality opinion in Mobile, each of the factors, viewed “alone,”
was deemed insufficient to show purposeful discrimination.1452 More-
over, the plurality suggested that some of the factors thought to be
derived from its precedents and forming part of the totality test in
opinions of the lower federal courts—such as minority access to the
candidate selection process, governmental responsiveness to minor-
ity interests, and the history of past discrimination—were of quite
limited significance in determining discriminatory intent.1453 But,
contemporaneously with Congress’s statutory rejection of the Mo-
bile plurality standards,1454 the Court, in Rogers v. Lodge,1455 ap-
peared to disavow much of Mobile and to permit the federal courts
to find discriminatory purpose on the basis of “circumstantial evi-
man, 443 U.S. 526 (1979), in the context of the quotation in the text. These cases
found the Davis standard satisfied on a showing of past discrimination coupled with
foreseeable impact in the school segregation area.
     1450 446 U.S. 55 (1980). Also decided by the plurality was that discriminatory

purpose is a requisite showing to establish a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment
and of the Equal Protection Clause in the “fundamental interest” context, vote dilu-
tion, rather than just in the suspect classification context.
     1451 White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1972), was the prior case. See also Whitcomb

v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971). Justice White, the author of Register, dissented in
Mobile, 446 U.S. at 94, on the basis that “the totality of the facts relied upon by the
District Court to support its inference of purposeful discrimination is even more com-
pelling than that present in White v. Register.” Justice Blackmun, id. at 80, and
Justices Brennan and Marshall, agreed with him as alternate holdings, id. at 94,
103.
     1452 446 U.S. at 65–74.
     1453 446 U.S. at 73–74. The principal formulation of the test was in Zimmer v.

McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297, 1305 (5th Cir. 1973), aff’d on other grounds sub nom.
East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636 (1976), and its components
are thus frequently referred to as the Zimmer factors.
     1454 By the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, P.L. 97–205, 96 Stat. 131,

42 U.S.C. § 1973 (as amended), see S. REP. NO. 417, 97th Congress, 2d Sess. 27–28
(1982), Congress proscribed a variety of electoral practices “which results” in a de-
nial or abridgment of the right to vote, and spelled out in essence the Zimmer fac-
tors as elements of a “totality of the circumstances” test.
     1455 458 U.S. 613 (1982). The decision, handed down within days of final congres-

sional passage of the Voting Rights Act Amendments, was written by Justice White
and joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and
O’Connor. Justices Powell and Rehnquist dissented, id. at 628, as did Justice Ste-
vens. Id. at 631.
