of constitutional provisions.554 Not only was this right to be pro-
tected again governmental intrusion, but there was apparently little
or no consideration to be given to what governmental interests might
justify such an intrusion upon the marital bedroom.
    The apparent lack of deference to state interests in Griswold
was borne out in the early abortion cases, discussed in detail be-
low, which required the showing of a “compelling state interest” to
interfere with a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.555 Yet, in
other contexts, the Court appears to have continued to use a “rea-
sonableness” standard.556 More recently, the Court has complicated
the issue further (again in the abortion context) by the addition of
yet another standard, “undue burden.” 557
     A further problem confronting the Court is how such abstract
rights, once established, are to be delineated. For instance, the con-
stitutional protections afforded to marriage, family, and procre-
ation in Griswold have been extended by the Court to apply to mar-
ried and unmarried couples alike. 558 However, in Bowers v.
Hardwick,559 the Court majority rejected a challenge to a Georgia
sodomy law despite the fact that it prohibited types of intimate ac-
tivities engaged in by married as well as unmarried couples.560 Then,

     554 The analysis, while reminiscent of the “right to privacy” first suggested by

Warren and Brandeis, still approached the matter in reliance on substantive due
process cases. It should be noted that the separate concurrences of Justices Harlan
and White were specifically based on substantive due process, 381 U.S. at 499, 502,
which indicates that the majority’s position was intended to be something different.
Justice Goldberg, on the other hand, in concurrence, would have based the decision
on the Ninth Amendment. 381 U.S. at 486–97. See analysis under the Ninth Amend-
ment, “Rights Retained By the People,” supra.
     555 See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).
     556 When the Court began to extend “privacy” rights to unmarried person through

the equal protection clause, it seemed to rely upon a view of rationality and reason-
ableness not too different from Justice Harlan’s dissent in Poe v. Ullman. Eisenstadt
v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), is the principal case. See also Stanley v. Illinois, 405
U.S. 645 (1972).
     557 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833

(1992).
     558 See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972). “If under Griswold the

distribution of contraceptives to married persons cannot be prohibited, a ban on dis-
tribution to unmarried persons would be equally impermissible. It is true that in
Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet
the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own,
but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emo-
tional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the indi-
vidual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into
matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or be-
get a child.” 405 U.S. at 453.
     559 478 U.S. 186 (1986).
     560 The Court upheld the statute only as applied to the plaintiffs, who were ho-

mosexuals, 478 U.S. at 188 (1986), and thus rejected an argument that there is a
“fundamental right of homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy.” Id. at
