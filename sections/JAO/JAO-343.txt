purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any in-
quiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.” 1834
Rather, after specifically citing the heightened scrutiny that all sex
classifications are subjected to, the Court looks to the statute and
to its legislative history to ascertain that the scheme does not actu-
ally penalize women, that it was actually enacted to compensate
for past discrimination, and that it does not reflect merely “archaic
and overbroad generalizations” about women in its moving force.
But where a statute is “deliberately enacted to compensate for par-
ticular economic disabilities suffered by women,” it serves an impor-
tant governmental objective and will be sustained if it is substan-
tially related to achievement of that objective.1835
     Many of these lines of cases converged in Mississippi Univer-
sity for Women v. Hogan,1836 in which the Court stiffened and ap-
plied its standards for evaluating claimed benign distinctions ben-
efitting women and additionally appeared to apply the intermediate
standard itself more strictly. The case involved a male nurse who
wished to attend a female-only nursing school located in the city in
which he lived and worked; if he could not attend this particular
school he would have had to commute 147 miles to another nurs-
ing school that did accept men, and he would have had difficulty
doing so and retaining his job. The state defended on the basis that
the female-only policy was justified as providing “educational affir-
mative action for females.” Recitation of a benign purpose, the Court
said, was not alone sufficient. “[A] State can evoke a compensatory
purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if
members of the gender benefitted by the classification actually suf-
fer a disadvantage related to the classification.” 1837 But women did
not lack opportunities to obtain training in nursing; instead they
dominated the field. In the Court’s view, the state policy did not
compensate for discriminatory barriers facing women, but it perpetu-
ated the stereotype of nursing as a woman’s job. “[A]lthough the
State recited a ‘benign, compensatory purpose,’ it failed to estab-

Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150–52 (1980). In light of the stiffened
standard, Justice Stevens has called for overruling Kahn, Califano v. Goldfarb, 430
U.S. at 223–24, but Justice Blackmun would preserve that case. Orr v. Orr, 440
U.S. at 284. Cf. Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 302–03
(1978) (Justice Powell; less stringent standard of review for benign sex classifica-
tions).
     1835 Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316–18, 320 (1977). There was no doubt

that the provision sustained in Webster had been adopted expressly to relieve past
societal discrimination. The four Goldfarb dissenters concurred specially, finding no
difference between the two provisions. Id. at 321.
