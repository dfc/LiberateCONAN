ery; that a decision be made based on the record, and that a party
be allowed to be represented by counsel.
    (1) Notice. “An elementary and fundamental requirement of due
process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice
reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise inter-
ested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an op-
portunity to present their objections.” 721 This may include an obli-
gation, upon learning that an attempt at notice has failed, to take
“reasonable followup measures” that may be available.722 In addi-
tion, notice must be sufficient to enable the recipient to determine
what is being proposed and what he must do to prevent the depri-
vation of his interest.723 Ordinarily, service of the notice must be
reasonably structured to assure that the person to whom it is di-
rected receives it.724 Such notice, however, need not describe the le-
gal procedures necessary to protect one’s interest if such proce-
dures are otherwise set out in published, generally available public
sources.725
    (2) Hearing. “[S]ome form of hearing is required before an indi-
vidual is finally deprived of a property [or liberty] interest.” 726 This
right is a “basic aspect of the duty of government to follow a fair
process of decision making when it acts to deprive a person of his
possessions. The purpose of this requirement is not only to ensure
abstract fair play to the individual. Its purpose, more particularly,
is to protect his use and possession of property from arbitrary en-
croachment . . . .” 727 Thus, the notice of hearing and the opportu-
nity to be heard “must be granted at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner.” 728
