     The termination of welfare benefits in Goldberg v. Kelly,821 which
could have resulted in a “devastating” loss of food and shelter, had
required a pre-deprivation hearing. The termination of Social Secu-
rity benefits at issue in Mathews would require less protection, how-
ever, because those benefits are not based on financial need and a
terminated recipient would be able to apply for welfare if need be.
Moreover, the determination of ineligibility for Social Security ben-
efits more often turns upon routine and uncomplicated evaluations
of data, reducing the likelihood of error, a likelihood found signifi-
cant in Goldberg. Finally, the administrative burden and other so-
cietal costs involved in giving Social Security recipients a pre-
termination hearing would be high. Therefore, a post-termination
hearing, with full retroactive restoration of benefits, if the claimant
prevails, was found satisfactory.822
    Application of the Mathews standard and other considerations
brought some noteworthy changes to the process accorded debtors
and installment buyers. Earlier cases, which had focused upon the
interests of the holders of the property in not being unjustly de-
prived of the goods and funds in their possession, leaned toward
requiring pre-deprivation hearings. Newer cases, however, look to
the interests of creditors as well. “The reality is that both seller
and buyer had current, real interests in the property, and the defi-
nition of property rights is a matter of state law. Resolution of the
due process question must take account not only of the interests of
the buyer of the property but those of the seller as well.” 823
    Thus, Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp.,824 which mandated pre-
deprivation hearings before wages may be garnished, has appar-
ently been limited to instances when wages, and perhaps certain
other basic necessities, are in issue and the consequences of depri-
vation would be severe.825 Fuentes v. Shevin,826 which struck down
    821  397 U.S. 254, 264 (1970).
    822  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 339–49 (1976).
     823 Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 604 (1975). See also id. at 623 (Jus-

tice Powell concurring), 629 (Justices Stewart, Douglas, and Marshall dissenting).
Justice White, who wrote Mitchell and included the balancing language in his dis-
sent in Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 99–100 (1972), did not repeat it in North
Georgia Finishing v. Di-Chem, 419 U.S. 601 (1975), but it presumably underlies the
reconciliation of Fuentes and Mitchell in the latter case and the application of Di-
Chem.

     825 North Georgia Finishing v. Di-Chem, 419 U.S. 601, 611 n.2 (1975) (Justice

Powell concurring). The majority opinion draws no such express distinction, see id.
at 605–06, rather emphasizing that Sniadach-Fuentes do require observance of some
due process procedural guarantees. But see Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600,
614 (1974) (opinion of Court by Justice White emphasizing the wages aspect of the
earlier case).
