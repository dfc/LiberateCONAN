enues of relief alleged in Boddie was not at issue. As in Boddie,
however, the Court focused on the substantive due process implica-
tions of the state’s limiting “[c]hoices about marriage, family life,
and the upbringing of children,” 2052 while also referencing cases es-
tablishing a right of equal access to criminal appellate review. Not-
ing that even a petty offender had a right to have the state pay for
the transcript needed for an effective appeal,2053 and that the forced
dissolution of parental rights was “more substantial than mere loss
of money,” 2054 the Court ordered Mississippi to provide the plaintiff
the court records necessary to pursue her appeal.
     Educational Opportunity.—Making even clearer its ap-
proach in de facto wealth classification cases, the Court in San An-
tonio School District v. Rodriguez 2055 rebuffed an intensive effort
with widespread support in lower court decisions to invalidate the
system prevalent in 49 of the 50 states of financing schools primar-
ily out of property taxes, with the consequent effect that the funds
available to local school boards within each state were widely diver-
gent. Plaintiffs had sought to bring their case within the strict scru-
tiny—compelling state interest doctrine of equal protection review
by claiming that under the tax system there resulted a de facto wealth
classification that was “suspect” or that education was a “fundamen-
tal” right and the disparity in educational financing could not there-
fore be justified. The Court held, however, that there was neither a
suspect classification nor a fundamental interest involved, that the
system must be judged by the traditional restrained standard, and
that the system was rationally related to the state’s interest in pro-
tecting and promoting local control of education.2056
    Important as the result of the case is, the doctrinal implica-
tions are far more important. The attempted denomination of wealth
as a suspect classification failed on two levels. First, the Court noted
that plaintiffs had not identified the “class of disadvantaged ‘poor’ ”
in such a manner as to further their argument. That is, the Court
found that the existence of a class of poor persons, however de-
fined, did not correlate with property-tax-poor districts; neither as
an absolute nor as a relative consideration did it appear that tax-
poor districts contained greater numbers of poor persons than did

Chief Justice and Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Rehnquist. Justices Douglas, Bren-
nan, White, and Marshall dissented. Id. at 62, 63, 70.
    2056 411 U.S. at 44–55. Applying the rational justification test, Justice White would

have found that the system did not use means rationally related to the end sought
to be achieved. Id. at 63.
