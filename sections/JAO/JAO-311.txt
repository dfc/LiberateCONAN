the opponent of the strike.’ ” 1677 “On appeal, a trial court’s ruling
on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is
clearly erroneous,” 1678 but, on more than one occasion, the Su-
preme Court has reversed trial courts’ findings of no discrimina-
tory intent.1679 The Court has also extended Batson to apply to ra-
cially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by private litigants
in civil litigation,1680 and by a defendant in a criminal case,1681 the
principal issue in these cases being the presence of state action, not
the invalidity of purposeful racial discrimination.
    Discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen presents
a closer question, the answer to which depends in part on the re-
sponsibilities of a foreman in the particular system challenged. Thus,
the Court “assumed without deciding” that discrimination in selec-
tion of foremen for state grand juries would violate equal protec-
tion in a system in which the judge selected a foreman to serve as
a thirteenth voting juror, and that foreman exercised significant pow-

a discriminatory intent was a substantial or motivating factor in an action taken by
a state actor, the burden shifts to the party defending the action to show that this
factor was not determinative. We have not previously applied this rule in a Batson
case, and we need not decide here whether that standard governs in this con-
text. . . . [Nevertheless,] a peremptory strike shown to have been motivated in sub-
stantial part by a discriminatory intent could not be sustained based on any lesser
showing by the prosecution.” Snyder v. Louisiana, 128 S. Ct. 1203, 1212 (2008) (cita-
tion omitted).
     To rule on a Batson objection based on a prospective juror’s demeanor during
voir dire, it is not necessary that the ruling judge have observed the juror person-
ally. That a judge who observed a prospective juror should take those observations
into account, among other things, does not mean that a demeanor-based explana-
tion for a strike must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot recall the
juror’s demeanor. Thaler v. Haynes, 559 U.S. ___, No. 09–273, slip op. (2010).
     1678 Federal courts are especially deferential to state court decisions on discrimi-

natory intent when conducting federal habeas review. Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U.S.

     1679 Snyder v. Louisiana, 128 S. Ct. 1203, 1207 (2008) (Supreme Court found

prosecution’s race-neutral explanation for its peremptory challenge of a black juror
to be implausible, and found explanation’s “implausibility . . . reinforced by prosecu-
tion’s acceptance of white jurors” whom prosecution could have challenged for the
same reason that it claimed to have challenged the black juror, id. at 1211). In Miller-El
v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231 (2005), the Court found discrimination in the use of peremp-
tory strikes based on numerous factors, including the high ratio of minorities struck
from the venire panel (of 20 blacks, nine were excused for cause and ten were pe-
remptorily struck). Other factors the Court considered were the fact that the race-
neutral reasons given for the peremptory strikes of black panelists “appeared equally
on point as to some white jurors who served,” id. at 241; the prosecution used “jury
shuffling” (rearranging the order of panel members to be seated and questioned) twice
when blacks were at the front of the line; the prosecutor asked different questions
of black and white panel members; and there was evidence of a long-standing policy
of excluding blacks from juries.
