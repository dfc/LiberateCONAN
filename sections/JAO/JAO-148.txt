erty interest at will.791 A striking application of this analysis is found
in Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 792 in which a state anti-
discrimination law required the enforcing agency to convene a fact-
finding conference within 120 days of the filing of the complaint.
Inadvertently, the Commission scheduled the hearing after the ex-
piration of the 120 days and the state courts held the requirement
to be jurisdictional, necessitating dismissal of the complaint. The
Court noted that various older cases had clearly established that
causes of action were property, and, in any event, Logan’s claim was
an entitlement grounded in state law and thus could only be re-
moved “for cause.” This property interest existed independently of
the 120-day time period and could not simply be taken away by
agency action or inaction.793
    The Liberty Interest.—With respect to liberty interests, the Court
has followed a similarly meandering path. Although the traditional
concept of liberty was freedom from physical restraint, the Court
has expanded the concept to include various other protected inter-
ests, some statutorily created and some not.794 Thus, in Ingraham
v. Wright,795 the Court unanimously agreed that school children had
a liberty interest in freedom from wrongfully or excessively admin-
istered corporal punishment, whether or not such interest was pro-
tected by statute. “The liberty preserved from deprivation without
due process included the right ‘generally to enjoy those privileges
long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit
of happiness by free men.’ . . . Among the historic liberties so pro-
tected was a right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief for,
unjustified intrusions on personal security.” 796

     791 Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491 (1980). See also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985).
     792 455 U.S. 422 (1982).
     793 455 U.S. at 428–33 A different majority of the Court also found an equal

protection denial. 455 U.S. at 438.
     794 These procedural liberty interests should not, however, be confused with sub-

stantive liberty interests, which, if not outweighed by a sufficient governmental in-
terest, may not be intruded upon regardless of the process followed. See “Fundamen-
tal Rights (Noneconomic Due Process),” supra.
     795 430 U.S. 651 (1977).
     796 430 U.S. at 673. The family-related liberties discussed under substantive due

process, as well as the associational and privacy ones, no doubt provide a fertile
source of liberty interests for procedural protection. See Armstrong v. Manzo, 380
U.S. 545 (1965) (natural father, with visitation rights, must be given notice and op-
portunity to be heard with respect to impending adoption proceedings); Stanley v.
Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) (unwed father could not simply be presumed unfit to
have custody of his children because his interest in his children warrants deference
and protection). See also Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816
(1977); Little v. Streater, 452 U.S. 1 (1981); Lassiter v. Department of Social Ser-
vices, 452 U.S. 18 (1981); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982).
