because the scheme was surrounded with extensive security protec-
tion against disclosure beyond that necessary to achieve the pur-
poses of the program it was not thought to “pose a sufficiently griev-
ous threat to either interest to establish a constitutional violation.” 635
Lower court cases have raised substantial questions as to whether
this case established a “fundamental right” to informational pri-
vacy, and instead found that some as yet unspecified balancing test
or intermediate level of scrutiny was at play.636
    More than two decades after Whalen, the Court remains ambiva-
lent about whether such a privacy right exists, but seems to have
settled on a context-specific standard of reasonableness to evaluate
such claims. In Nasa v. Nelson 637 the Court considered whether gov-
ernment contractors working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
could be required as part of a background investigation to fill out
questionnaires regarding, among other topics, illegal drug use or
treatment thereof, and to have personal references queried as to
any adverse information going to honesty or trustworthiness. Over
a vigorous dissent, the Court presumed without deciding that the
government actions implicated a privacy interest of constitutional
significance,638 but then, considering that the employees in ques-
tion were working in a federal facility and that the background check
was the same as was used for federal employees, the Court upheld
the questions as “reasonable, employment related” inquiries.639
    The Court has also briefly considered yet another aspect of pri-
vacy—the idea that certain personal activities that were otherwise
unprotected could obtain some level of constitutional protection by
being performed in particular private locations, such as the home.
In Stanley v. Georgia,640 the Court held that the government may
not make private possession of obscene materials for private use a
crime. Normally, investigation and apprehension of an individual
      635 429 U.S. at 598–604. The Court cautioned that it had decided nothing about

the privacy implications of the accumulation and disclosure of vast amounts of infor-
mation in data banks. Safeguarding such information from disclosure “arguably has
its roots in the Constitution,” at least “in some circumstances,” the Court seemed to
indicate. Id. at 605. Compare id. at 606 (Justice Brennan concurring). What the Court’s
careful circumscription of the privacy issue through balancing does to the concept is
unclear after Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 455–65 (1977)
(stating that an invasion of privacy claim “cannot be considered in abstract [and]
. . . must be weighed against the public interest”). But see id. at 504, 525–36 (Chief
Justice Burger dissenting), and 545 n.1 (Justice Rehnquist dissenting).
      636 See, e.g., Plante v. Gonzalez, 575 F.2d 1119, 1134 (5th Cir. 1978) (“. . . we

believe that the balancing test, more common to due process claims, is appropriate
here.”).
