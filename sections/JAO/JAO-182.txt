     By virtue of its plenary power to prescribe the character of the
sentence which shall be awarded against those found guilty of crime,
a state may provide that a public officer embezzling public money
shall, notwithstanding that he has made restitution, suffer not only
imprisonment but also pay a fine equal to double the amount em-
bezzled, which shall operate as a judgment for the use of persons
whose money was embezzled. Whatever this fine is called, whether
a penalty, or punishment, or civil judgment, it comes to the convict
as the result of his crime.970 On the other hand, when appellant,
by its refusal to surrender certain assets, was adjudged in con-
tempt for frustrating enforcement of a judgment obtained against
it, dismissal of its appeal from the first judgment was not a pen-
alty imposed for the contempt, but merely a reasonable method for
sustaining the effectiveness of the state’s judicial process.971
     To deter careless destruction of human life, a state may allow
punitive damages to be assessed in actions against employers for
deaths caused by the negligence of their employees,972 and may also
allow punitive damages for fraud perpetrated by employees.973 Also
constitutional is the traditional common law approach for measur-
ing punitive damages, granting the jury wide but not unlimited dis-
cretion to consider the gravity of the offense and the need to deter
similar offenses.974 The Court has indicated, however, that, al-
though the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment “does
not apply to awards of punitive damages in cases between private
parties,” 975 a “grossly excessive” award of punitive damages vio-
lates substantive due process, as the Due Process Clause limits the
amount of punitive damages to what is “reasonably necessary to
vindicate the State’s legitimate interests in punishment and deter-
rence.” 976 These limits may be discerned by a court by examining
the degree of reprehensibility of the act, the ratio between the pu-
