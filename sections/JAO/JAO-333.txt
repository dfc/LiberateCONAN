and that, whatever it may stand for doctrinally, a sufficiently simi-
lar factual situation calling for application of its standards is un-
likely to arise.
     Sex.—Shortly after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the refusal of Illinois to license a woman to practice law was chal-
lenged before the Supreme Court, and the Court rejected the chal-
lenge in tones that prevailed well into the twentieth century. “The
civil law, as well as nature itself, has always recognized a wide dif-
ference in the respective spheres and destinies of man and woman.
Man is, or should be, woman’s protector and defender. The natural
and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex
evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life. The con-
stitution of the family organization, which is founded in the divine
ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domes-
tic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and func-
tions of womanhood.” 1795 On the same premise, a statute restrict-
ing the franchise to men was sustained.1796
    The greater number of cases have involved legislation aimed to
protect women from oppressive working conditions, as by prescrib-
ing maximum hours 1797 or minimum wages 1798 or by restricting some
of the things women could be required to do.1799 A 1961 decision
upheld a state law that required jury service of men but that gave
women the option of serving or not. “We cannot say that it is con-
stitutionally impermissible for a State acting in pursuit of the gen-
     1795 Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130, 141 (1873). The cases involving

alleged discrimination against women contain large numbers of quaint quotations
from unlikely sources. Upholding a law which imposed a fee upon all persons en-
gaged in the laundry business, but excepting businesses employing not more than
two women, Justice Holmes said: “If Montana deems it advisable to put a lighter
burden upon women than upon men with regard to an employment that our people
commonly regard as more appropriate for the former, the Fourteenth Amendment
does not interfere by creating a fictitious equality where there is a real difference.”
Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U.S. 59, 63 (1912). And upholding a law prohibiting
most women from tending bar, Justice Frankfurter said: “The fact that women may
now have achieved the virtues that men have long claimed as their prerogatives
and now indulge in vices that men have long practiced, does not preclude the States
from drawing a sharp line between the sexes, certainly in such matters as the regu-
lation of the liquor traffic. . . . The Constitution does not require legislatures to re-
flect sociological insight, or shifting social standards, any more than it requires them
to keep abreast of the latest scientific standards.” Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464,
466 (1948).
     1796 Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. (21 Wall) 162 (1875) (privileges and immuni-

ties).
     1797 Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908); Dominion Hotel v. Arizona, 249 U.S.

265 (1919).
     1798 West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937).
     1799 E.g., Radice v. New York, 264 U.S. 292 (1924) (prohibiting night work by

women in restaurants). A similar restriction set a maximum weight that women could
be required to lift.
