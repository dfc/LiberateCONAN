       interests, such as education,2059 the case remains strongly viable.
       Relying on Rodriguez and distinguishing Plyler, the Court in Kadrmas
       v. Dickinson Public Schools 2060 rejected an indigent student’s equal
       protection challenge to a state statute permitting school districts to
       charge a fee for school bus service, in the process rejecting argu-
       ments that either “strict” or “heightened” scrutiny is appropriate.
       Moreover, the Court concluded, there is no constitutional obligation
       to provide bus transportation, or to provide it for free if it is pro-
       vided at all.2061
            Abortion.—Rodriguez furnished the principal analytical basis
       for the Court’s subsequent decision in Maher v. Roe,2062 holding that
       a state’s refusal to provide public assistance for abortions that were
       not medically necessary under a program that subsidized all medi-
       cal expenses otherwise associated with pregnancy and childbirth did
       not deny to indigent pregnant women equal protection of the laws.
       As in Rodriguez, the Court held that the indigent are not a suspect
       class.2063 Again, as in Rodriguez and in Kras, the Court held that,
       when the state has not monopolized the avenues for relief and the
       burden is only relative rather than absolute, a governmental fail-
       ure to offer assistance, while funding alternative actions, is not un-
       due governmental interference with a fundamental right.2064 Expan-
       sion of this area of the law of equal protection seems especially limited.

    SECTION 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the
several States according to their respective numbers, counting
the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians
not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the
            2059 Cf. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). The case is also noted for its proposi-

       tion that there were only two equal protection standards of review, a proposition
       even the author of the opinion has now abandoned.
            2060 487 U.S. 450 (1988). This was a 5–4 decision, with Justice O’Connor’s opin-

       ion of the Court being joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Scalia,
       and Kennedy, and with Justices Marshall, Brennan, Stevens, and Blackmun dissent-
       ing.
            2061 487 U.S. at 462. The plaintiff child nonetheless continued to attend school,

       so the requirement was reviewed as an additional burden but not a complete ob-
       stacle to her education.
            2062 432 U.S. 464 (1977).
            2063 432 U.S. at 470–71.
            2064 432 U.S. at 471–74. See also Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 322–23 (1980).

       Total deprivation was the theme of Boddie and was the basis of concurrences by
       Justices Stewart and Powell in Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 391, 396 (1978),
       in that the State imposed a condition indigents could not meet and made no excep-
       tion for them. The case also emphasized that Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471
       (1970), imposed a rational basis standard in equal protection challenges to social
       welfare cases. But see Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), where the majority
       rejected the dissent’s argument that this should always be the same.
