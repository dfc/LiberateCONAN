lated to that interest.576 But a clause making the performance of
an abortion a crime except when it is based upon the doctor’s “best
clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary” was upheld against
vagueness attack and was further held to benefit women seeking
abortions on the grounds that the doctor could use his best clinical
judgment in light of all the attendant circumstances.577
    After Roe, various states attempted to limit access to this newly
found right, such as by requiring spousal or parental consent to ob-
tain an abortion.578 The Court, however, held that (1) requiring spou-
sal consent was an attempt by the state to delegate a veto power
over the decision of the woman and her doctor that the state itself
could not exercise,579 (2) that no significant state interests justified
the imposition of a blanket parental consent requirement as a con-
dition of the obtaining of an abortion by an unmarried minor dur-
ing the first 12 weeks of pregnancy,580 and (3) that a criminal pro-

violating the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, § 2. Id. at 200. See analy-

of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age—
relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.” Id.
at 192. Presumably this discussion applies to the Court’s holding in Roe that even
in the third trimester the woman may not be forbidden to have an abortion if it is
necessary to preserve her health as well as her life, 410 U.S. at 163–64, a holding
that is unelaborated in the opinion. See also United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62
(1971).

     579 Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 67–72 (1976). The Court rec-

ognized the husband’s interests and the state interest in promoting marital har-
mony. But the latter was deemed not served by the requirement, and, since when
the spouses disagree on the abortion decision one has to prevail, the Court thought
the person who bears the child and who is the more directly affected should be the
one to prevail. Justices White and Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger dissented.
Id. at 92.
     580 428 U.S. at 72–75. Minors have rights protected by the Constitution, but the

states have broader authority to regulate their activities than those of adults. Here,
the Court perceived no state interest served by the requirement that overcomes the
woman’s right to make her own decision; it emphasized that it was not holding that
every minor, regardless of age or maturity, could give effective consent for an abor-
tion. Justice Stevens joined the other dissenters on this part of the holding. Id. at
101. In Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622 (1979), eight Justices agreed that a parental
consent law, applied to a mature minor found to be capable of making, and having
made, an informed and reasonable decision to have an abortion, was void but split
on the reasoning. Four Justices would hold that neither parents nor a court could
be given an absolute veto over a mature minor’s decision, while four others would
