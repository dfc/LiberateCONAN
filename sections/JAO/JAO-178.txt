    The use of mail to convey notice, for instance, has become quite
established,947 especially for assertion of in personam jurisdiction
extraterritorially upon individuals and corporations having “mini-
mum contacts” with a forum state, where various “long-arm” stat-
utes authorize notice by mail.948 Or, in a class action, due process
is satisfied by mail notification of out-of-state class members, giv-
ing such members the opportunity to “opt out” but with no require-
ment that inclusion in the class be contingent upon affirmative re-
sponse.949 Other service devices and substitutions have been pursued
and show some promise of further loosening of the concept of terri-
toriality even while complying with minimum due process stan-
dards of notice.950

Power of the States to Regulate Procedure
    Generally.—As long as a party has been given sufficient notice
and an opportunity to defend his interest, the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment does not generally mandate the par-
ticular forms of procedure to be used in state courts.951 The states
may regulate the manner in which rights may be enforced and wrongs

that notices posted on the doors of apartments in a housing project in an eviction
proceeding were often torn down by children and others before tenants ever saw
them, service by posting did not satisfy due process. Without requiring service by
mail, the Court observed that the mails “provide an ‘efficient and inexpensive means
of communication’ upon which prudent men will ordinarily rely in the conduct of
important affairs.” Id. at 455 (citations omitted). See also Mennonite Bd. of Missions

New Jersey’s “long-arm” rule, under which a plaintiff must make every effort to serve
process upon someone within the state and then, only if “after diligent inquiry and
effort personal service cannot be made” within the state, “service may be made by
mailing, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the sum-
mons and complaint to a registered agent for service, or to its principal place of
business, or to its registered office.”). Cf. Velmohos v. Maren Engineering Corp., 83

in accordance with it own conception of policy and fairness unless in so doing it
offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our
people as to be ranked as fundamental.” Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105
