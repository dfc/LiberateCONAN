    Early Limitations on Review.—Even while reviewing the rea-
sonableness of rates, the Court recognized some limits on judicial
review. As early as 1894, the Court asserted that “[t]he courts are
not authorized to revise or change the body of rates imposed by a
legislature or a commission; they do not determine whether one rate
is preferable to another, or what under all circumstances would be
fair and reasonable as between the carriers and the shippers; they
do not engage in any mere administrative work; but still there can
be no doubt of their power and duty to inquire whether a body of
rates . . . is unjust and unreasonable, . . . and if found so to be, to
restrain its operation.” 165 One can also infer from these early hold-
ings a distinction between unreviewable fact questions that relate
only to the wisdom or expediency of a rate order, and reviewable
factual determinations that bear on a commission’s power to act.166
    Further, the Court placed various obstacles in the path of the
complaining litigant. Thus, not only must a person challenging a
rate assume the burden of proof,167 but he must present a case of
“manifest constitutional invalidity.” 168 And, if, notwithstanding this
effort, the question of confiscation remains in doubt, no relief will
be granted.169 Moreover, even the Court was inclined to withhold
judgment on the application of a rate until its practical effect could
be surmised.170
     In the course of time this distinction solidified. Thus, the Court
initially adopted the position that it would not disturb findings of
     165 Reagan v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 362, 397 (1894). And later,

in 1910, the Court made a similar observation that courts may not, “under the guise
of exerting judicial power, usurp merely administrative functions by setting aside”
an order of the commission merely because such power was unwisely or expediently
exercised. ICC v. Illinois Cent. R.R., 215 U.S. 452, 470 (1910). This statement, made
in the context of federal ratemaking, appears to be equally applicable to judicial
review of state agency actions.
     166 This distinction was accorded adequate emphasis by the Court in Louisville

& Nashville R.R. v. Garrett, 231 U.S. 298, 310–13 (1913), in which it declared that
“the appropriate question for the courts” is simply whether a “commission,” in estab-
lishing a rate, “acted within the scope of its power” and did not violate “constitu-
tional rights . . . by imposing confiscatory requirements.” The carrier contesting the
rate was not entitled to have a court also pass upon a question of fact regarding the
reasonableness of a higher rate the carrier charged prior to the order of the commis-
sion. All that need concern a court, it said, is the fairness of the proceeding whereby
the commission determined that the existing rate was excessive, but not the expedi-
ency or wisdom of the commission’s having superseded that rate with a rate regula-
tion of its own.
     167 Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U.S. 153 (1915).
     168 Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), 230 U.S. 352, 452 (1913).
     169 Knoxville v. Water Co., 212 U.S. 1 (1909).
     170 Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U.S. 19 (1909). However, a public util-

ity that has petitioned a commission for relief from allegedly confiscatory rates need
not await indefinitely for the commission’s decision before applying to a court for
equitable relief. Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 270 U.S. 587 (1926).
