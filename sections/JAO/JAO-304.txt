branch.” 1643 Following 1954, segregated schools continued to exist
and the school boards had in fact taken actions which had the ef-
fect of increasing segregation. In the context of the on-going affir-
mative duty to desegregate, the foreseeable impact of the actions of
the boards could be used to infer segregative intent, thus satisfy-
ing the Davis-Arlington Heights standards.1644 The Court further
affirmed the district-wide remedies, holding that its earlier Dayton
ruling had been premised upon the evidence of only a few isolated
discriminatory practices; here, because systemwide impact had been
found, systemwide remedies were appropriate.1645
    Reaffirmation of the breadth of federal judicial remedial pow-
ers came when, in a second appeal of the Detroit case, the Court
unanimously upheld the order of a district court mandating compen-
satory or remedial educational programs for school children who had
been subjected to past acts of de jure segregation. So long as the
remedy is related to the condition found to violate the Constitu-
tion, so long as it is remedial, and so long as it takes into account
the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own
affairs, federal courts have broad and flexible powers to remedy past
wrongs.1646
     The broad scope of federal courts’ remedial powers was more
recently reaffirmed in Missouri v. Jenkins.1647 There the Court ruled
that a federal district court has the power to order local authorities
to impose a tax increase in order to pay to remedy a constitutional
violation, and if necessary may enjoin operation of state laws pro-
hibiting such tax increases. However, the Court also held, the dis-
trict court had abused its discretion by itself imposing an increase

v. School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437–38 (1968)). Contrast the Court’s
more recent decision in Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986) (per curiam), hold-
ing that adoption of “a wholly neutral admissions policy” for voluntary membership
in state-sponsored 4–H Clubs was sufficient even though single race clubs continued
to exist under that policy. There is no constitutional requirement that states in all
circumstances pursue affirmative remedies to overcome past discrimination, the Court
concluded; the voluntary nature of the clubs, unrestricted by state definition of at-
tendance zones or other decisions affecting membership, presented a “wholly differ-
ent milieu” from public schools. Id. at 408 (concurring opinion of Justice White, en-
dorsed by the Court’s per curiam opinion).
