anteeing a formal, adversarial probable cause hearing within that
period, was found to satisfy these requirements.
    Each state has a procedure by which juveniles may be tried as
adults.1253 With the Court having clarified the constitutional require-
ments for imposition of capital punishment, it was only a matter of
time before the Court would have to determine whether states may
subject juveniles to capital punishment. In Stanford v. Ken-
tucky,1254 the Court held that the Eighth Amendment does not cat-
egorically prohibit imposition of the death penalty for individuals
who commit crimes at age 16 or 17; earlier the Court had invali-
dated a statutory scheme permitting capital punishment for crimes
committed before age 16.1255 In weighing validity under the Eighth
Amendment, the Court has looked to state practice to determine
whether a consensus against execution exists.1256 Still to be consid-
ered by the Court are such questions as the substantive and proce-
dural guarantees to be applied in proceedings when the matter at
issue is non-criminal delinquent behavior.
    The Problem of Civil Commitment.—As with juvenile offend-
ers, several other classes of persons are subject to confinement by
court processes deemed civil rather than criminal. Within this cat-
egory of “protective commitment” are involuntary commitments for
treatment of insanity and other degrees of mental disability, alco-
holism, narcotics addiction, sexual psychopathy, and the like. In
O’Connor v. Donaldson,1257 the Court held that “a State cannot con-
stitutionally confine without more a nondangerous individual who
is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help
of willing and responsible family members or friends.” 1258 The jury
had found that Donaldson was not dangerous to himself or to oth-
ers, and the Court ruled that he had been unconstitutionally con-

treatment of the involuntarily committed, discussed under “Liberty Interests of People
with Mental Disabilities: Commitment and Treatment,” supra.

Pearson v. Probate Court, 309 U.S. 270 (1940), had the Court considered the issue.
Other cases reflected the Court’s concern with the rights of convicted criminal defen-
dants and generally required due process procedures or that the commitment of con-
victed criminal defendants follow the procedures required for civil commitments. Specht
