    Congress’s authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment
to abrogate states’ Eleventh Amendment immunity is strongest when
a state’s conduct at issue in a case is alleged to have actually vio-
lated a constitutional right. In United States v. Georgia,2161 a dis-
abled state prison inmate who used a wheelchair for mobility al-
leged that his treatment by the State of Georgia and the conditions
of his confinement violated, among other things, Title II of the ADA
and the Eighth Amendment (as incorporated by the Fourteenth
Amendment). A unanimous Court found that, to the extent that the
prisoner’s claims under Title II for money damages were based on
conduct that independently violated the provisions of the Four-
teenth Amendment, they could be applied against the state. In do-
ing so, the Court declined to apply the congruent and proportional
response test, distinguishing the cases applying that standard (dis-
cussed above) as not generally involving allegations of direct consti-
tutional violations.2162




     2160 541 U.S. at 524–25. Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, disputed the reliance of

the Congress on evidence of disability discrimination in the provision of services ad-
ministered by local, not state, governments, as local entities do not enjoy the protec-
tions of sovereign immunity. Id. at 542–43. The majority, in response, noted that
local courts are generally treated as arms of the state for sovereign immunity pur-
poses, Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977), and that
the action of non-state actors had previously been considered in such pre-Boerne cases
as South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 312–15 (1966).

     2162 “While the Members of this Court have disagreed regarding the scope of

Congress’s ‘prophylactic’ enforcement powers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment, no one doubts that § 5 grants Congress the power to ‘enforce . . . the provi-
sions’ of the Amendment by creating private remedies against the States for actual
violations of those provisions.” 546 U.S. at 158 (citations omitted).
