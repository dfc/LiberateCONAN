    In FCC v. Fox, 567 U.S. ___, No. 10–1293, slip op. (2012) the
Court held that the Federal Communiations Commission (FCC) had
violated the Fifth Amendment due process rights of Fox Television
and ABC, Inc., because the FCC had not given fair notice that broad-
casting isolated instances of expletives or brief nudity could lead to
punishment. 18 U.S.C. § 1464 bans the broadcast of “any obscene,
indecent, or profane language”, but the FCC had a long-standing
policy that it would not consider “fleeting” instances of indecency
to be actionable, and had confirmed such a policy by issuance of an
industry guidance. The policy was not announced until after the in-
stances at issues in this case (two concerned isolated utterances of
expletives during two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television, and
a brief exposure of the nude buttocks of an adult female character
by ABC). The Commission policy in place at the time of the broad-
casts, therefore, gave the broadcasters no notice that a fleeting in-
stance of indecency could be actionable as indecent.
    On the other hand, some less vague statutes may be held un-
constitutional only in application to the defendant before the Court.1036
For instance, where the terms of a statute could be applied both to
innocent or protected conduct (such as free speech) and unpro-
tected conduct, but the valuable effects of the law outweigh its po-
tential general harm, such a statute will be held unconstitutional
only as applied.1037 Thus, in Palmer v. City of Euclid,1038 an ordi-
nance punishing “suspicious persons” defined as “[a]ny person who
wanders about the streets or other public ways or who is found abroad
at late or unusual hours in the night without any visible or lawful
business and who does not give satisfactory account of himself ” was
found void only as applied to a particular defendant. In Palmer, the
Court found that the defendant, having dropped off a passenger and
begun talking into a two-way radio, was engaging in conduct which
could not reasonably be anticipated as fitting within the “without
any visible or lawful business” portion of the ordinance’s definition.
    Loitering statutes that are triggered by failure to obey a police
dispersal order are suspect, and may be struck down if they leave
a police officer absolute discretion to give such orders.1039 Thus, a
Chicago ordinance that required police to disperse all persons in
     1036 Where the terms of a vague statute do not threaten a constitutionally pro-

tected right, and where the conduct at issue in a particular case is clearly pro-
scribed, then a due process challenge is unlikely to be successful. Where the con-
duct in question is at the margins of the meaning of an unclear statute, however, it
will be struck down as applied. E.g., United States v. National Dairy Corp., 372 U.S.
29 (1963).
     1037 Palmer v. City of Euclid, 402 U.S. 544 (1971); Village of Hoffman Estates v.

The Flipside, 455 U.S. 489, 494–95 (1982).
     1038 402 U.S. 544 (1971).
     1039 Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 (1983).
