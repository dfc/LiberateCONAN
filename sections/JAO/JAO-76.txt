     The authority of states to tax income is “universally recog-
nized.” 394 Years ago the Court explained that “[e]njoyment of the
privileges of residence in the state and the attendant right to in-
voke the protection of its laws are inseparable from responsibility
for sharing the costs of government. . . . A tax measured by the net
income of residents is an equitable method of distributing the bur-
dens of government among those who are privileged to enjoy its ben-
efits.” 395 Also, a tax on income is not constitutionally suspect be-
cause retroactive. The routine practice of making taxes retroactive
for the entire year of the legislative session in which the tax is en-
acted has long been upheld,396 and there are also situations in which
courts have upheld retroactive application to the preceding year or
two.397
    A state also has broad tax authority over wills and inheritance.
A state may apply an inheritance tax to the transmission of prop-
erty by will or descent, or to the legal privilege of taking property
by devise or descent,398 although such tax must be consistent with
other due process considerations.399 Thus, an inheritance tax law,
enacted after the death of a testator but before the distribution of

That payment may be made to private individuals is now irrelevant. Carmichael,
301 U.S. at 518. Cf. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1 (1976) (sustain-
ing tax imposed on mine companies to compensate workers for black lung disabili-
ties, including those contracting disease before enactment of tax, as way of spread-
ing cost of employee liabilities).

nonresidents derived from property or activity within the state).

     397 Welch v. Henry, 305 U.S. 134 (1938) (upholding imposition in 1935 of tax

liability for 1933 tax year; due to the scheduling of legislative sessions, this was the
legislature’s first opportunity to adjust revenues after obtaining information of the
nature and amount of the income generated by the original tax). Because “[t]axa-
tion is neither a penalty imposed on the taxpayer nor a liability which he assumes
by contract,” the Court explained, “its retroactive imposition does not necessarily
infringe due process.” Id. at 146–47.
     398 Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U.S. 137, 140, 141 (1925).
     399 When remainders indisputably vest at the time of the creation of a trust

and a succession tax is enacted thereafter, the imposition of the tax on the transfer
of such remainder is unconstitutional. Coolidge v. Long, 282 U.S. 582 (1931). The
Court has noted that insofar as retroactive taxation of vested gifts has been voided,
the justification therefor has been that “the nature or amount of the tax could not
reasonably have been anticipated by the taxpayer at the time of the particular vol-
untary act which the [retroactive] statute later made the taxable event . . . . Taxa-
tion . . . of a gift which . . . [the donor] might well have refrained from making had
he anticipated the tax . . . [is] thought to be so arbitrary . . . as to be a denial of
due process.” Welch v. Henry, 305 U.S. 134, 147 (1938). But where the remaindermen’s
interests are contingent and do not vest until the donor’s death subsequent to the
adoption of the statute, the tax is valid. Stebbins v. Riley, 268 U.S. 137 (1925).
