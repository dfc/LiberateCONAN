More recently, the Court has attempted to clarify these cases by
distinguishing situations where a state citizen is likely to “con-
sume” benefits within a state’s borders (such as the provision of wel-
fare) from those where citizens of other states are likely to estab-
lish residency just long enough to acquire some portable benefit,
and then return to their original domicile to enjoy them (such as
obtaining a divorce decree or paying the in-state tuition rate for a
college education).1989
    A state scheme for returning to its residents a portion of the
income earned from the vast oil deposits discovered within Alaska
foundered upon the formula for allocating the dividends; that is,
each adult resident received one unit of return for each year of resi-
dency subsequent to 1959, the first year of Alaska’s statehood. The
law thus created fixed, permanent distinctions between an ever-
increasing number of classes of bona fide residents based on how
long they had been in the state. The differences between the durational
residency cases previously decided did not alter the bearing of the
right to travel principle upon the distribution scheme, but the Court’s
decision went off on the absence of any permissible purpose under-
lying the apportionment classification and it thus failed even the
rational basis test.1990
    Still unresolved are issues such as durational residency require-
ments for occupational licenses and other purposes.1991 But this line
of cases does not apply to state residency requirements themselves,
as distinguished from durational provisions,1992 and the cases do
not inhibit the states when, having reasons for doing so, they bar
travel by certain persons.1993


    1989  Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. at 505.
    1990  Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55 (1982). Somewhat similar was the Court’s
invalidation on equal protection grounds of a veterans preference for state employ-
ment limited to persons who were state residents when they entered military ser-
vice; four Justices also thought the preference penalized the right to travel. Attor-
ney General of New York v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898 (1986).
     1991 La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U.S. 465 (1919), upholding a two-year resi-

dence requirement to become an insurance broker, must be considered of question-
able validity. Durational periods for admission to the practice of law or medicine or
other professions have evoked differing responses by lower courts.
     1992 E.g., McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Service Comm’n, 424 U.S. 645 (1976)

(ordinance requiring city employees to be and to remain city residents upheld). See
Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 255 (1974). See also Martinez
v. Bynum, 461 U.S. 321 (1983) (bona fide residency requirement for free tuition to
public schools).
     1993 Jones v. Helms, 452 U.S. 412 (1981) (statute made it a misdemeanor to aban-

don a dependent child but a felony to commit the offense and then leave the state).
