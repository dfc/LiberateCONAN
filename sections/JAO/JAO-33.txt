late due process.122 Likewise, an act that allowed an injured employee,
though guilty of contributory negligence, an election of remedies be-
tween restricted recovery under a compensation law or full compen-
satory damages under the Employers’ Liability Act, did not deprive
an employer of his property without due process of law.123 A vari-
ety of other statutory schemes have also been upheld.124
    Even the imposition upon coal mine operators of the liability of
compensating former employees who terminated work in the indus-
try before passage of the law for black lung disabilities was sus-
tained by the Court as a rational measure to spread the costs of
the employees’ disabilities to those who have profited from the fruits
of their labor.125 Legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not
unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations, but
it must take account of the realities previously existing, i.e., that
the danger may not have been known or appreciated, or that ac-
tions might have been taken in reliance upon the current state of
the law. Consequently, legislation imposing liability on the basis of
deterrence or of blameworthiness might not have passed muster.
