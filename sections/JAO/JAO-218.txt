    Sentencing.—In the absence of errors by the sentencing judge,1161
or of sentencing jurors considering invalid factors,1162 the signifi-
cance of procedural due process at sentencing is limited.1163 In Wil-
liams v. New York,1164 the Court upheld the imposition of the death
penalty, despite a jury’s recommendation of mercy, where the judge
acted based on information in a presentence report not shown to
the defendant or his counsel. The Court viewed as highly undesir-
able the restriction of judicial discretion in sentencing by requiring
adherence to rules of evidence which would exclude highly relevant
and informative material. Further, disclosure of such information
to the defense could well dry up sources who feared retribution or
embarrassment. Thus, hearsay and rumors can be considered in sen-
tencing. In Gardner v. Florida,1165 however, the Court limited the
application of Williams to capital cases.1166

     1161 In Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 740–41 (1948) the Court overturned a

sentence imposed on an uncounseled defendant by a judge who in reciting defen-
dant’s record from the bench made several errors and facetious comments. “[W]hile
disadvantaged by lack of counsel, this prisoner was sentenced on the basis of assump-
tions concerning his criminal record which were materially untrue. Such a result,
whether caused by carelessness or design, is inconsistent with due process of law,
and such a conviction cannot stand.”
     1162 In Hicks v. Oklahoma, 447 U.S. 343 (1980), the jury had been charged in

accordance with a habitual offender statute that if it found defendant guilty of the
offense charged, which would be a third felony conviction, it should assess punish-
ment at 40 years imprisonment. The jury convicted and gave defendant 40 years.
Subsequently, in another case, the habitual offender statute under which Hicks had
been sentenced was declared unconstitutional, but Hicks’ conviction was affirmed on
the basis that his sentence was still within the permissible range open to the jury.
The Supreme Court reversed. Hicks was denied due process because he was statuto-
rily entitled to the exercise of the jury’s discretion and could have been given a sen-
tence as low as ten years. That the jury might still have given the stiffer sentence
was only conjectural. On other due process restrictions on the determination of the
applicability of recidivist statutes to convicted defendants, see Chewning v. Cun-
ningham, 368 U.S. 443 (1962); Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448 (1962); Spencer v. Texas,
385 U.S. 554 (1967); Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20 (1992).
     1163 Due process does not impose any limitation upon the sentence that a legis-

lature may affix to any offense; that function is in the Eighth Amendment. Williams
v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576, 586–87 (1959). See also Collins v. Johnston, 237 U.S.
502 (1915). On recidivist statutes, see Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U.S. 616, 623
(1912); Ughbanks v. Armstrong, 208 U.S. 481, 488 (1908), and, under the Eighth
Amendment, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263 (1980).
     1164 337 U.S. 241 (1949). See also Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576 (1959).
     1165 430 U.S. 349 (1977).
     1166 In Gardner, the jury had recommended a life sentence upon convicting de-

fendant of murder, but the trial judge sentenced the defendant to death, relying in
part on a confidential presentence report which he did not characterize or make avail-
able to defense or prosecution. Justices Stevens, Stewart, and Powell found that be-
cause death was significantly different from other punishments and because sentenc-
ing procedures were subject to higher due process standards than when Williams
was decided, the report must be made part of the record for review so that the fac-
tors motivating imposition of the death penalty may be known, and ordinarily must
be made available to the defense. 430 U.S. at 357–61. All but one of the other Jus-
tices joined the result on various other bases. Justice Brennan without elaboration
