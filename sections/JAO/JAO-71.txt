manufactured or kept are common nuisances,355 and may even sub-
ject an innocent owner to the forfeiture of his property if he allows
others to use it for the illegal production or transportation of alco-

     Safety.—Regulations designed to promote public safety are also
well within a state’s authority. For instance, various measures de-
signed to reduce fire hazards have been upheld. These include mu-
nicipal ordinances that prohibit the storage of gasoline within 300
feet of any dwelling,357 require that all gas storage tanks with a
capacity of more than ten gallons be buried at least three feet un-
der ground,358 or prohibit washing and ironing in public laundries
and wash houses within defined territorial limits from 10 p.m. to 6
a.m.359 A city’s demolition and removal of wooden buildings erected
in violation of regulations was also consistent with the Fourteenth
Amendment.360 Construction of property in full compliance with ex-
isting laws, however, does not confer upon the owner an immunity
against exercise of the police power. Thus, a 1944 amendment to a
Multiple Dwelling Law, requiring installation of automatic sprin-
klers in lodging houses of non-fireproof construction, can be ap-
plied to a lodging house constructed in 1940, even though compli-
ance entails an expenditure of $7,500 on a property worth only
$25,000.361
     States exercise extensive regulation over transportation safety.
Although state highways are used primarily for private purposes,
they are public property, and the use of a highway for financial gain
may be prohibited by the legislature or conditioned as it sees fit.362
Consequently, a state may reasonably provide that intrastate carri-
ers who have furnished adequate, responsible, and continuous ser-
vice over a given route from a specified date in the past shall be
entitled to licenses as a matter of right, but that issuance to those
whose service began later shall depend upon public convenience and
necessity.363 A state may require private contract carriers for hire
to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity, and decline to
