erty in question.908 Proceedings brought to register title to land,909
to condemn 910 or confiscate 911 real or personal property, or to ad-
minister a decedent’s estate 912 are typical in rem actions. Due pro-
cess is satisfied by seizure of the property (the “res”) and notice to
all who have or may have interests therein.913 Under prior case law,
a court could acquire in rem jurisdiction over nonresidents by mere
constructive service of process,914 under the theory that property
was always in possession of its owners and that seizure would af-
ford them notice, because they would keep themselves apprized of
the state of their property. It was held, however, that this fiction
did not satisfy the requirements of due process, and, whatever the
nature of the proceeding, that notice must be given in a manner
that actually notifies the person being sought or that has a reason-
able certainty of resulting in such notice.915
    Although the Court has now held “that all assertions of state-
court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the [‘minimum con-
tacts’] standards set forth in International Shoe Co. v. Washing-
ton,” 916 it does not appear that this will appreciably change the result
for in rem jurisdiction over property. “[T]he presence of property in
a State may bear on the existence of jurisdiction by providing con-
tacts among the forum State, the defendant, and the litigation. For
example, when claims to the property itself are the source of the
underlying controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, it
would be unusual for the State where the property is located not to
have jurisdiction. In such cases, the defendant’s claim to property
located in the State would normally indicate that he expected to
benefit from the State’s protection of his interest. The State’s strong
interests in assuring the marketability of property within its bor-
ders and in providing a procedure for peaceful resolution of dis-
