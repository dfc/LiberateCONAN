Denckla.934 As discussed earlier,935 the decedent created a trust with
a Delaware corporation as trustee,936 and the Florida courts had
attempted to assert both in personam and in rem jurisdiction over
the Delaware corporation. Asserting the old theory that a court’s in
rem jurisdiction “is limited by the extent of its power and by the
coordinate authority of sister States,” 937 i.e., whether the court has
jurisdiction over the thing, the Court thought it clear that the trust
assets that were the subject of the suit were located in Delaware
and thus the Florida courts had no in rem jurisdiction. The Court
did not expressly consider whether the International Shoe test should
apply to such in rem jurisdiction, as it has now held it generally
must, but it did briefly consider whether Florida’s interests arising
from its authority to probate and construe the domiciliary’s will,
under which the foreign assets might pass, were a sufficient basis
of in rem jurisdiction and decided they were not.938 The effect of
International Shoe in this area is still to be discerned.
     The reasoning of the Pennoyer 939 rule, that seizure of property
and publication was sufficient to give notice to nonresidents or ab-
sent defendants, has also been applied in proceedings for the forfei-
ture of abandoned property. If all known claimants were personally
served and all claimants who were unknown or nonresident were
given constructive notice by publication, judgments in these proceed-
ings were held binding on all.940 But, in Mullane v. Central Hanover
Bank & Trust Co.,941 the Court, while declining to characterize the
proceeding as in rem or in personam, held that a bank managing a
common trust fund in favor of nonresident as well as resident ben-
eficiaries could not obtain a judicial settlement of accounts if the
only notice was publication in a local paper. Although such notice
by publication was sufficient as to beneficiaries whose interests or

tate, either by testamentary disposition or by inter vivos instrument. After she moved
to Florida, she executed a new will and a new power of appointment under the trust,
which did not satisfy the requirements for testamentary disposition under Florida
law. Upon her death, dispute arose as to whether the property passed pursuant to
the terms of the power of appointment or in accordance with the residuary clause of
the will.

and Douglas, believed that the transfer in Florida of $400,000 made by a domicili-
ary and affecting beneficiaries, almost all of whom lived in that state, gave rise to a
sufficient connection with Florida to support an adjudication by its courts of the ef-
fectiveness of the transfer. 357 U.S. at 256, 262.
