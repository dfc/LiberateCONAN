vating sentencing factors by judges when imposing capital punish-
ment.1123 These holdings are subject to at least one exception,
however,1124 and the decisions might be evaded by legislatures re-
vising criminal provisions to increase maximum penalties, and then
providing for mitigating factors within the newly established sen-
tencing range.
     Another closely related issue is statutory presumptions, where
proof of a “presumed fact” that is a required element of a crime, is
established by another fact, the “basic fact.” 1125 In Tot v. United
States,1126 the Court held that a statutory presumption was valid
under the Due Process Clause only if it met a “rational connection”
test. In that case, the Court struck down a presumption that a per-
son possessing an illegal firearm had shipped, transported, or re-
ceived such in interstate commerce. “Under our decisions, a statu-
tory presumption cannot be sustained if there be no rational connection
between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the in-
ference of the one from the proof of the other is arbitrary because
of lack of connection between the two in common experience.”
     In Leary v. United States,1127 this due process test was stiff-
ened to require that, for such a “rational connection” to exist, it must
“at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact
is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is
made to depend.” Thus, the Court voided a provision that permit-
ted a jury to infer from a defendant’s possession of marijuana his
knowledge of its illegal importation. A lengthy canvass of factual
materials established to the Court’s satisfaction that, although the
      1123 Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), overruled by Ring v. Arizona, 536

U.S. 584 (2002).
      1124 This limiting principle does not apply to sentencing enhancements based on

recidivism. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490. As enhancement of sentences for repeat of-
fenders is traditionally considered a part of sentencing, establishing the existence of
previous valid convictions may be made by a judge, despite its resulting in a signifi-
cant increase in the maximum sentence available. Almendarez-Torres v. United States,
523 U.S. 224 (1998) (deported alien reentering the United States subject to a maxi-
mum sentence of two years, but upon proof of felony record, is subject to a maxi-
mum of twenty years). See also Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20 (1992) (where prosecu-
tor has burden of establishing a prior conviction, a defendant can be required to
bear the burden of challenging the validity of such a conviction).
      1125 See, e.g., Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178 (1925) (upholding statute

that proscribed possession of smoking opium that had been illegally imported and
authorized jury to presume illegal importation from fact of possession); Manley v.
Georgia, 279 U.S. 1 (1929) (invalidating statutory presumption that every insol-
vency of a bank shall be deemed fraudulent).
      1126 319 U.S. 463, 467–68 (1943). Compare United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63

(1965) (upholding presumption from presence at site of illegal still that defendant
was “carrying on” or aiding in “carrying on” its operation), with United States v.
Romano, 382 U.S. 136 (1965) (voiding presumption from presence at site of illegal
still that defendant had possession, custody, or control of still).
      1127 395 U.S. 6, 36 (1969).
