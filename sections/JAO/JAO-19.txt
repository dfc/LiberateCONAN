The Rise and Fall of Economic Substantive Due Process:
 Overview
    Long before the passage of the 14th Amendment, the Due Pro-
cess Clause of the Fifth Amendment was recognized as a restraint
upon the Federal Government, but only in the narrow sense that a
legislature needed to provide procedural “due process” for the en-
forcement of law.60 Although individual Justices suggested early on
that particular legislation could be so in conflict with precepts of
natural law as to render it wholly unconstitutional,61 the potential
of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment as a substantive
restraint on state action appears to have been grossly underesti-
mated in the years immediately following its adoption.62
    Thus, early invocations of “substantive” due process were unsuc-
cessful. In the Slaughter-House Cases,63 discussed previously in the
context of the Privileges or Immunities Clause,64 a group of butch-
ers challenged a Louisiana statute conferring the exclusive privi-
lege of butchering cattle in New Orleans to one corporation. In re-
viewing the validity of this monopoly, the Court noted that the
due process-liberty analysis. Cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972). For
more recent cases, see DeShaney v. Winnebago County Social Servs. Dep’t, 489 U.S.
189 (1989) (no due process violation for failure of state to protect an abused child
from his parent, even though abuse had been detected by social service agency); Col-
lins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115 (1992) (failure of city to warn its employ-
ees about workplace hazards does not violate due process; the due process clause
does not impose a duty on the city to provide employees with a safe working envi-
ronment); County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998) (high-speed automo-
bile chase by police officer causing death through deliberate or reckless indifference
to life would not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of substantive due
process). But see Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760 (2003) (case remanded to federal
circuit court to determine whether coercive questioning of severely injured suspect
gave rise to a compensable violation of due process).
     60 The conspicuous exception to this was the holding in the Dred Scott case that

former slaves, as non-citizens, could not claim the protections of the clause. 60 U.S.
(19 How.) 393, 450 (1857).
     61 See, e.g., Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 388 (1798) (“An act of the legis-

lature (for I cannot call it a law), contrary to the first great principles of the social
compact, cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative authority”) (Chase,
J.).
     62 In the years following the ratification of the 14th Amendment, the Court of-

ten observed that the Due Process Clause “operates to extend . . . the same protec-
tion against arbitrary state legislation, affecting life, liberty and property, as is of-
fered by the Fifth Amendment,” Hibben v. Smith, 191 U.S. 310, 325 (1903), and that
“ordinarily if an act of Congress is valid under the Fifth Amendment it would be
hard to say that a state law in like terms was void under the Fourteenth,” Carroll
v. Greenwich Ins. Co., 199 U.S. 401, 410 (1905). See also French v. Barber Asphalt
Paving Co., 181 U.S. 324, 328 (1901). There is support for the notion, however, that
the proponents of the 14th Amendment envisioned a more expansive substantive
interpretation of that Amendment than had developed under the Fifth Amendment.
