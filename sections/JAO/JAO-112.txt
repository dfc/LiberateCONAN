    Webster, however, exposed a split in the Court’s approach to Roe
v. Wade. The plurality opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined
in that part by Justices White and Kennedy, was highly critical of
Roe, but found no occasion to overrule it. Instead, the plurality’s
approach sought to water down Roe by applying a less stringent
standard of review. For instance, the plurality found the viability
testing requirement valid because it “permissibly furthers the State’s
interest in protecting potential human life.” 595 Justice O’Connor, how-
ever, concurred in the result based on her view that the require-
ment did not impose “an undue burden” on a woman’s right to an
abortion, while Justice Scalia’s concurrence urged that Roe be over-
ruled outright. Thus, when a Court majority later invalidated a Min-
nesota procedure requiring notification of both parents without ju-
dicial bypass, it did so because it did “not reasonably further any
legitimate state interest.” 596
    Roe was not confronted more directly in Webster because the
viability testing requirement, as characterized by the plurality, merely
asserted a state interest in protecting potential human life after vi-
ability, and hence did not challenge Roe’s ‘trimester framework.597
Nonetheless, a majority of Justices appeared ready to reject a strict
trimester approach. The plurality asserted a compelling state inter-
est in protecting human life throughout pregnancy, rejecting the no-
tion that the state interest “should come into existence only at the
point of viability;” 598 Justice O’Connor repeated her view that the
trimester approach is “problematic;” 599 and, as mentioned, Justice
Scalia would have done away with Roe altogether.

497 U.S. 502 (1990). And, while the Court ruled that Minnesota’s requirement that
both parents be notified was invalid standing alone, the statute was saved by a ju-
dicial bypass alternative. Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417 (1990).
     595 492 U.S. at 519–20. Dissenting Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Bren-

nan and Marshall, argued that this “permissibly furthers” standard “completely dis-
regards the irreducible minimum of Roe . . . that a woman has a limited fundamen-
tal constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy,” and instead
balances “a lead weight” (the State’s interest in fetal life) against a “feather” (a wom-
an’s liberty interest). Id. at 555, 556 n.11.
     596 Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 450 (1990).
     597 492 U.S. at 521. Concurring Justice O’Connor agreed that “no decision of

this Court has held that the State may not directly promote its interest in potential
life when viability is possible.” Id. at 528.
     598 492 U.S. at 519.
     599 492 U.S. at 529. Previously, dissenting in City of Akron v. Akron Center for

Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 458 (1983), Justice O’Connor had suggested that
the Roe trimester framework “is clearly on a collision course with itself. As the medi-
cal risks of various abortion procedures decrease, the point at which the State may
regulate for reasons of maternal health is moved further forward to actual child-
birth. As medical science becomes better able to provide for the separate existence
of the fetus, the point of viability is moved further back toward conception.”
