    Due process considerations can also come into play in sentenc-
ing if the state attempts to withhold relevant information from the
jury. For instance, inSimmons v. South Carolina, the Court held
that due process requires that if prosecutor makes an argument for
the death penalty based on the future dangerousness of the defen-
dant to society, the jury must then be informed if the only alterna-
tive to a death sentence is a life sentence without possibility of pa-
role.1172 But, in Ramdass v. Angelone,1173 the Court refused to apply
the reasoning of Simmons because the defendant was not techni-
cally parole ineligible at time of sentencing.
    A defendant should not be penalized for exercising a right to
appeal. Thus, it is a denial of due process for a judge to sentence a
convicted defendant on retrial to a longer sentence than he re-
ceived after the first trial if the object of the sentence is to punish
the defendant for having successfully appealed his first conviction
or to discourage similar appeals by others.1174 If the judge does im-
pose a longer sentence the second time, he must justify it on the
record by showing, for example, the existence of new information
meriting a longer sentence.1175
    Because the possibility of vindictiveness in resentencing is de
minimis when it is the jury that sentences, however, the require-
ment of justifying a more severe sentence upon resentencing is in-
applicable to jury sentencing, at least in the absence of a showing
that the jury knew of the prior vacated sentence.1176 The presump-
tion of vindictiveness is also inapplicable if the first sentence was
imposed following a guilty plea. Here the Court reasoned that a trial

     1174 North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969). Pearce was held to be nonretroac-

tive in Michigan v. Payne, 412 U.S. 47 (1973). When a state provides a two-tier court
system in which one may have an expeditious and somewhat informal trial in an
inferior court with an absolute right to trial de novo in a court of general criminal
jurisdiction if convicted, the second court is not bound by the rule in Pearce, be-
cause the potential for vindictiveness and inclination to deter is not present. Colten
v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104 (1972). But see Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974),
discussed supra.
     1175 An intervening conviction on other charges for acts committed prior to the

first sentencing may justify imposition of an increased sentence following a second
trial. Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559 (1984).
     1176 Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17 (1973). The Court concluded that the

possibility of vindictiveness was so low because normally the jury would not know
of the result of the prior trial nor the sentence imposed, nor would it feel either the
personal or institutional interests of judges leading to efforts to discourage the seek-
ing of new trials. Justices Stewart, Brennan, and Marshall thought the principle
was applicable to jury sentencing and that prophylactic limitations appropriate to
the problem should be developed. Id. at 35, 38. Justice Douglas dissented on other
grounds. Id. at 35. The Pearce presumption that an increased, judge-imposed second
