portionate deductions for all prior taxes that the personal represen-
tative can prove to have been paid.513 In addition, the Court found
no violation of property rights when a state asserts a prior lien against
trucks repossessed by a vendor from a carrier (1) accruing from the
operation by the carrier of trucks not sold by the vendors, either
before or during the time the carrier operated the vendors’ trucks,
or (2) arising from assessments against the carrier, after the trucks
were repossessed, but based upon the carrier’s operations preced-
ing such repossession. Such lien need not be limited to trucks owned
by the carrier because the wear on the highways occasioned by the
carrier’s operation is in no way altered by the vendor’s retention of
title.514
    As a state may provide in advance that taxes will bear interest
from the time they become due, it may with equal validity stipu-
late that taxes which have become delinquent will bear interest from
the time the delinquency commenced. Further, a state may adopt
new remedies for the collection of taxes and apply these remedies
to taxes already delinquent.515 After liability of a taxpayer has been
fixed by appropriate procedure, collection of a tax by distress and
seizure of his person does not deprive him of liberty without due
process of law.516 Nor is a foreign insurance company denied due
process of law when its personal property is distrained to satisfy
unpaid taxes.517
    The requirements of due process are fulfilled by a statute which,
in conjunction with affording an opportunity to be heard, provides
for the forfeiture of titles to land for failure to list and pay taxes
thereon for certain specified years.518 No less constitutional, as a
means of facilitating collection, is an in rem proceeding, to which
the land alone is made a party, whereby tax liens on land are fore-
closed and all preexisting rights or liens are eliminated by a sale
under a decree.519 On the other hand, although the conversion of
an unpaid special assessment into both a personal judgment against
the owner as well as a charge on the land is consistent with the
Fourteenth Amendment,520 a judgment imposing personal liability
against a nonresident taxpayer over whom the state court acquired
