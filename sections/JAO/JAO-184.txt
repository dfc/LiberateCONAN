following enactment of said provision.982 Similarly, an amendment
to a workmen’s compensation act, limiting to three years the time
within which a case may be reopened for readjustment of compen-
sation on account of aggravation of a disability, does not deny due
process to one who sustained his injury at a time when the statute
contained no limitation. A limitation is deemed to affect the rem-
edy only, and the period of its operation in this instance was viewed
as neither arbitrary nor oppressive.983
    Moreover, a state may extend as well as shorten the time in
which suits may be brought in its courts and may even entirely re-
move a statutory bar to the commencement of litigation. Thus, a
repeal or extension of a statute of limitations affects no unconstitu-
tional deprivation of property of a debtor-defendant in whose favor
such statute had already become a defense. “A right to defeat a just
debt by the statute of limitation . . . [is not] a vested right,” such
as is protected by the Constitution. Accordingly no offense against
the Fourteenth Amendment is committed by revival, through an ex-
tension or repeal, of an action on an implied obligation to pay a
child for the use of her property,984 or a suit to recover the pur-
chase price of securities sold in violation of a Blue Sky Law,985 or a
right of an employee to seek, on account of the aggravation of a
former injury, an additional award out of a state-administered fund.986
     However, for suits to recover real and personal property, when
the right of action has been barred by a statute of limitations and
title as well as real ownership have become vested in the defen-
dant, any later act removing or repealing the bar would be void as
attempting an arbitrary transfer of title.987 Also unconstitutional is
the application of a statute of limitation to extend a period that
parties to a contract have agreed should limit their right to rem-
edies under the contract. “When the parties to a contract have ex-
pressly agreed upon a time limit on their obligation, a statute which
invalidates . . . [said] agreement and directs enforcement of the con-
tract after . . . [the agreed] time has expired” unconstitutionally im-
poses a burden in excess of that contracted.988

had not been in possession for five years after and fifteen years before said enact-
ment thereby deprived of property without due process.
