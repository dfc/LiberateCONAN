that 79 percent of the county’s population was Spanish-surnamed,
whereas jurors selected in recent years ranged from 39 to 50 per-
cent Spanish-surnamed, was sufficient to establish a prima facie case
of discrimination. Several factors probably account for the differ-
ence. First, the Court has long recognized that discrimination in
jury selection can be inferred from less of a disproportion than is
needed to show other discriminations, in major part because if jury
selection is truly random any substantial disproportion reveals the
presence of an impermissible factor, whereas most official decisions
are not random.1462 Second, the jury selection process was “highly
subjective” and thus easily manipulated for discriminatory pur-
poses, unlike the process in Davis and Arlington Heights, which was
regularized and open to inspection.1463 Thus, jury cases are likely
to continue to be special cases and, in the usual fact situation, at
least where the process is open, plaintiffs will bear a heavy and
substantial burden in showing discriminatory racial and other ani-
mus.

Taxation
    At the outset, the Court did not regard the Equal Protection
Clause as having any bearing on taxation.1464 It soon, however, en-
tertained cases assailing specific tax laws under this provision,1465
and in 1890 it cautiously conceded that “clear and hostile discrimi-
nations against particular persons and classes, especially such as
are of an unusual character, unknown to the practice of our govern-
ments, might be obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition.” 1466 The
Court observed, however, that the Equal Protection Clause “was not
intended to compel the State to adopt an iron rule of equal taxa-
tion” and propounded some conclusions that remain valid today.1467
