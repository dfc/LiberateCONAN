and equal access to the courts.” 2021 “In all cases the duty of the
State is to provide the indigent as adequate and effective an appel-
late review as that given appellants with funds. . . .” 2022 No state
may condition the right to appeal 2023 or the right to file a petition
for habeas corpus 2024 or other form of postconviction relief upon the
payment of a docketing fee or some other type of fee when the peti-
tioner has no means to pay. Similarly, although the states are not
required to furnish full and complete transcripts of their trials to
indigents when excerpted versions or some other adequate substi-
tute is available, if a transcript is necessary to adequate review of
a conviction, either on appeal or through procedures for postconvic-
tion relief, the transcript must be provided to indigent defendants
or to others unable to pay.2025 This right may not be denied by draw-
ing a felony-misdemeanor distinction or by limiting it to those cases
in which confinement is the penalty.2026 A defendant’s right to coun-
sel is to be protected as well as the similar right of the defendant
