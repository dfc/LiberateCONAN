“The Fourteenth Amendment and the laws adopted under its au-
thority thus embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in
this country shall abide ‘in any state’ on an equality of legal privi-
leges with all citizens under nondiscriminatory laws.” Justice Black
said for the Court that “the power of a state to apply its laws exclu-
sively to its alien inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow
limits.” 1769
     Announcing “that classifications based on alienage . . . are in-
herently suspect and subject to close scrutiny,” the Court struck down
state statutes which either wholly disqualified resident aliens for
welfare assistance or imposed a lengthy durational residency re-
quirement on eligibility.1770 Thereafter, in a series of decisions, the
Court adhered to its conclusion that alienage was a suspect classi-
fication and voided a variety of restrictions. More recently, how-
ever, it has created a major “political function” exception to strict
scrutiny review, which shows some potential of displacing the pre-
vious analysis almost entirely.
     In Sugarman v. Dougall,1771 the Court voided the total exclu-
sion of aliens from a state’s competitive civil service. A state’s power
“to preserve the basic conception of a political community” enables
it to prescribe the qualifications of its officers and voters,1772 the
Court held, and this power would extend “also to persons holding
state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and ju-
dicial positions, for officers who participate directly in the formula-
tion, execution, or review of broad public policy perform functions
that go to the heart of representative government.” 1773 But a flat
ban upon much of the state’s career public service, both of policy-
making and non-policy-making jobs, ran afoul of the requirement
that in achieving a valid interest through the use of a suspect clas-
sification the state must employ means that are precisely drawn in
light of the valid purpose.1774
     1769 334 U.S. at 420. The decision was preceded by Oyama v. California, 332

U.S. 633 (1948), which was also susceptible of being read as questioning the prem-
ise of the earlier cases.

     1771 413 U.S. 634 (1973).

Aliens can be excluded from voting, Skatfe v. Rorex, 553 P.2d 830 (Colo. 1976), ap-
peal dismissed for lack of substantial federal question, 430 U.S. 961 (1977), and can
be excluded from service on juries. Perkins v. Smith, 370 F. Supp. 134 (D. Md. 1974)
(3-judge court), aff ’d, 426 U.S. 913 (1976).
     1773 Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647 (1973). Such state restrictions are

“not wholly immune from scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 648.
     1774 Justice Rehnquist dissented. 413 U.S. at 649. In the course of the opinion,

the Court held inapplicable the doctrine of “special public interest,” the idea that a
State’s concern with the restriction of the resources of the State to the advancement
and profit of its citizens is a valid basis for discrimination against out-of-state citi-
