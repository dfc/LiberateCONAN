tion which is entirely arbitrary and which operates to deny a fair
opportunity to repel it or to present facts pertinent to one’s defense
is void.995 On the other hand, if there is a rational connection be-
tween what is proved and what is inferred, legislation declaring that
the proof of one fact or group of facts shall constitute prima facie
evidence of a main or ultimate fact will be sustained.996
     For a brief period, the Court used what it called the “irrebut-
table presumption doctrine” to curb the legislative tendency to con-
fer a benefit or to impose a detriment based on presumed character-
istics based on the existence of another characteristic.997 Thus, in
Stanley v. Illinois,998 the Court found invalid a construction of the
state statute that presumed illegitimate fathers to be unfit parents
and that prevented them from objecting to state wardship. Manda-
tory maternity leave rules requiring pregnant teachers to take un-
paid maternity leave at a set time prior to the date of the expected
births of their babies were voided as creating a conclusive presump-
tion that every pregnant teacher who reaches a particular point of
pregnancy becomes physically incapable of teaching.999
     Major controversy developed over the application of “irrebut-
table presumption doctrine” in benefits cases. Thus, although a state
may require that nonresidents must pay higher tuition charges at
state colleges than residents, and while the Court assumed that a
durational residency requirement would be permissible as a prereq-
uisite to qualify for the lower tuition, it was held impermissible for
the state to presume conclusively that because the legal address of
a student was outside the state at the time of application or at some
point during the preceding year he was a nonresident as long as he
     995 Presumptions were voided in Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219 (1911) (any-

one breaching personal services contract guilty of fraud); Manley v. Georgia, 279 U.S.
1 (1929) (every bank insolvency deemed fraudulent); Western & Atlantic R.R. v. Hen-
derson, 279 U.S. 639 (1929) (collision between train and auto at grade crossing con-
stitutes negligence by railway company); Carella v. California, 491 U.S. 263 (1989)
(conclusive presumption of theft and embezzlement upon proof of failure to return a
rental vehicle).
     996 Presumptions sustained include Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898)

(person convicted of felony unfit to practice medicine); Hawes v. Georgia, 258 U.S. 1
(1922) (person occupying property presumed to have knowledge of still found on prop-
erty); Bandini Co. v. Superior Court, 284 U.S. 8 (1931) (release of natural gas into
the air from well presumed wasteful); Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Ford, 287 U.S.
502 (1933) (rebuttable presumption of railroad negligence for accident at grade cross-
ing). See also Morrison v. California, 291 U.S. 82 (1934).
     997 The approach was not unprecedented, some older cases having voided tax

legislation that presumed conclusively an ultimate fact. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin,
270 U.S. 230 (1926) (deeming any gift made by decedent within six years of death
to be a part of estate denies estate’s right to prove gift was not made in contempla-
tion of death); Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312 (1932); Hoeper v. Tax Comm’n, 284
U.S. 206 (1931).
     998 405 U.S. 645 (1972).
     999 Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974).
