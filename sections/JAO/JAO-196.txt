band,1050 or they may may seek to test the integrity of public em-
ployees, officers or public officials by offering them bribes.1051 In such
cases, an “entrapment” defense is often made, though it is unclear
whether the basis for the defense is the Due Process Clause, the
supervisory authority of the federal courts to deter wrongful police
conduct, or merely statutory construction (interpreting criminal laws
to find that the legislature would not have intended to punish con-
duct induced by police agents).1052
    The Court has employed the so-called “subjective approach” in
evaluating the defense of entrapment.1053 This subjective approach
     1050 For instance, in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 446–49 (1932) and

Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 380 (1958) government agents solicited de-
fendants to engage in the illegal activity, in United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423,
490 (1973), the agents supplied a commonly available ingredient, and in Hampton
v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 488–89 (1976), the agents supplied an essential and
difficult to obtain ingredient.
     1051 For instance, this strategy was seen in the “Abscam” congressional bribery

controversy. The defense of entrapment was rejected as to all the “Abscam” defen-
dants. E.g., United States v. Kelly, 707 F.2d 1460 (D.C. Cir. 1983); United States v.
Williams, 705 F.2d 603 (2d Cir. 1983); United States v. Jannotti, 673 F.2d 578 (3d
Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1106 (1982).
     1052 For a thorough evaluation of the basis for and the nature of the entrap-

ment defense, see Seidman, The Supreme Court, Entrapment, and Our Criminal Jus-
tice Dilemma, 1981 SUP. CT. REV. 111. The Court’s first discussion of the issue was
based on statutory grounds, see Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 446–49 (1932),
and that basis remains the choice of some Justices. Hampton v. United States, 425
U.S. 484, 488–89 (1976) (plurality opinion of Justices Rehnquist and White and Chief
Justice Burger). In Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 380 (1958) (concur-
ring), however, Justice Frankfurter based his opinion on the supervisory powers of
the courts. In United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 490 (1973), however, the Court
rejected the use of that power, as did a plurality in Hampton, 425 U.S. at 490. The
Hampton plurality thought the Due Process Clause would never be applicable, no
matter what conduct government agents engaged in, unless they violated some pro-
tected right of the defendant, and that inducement and encouragement could never
do that. Justices Powell and Blackmun, on the other hand, 411 U.S. at 491, thought
that police conduct, even in the case of a predisposed defendant, could be so outra-
geous as to violate due process. The Russell and Hampton dissenters did not clearly
differentiate between the supervisory power and due process but seemed to believe
that both were implicated. 411 U.S. at 495 (Justices Brennan, Stewart, and Mar-
shall); Russell, 411 U.S. at 439 (Justices Stewart, Brennan, and Marshall). The Court
again failed to clarify the basis for the defense in Mathews v. United States, 485
U.S. 58 (1988) (a defendant in a federal criminal case who denies commission of the
crime is entitled to assert an “inconsistent” entrapment defense where the evidence
warrants), and in Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540 (1992) (invalidating a
conviction under the Child Protection Act of 1984 because government solicitation
induced the defendant to purchase child pornography).
     1053 An “objective approach,” although rejected by the Supreme Court, has been

advocated by some Justices and recommended for codification by Congress and the
state legislatures. See American Law Institute, MODEL PENAL CODE § 2.13 (Official Draft,
1962); NATIONAL COMMISSION ON REFORM OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS, A PROPOSED NEW FED-
ERAL CRIMINAL CODE § 702(2) (Final Draft, 1971). The objective approach disregards
the defendant’s predisposition and looks to the inducements used by government agents.
If the government employed means of persuasion or inducement creating a substan-
tial risk that the person tempted will engage in the conduct, the defense would be
