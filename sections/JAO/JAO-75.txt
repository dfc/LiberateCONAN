Taxing Power
     Generally.—It was not contemplated that the adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment would restrain or cripple the taxing power
of the states.387 When the power to tax exists, the extent of the bur-
den is a matter for the discretion of the lawmakers,388 and the Court
will refrain from condemning a tax solely on the ground that it is
excessive.389 Nor can the constitutionality of taxation be made to
depend upon the taxpayer’s enjoyment of any special benefits from
use of the funds raised by taxation.390
     Theoretically, public moneys cannot be expended for other than
public purposes. Some early cases applied this principle by invali-
dating taxes judged to be imposed to raise money for purely pri-
vate rather than public purposes.391 However, modern notions of pub-
lic purpose have expanded to the point where the limitation has
little practical import.392 Whether a use is public or private, al-
though ultimately a judicial question, “is a practical question ad-
dressed to the law-making department, and it would require a plain
case of departure from every public purpose which could reason-
ably be conceived to justify the intervention of a court.” 393
     387 Tonawanda v. Lyon, 181 U.S. 389 (1901); Cass Farm Co. v. Detroit, 181 U.S.

396 (1901). Rather, the purpose of the amendment was to extend to the residents of
the states the same protection against arbitrary state legislation affecting life, lib-
erty, and property as was afforded against Congress by the Fifth Amendment. South-
western Oil Co. v. Texas, 217 U.S. 114, 119 (1910).
     388 Fox v. Standard Oil Co., 294 U.S. 87, 99 (1935).
     389 Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, 294 U.S. 550 (1935). See also Kelly v. City

of Pittsburgh, 104 U.S. 78 (1881); Chapman v. Zobelein, 237 U.S. 135 (1915); Alaska
Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U.S. 44 (1921); Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40 (1934);

     390 Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, 288 U.S. 249 (1933); Carmichael v. South-

ern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U.S. 495 (1937). A taxpayer, therefore, cannot contest the
imposition of an income tax on the ground that, in operation, it returns to his town
less income tax than he and its other inhabitants pay. Dane v. Jackson, 256 U.S.
589 (1921).
     391 Loan Association v. Topeka, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 655 (1875) (voiding tax em-

ployed by city to make a substantial grant to a bridge manufacturing company to
induce it to locate its factory in the city). See also City of Parkersburg v. Brown, 106
U.S. 487 (1882) (private purpose bonds not authorized by state constitution).
     392 Taxes levied for each of the following purposes have been held to be for a

public use: a city coal and fuel yard, Jones v. City of Portland, 245 U.S. 217 (1917),
a state bank, a warehouse, an elevator, a flour mill system, homebuilding projects,
Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 300 U.S. 644 (1937), a society for prevent-
ing cruelty to animals (dog license tax), Nicchia v. New York, 254 U.S. 228 (1920), a
railroad tunnel, Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Dist., 262 U.S. 710 (1923), books for school
children attending private as well as public schools, Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of
Educ., 281 U.S. 370 (1930), and relief of unemployment, Carmichael v. Southern Coal
& Coke Co., 301 U.S. 495, 515 (1937).
     393 In applying the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause the Court has said

that discretion as to what is a public purpose “belongs to Congress, unless the choice
is clearly wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of judgment.” Helver-
ing v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 640 (1937); United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 67 (1936).
