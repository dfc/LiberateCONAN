    Sufficiency of Remedy.—When no other remedy is available,
due process is denied by a judgment of a state court withholding a
decree in equity to enjoin collection of a discriminatory tax.528 Re-
quirements of due process are similarly violated by a statute that
limits a taxpayer’s right to challenge an assessment to cases of fraud
or corruption,529 and by a state tribunal that prevents the recovery
of taxes imposed in violation of the Constitution and laws of the
United States by invoking a state law that allows suits to recover
taxes alleged to have been assessed illegally only if the taxes had
been paid at the time and in the manner provided by such law.530
In the case of a tax held unconstitutional as a discrimination against
interstate commerce and not invalidated in its entirety, the state
has several alternatives for equalizing incidence of the tax: it may
pay a refund equal to the difference between the tax paid and the
tax that would have been due under rates afforded to in-state com-
petitors; it may assess and collect back taxes from those competi-
tors; or it may combine the two approaches.531
     Laches.—Persons failing to avail themselves of an opportunity
to object and be heard cannot thereafter complain of assessments
as arbitrary and unconstitutional.532 Likewise a car company that
failed to report its gross receipts, as required by statute, has no

     527 Nelson v. New York City, 352 U.S. 103 (1956). This conclusion was unaf-

fected by the disparity between the value of the land taken and the amount owed
the city. Having issued appropriate notices, the city cannot be held responsible for
the negligence of the bookkeeper and the managing trustee in overlooking arrear-
ages on tax bills, nor is it obligated to inquire why appellants regularly paid real
estate taxes on their property.

U.S. 17 (1920). In this as in other areas, the state must provide procedural safe-
guards against imposition of an unconstitutional tax. These procedures need not ap-
ply predeprivation, but a state that denies predeprivation remedy by requiring that
tax payments be made before objections are heard must provide a postdeprivation
remedy. McKesson Corp. v. Florida Alcohol & Tobacco Div., 496 U.S. 18 (1990). See
also Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106 (1994) (violation of due process to hold out a
post-deprivation remedy for unconstitutional taxation and then, after the disputed
taxes had been paid, to declare that no such remedy exists); Newsweek, Inc. v. Florida
Dep’t of Revenue, 522 U.S. 442 (1998) (per curiam) (violation of due process to limit
remedy to one who pursued pre-payment of tax, where litigant reasonably relied on
apparent availability of post-payment remedy).
