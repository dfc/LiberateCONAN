in New York. The Court explained that, “[l]ike any standard that
requires a determination of ‘reasonableness,’ the ‘minimum con-
tacts’ test . . . is not susceptible of mechanical application; rather,
the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the
requisite ‘affiliating circumstances’ are present.” 871 Although the Court
noted that the “effects” test had been accepted as a test of contacts
when wrongful activity outside a state causes injury within the state
or when commercial activity affects state residents, the Court found
that these factors were not present in this case, and any economic
benefit to Kulko was derived in New York and not in California.872
As with many such cases, the decision was narrowly limited to its
facts and does little to clarify the standards applicable to state ju-
risdiction over nonresidents.
    Suing Out-of-State (Foreign) Corporations.—A curious as-
pect of American law is that a corporation has no legal existence
outside the boundaries of the state chartering it.873 Thus, the basis
for state court jurisdiction over an out-of-state (“foreign”) corpora-
tion has been even more uncertain than that with respect to indi-
viduals. Before International Shoe Co. v. Washington,874 it was as-
serted that, because a corporation could not carry on business in a
state without the state’s permission, the state could condition its
permission upon the corporation’s consent to submit to the jurisdic-
tion of the state’s courts, either by appointment of someone to re-
ceive process or in the absence of such designation, by accepting
service upon corporate agents authorized to operate within the state.875
Further, by doing business in a state, the corporation was deemed
to be present there and thus subject to service of process and suit.876
This theoretical corporate presence conflicted with the idea of cor-
porations having no existence outside their state of incorporation,
but it was nonetheless accepted that a corporation “doing business”
in a state to a sufficient degree was “present” for service of process
upon its agents in the state who carried out that business.877
