tion have long been considered lawful exertions of the police power.232
Thus, a prohibition on the issuance or sale by other than an autho-
rized weigher of any weight certificate for grain weighed at any ware-
house or elevator where state weighers are stationed is not uncon-
stitutional.233 Similarly, the power of a state to prescribe standard
containers to protect buyers from deception as well as to facilitate
trading and to preserve the condition of the merchandise is not open
to question.234
    A variety of other business regulations that tend to prevent fraud
have withstood constitutional scrutiny. Thus, a state may require
that the nature of a product be fairly set forth, despite the right of
a manufacturer to maintain secrecy as to his compounds.235 Or, a
statute providing that the purchaser of harvesting or threshing ma-
chinery for his own use shall have a reasonable time after delivery
for inspecting and testing it, and may rescind the contract if the
machinery does not prove reasonably adequate, does not violate the
Due Process Clause.236 Further, in the exercise of its power to pre-
vent fraud and imposition, a state may regulate trading in securi-
ties within its borders, require a license of those engaging in such
dealing, make issuance of a license dependent on the good repute
of the applicants, and permit, subject to judicial review of his find-
ings, revocation of the license.237

by a public weighmaster within the city valid even as applied to one delivering coal
from state-tested scales at a mine outside the city); Lemieux v. Young, 211 U.S. 489

     234 Pacific States Co. v. White, 296 U.S. 176 (1935) (administrative order pre-

scribing the dimensions, form, and capacity of containers for strawberries and rasp-
berries is not arbitrary as the form and dimensions bore a reasonable relation to
the protection of the buyers and the preservation in transit of the fruit); Schmidinger
v. City of Chicago, 226 U.S. 578 (1913) (ordinance fixing standard sizes is not uncon-
stitutional); Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, 240 U.S. 510 (1916) (law that lard not
sold in bulk should be put up in containers holding one, three, or five pounds weight,
or some whole multiple of these numbers valid); Petersen Baking Co. v. Bryan, 290

for a loaf of bread upheld); But cf. Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U.S. 504 (1924)
(tolerance of only two ounces in excess of the minimum weight per loaf is unreason-
able, given finding that it was impossible to manufacture good bread without fre-
quently exceeding the prescribed tolerance).
