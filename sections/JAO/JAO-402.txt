cations and were thus discriminatory in intent and effect. The Court
determined that it would not then reevaluate the competing consid-
erations that might have led Congress to its conclusion. Instead,
the Justice wrote that Congress “brought a specially informed leg-
islative competence” to an appraisal of voting requirements and “it
was Congress’s prerogative to weigh” the considerations. The Court’s
role in that case was to sustain the conclusion if “we perceive a
basis upon which Congress might predicate a judgment” that the
requirements constituted invidious discrimination.2116 This highly
deferential standard meant that the Court would uphold Congres-
sional legislation under § 5 if there was a “rational basis” to do so.2117
    In dissent, Justice Harlan protested that “[i]n effect the Court
reads § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment as giving Congress the power
to define the substantive scope of the Amendment. If that indeed
be the true reach of § 5, then I do not see why Congress should not
be able as well to exercise its § 5 ‘discretion’ by enacting statutes
so as in effect to dilute equal protection and due process decisions
of this Court.” 2118 Justice Brennan rejected this reasoning: “We em-
phasize that Congress’s power under § 5 is limited to adopting mea-
sures to enforce the guarantees of the Amendment; § 5 grants Con-
gress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute these guarantees.” 2119
    Congress, however, has not always heeded this admonontion. On
the one hand, it relied on Morgan in the 1968 Civil Rights Act to
expand federal powers to deal with private violence that is racially
motivated, and to some degree in outlawing most private housing
discrimination.2120 On the other hand, it expressly invoked Morgan
when enacting provisions of law purporting to overrule the Court’s
expansion of the self-incrimination and right-to-counsel clauses of
the Bill of Rights.2121 Movements have also been initiated in Con-
gress by opponents of certain of the other Court decisions, notably


    2116 Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 653–56 (1966).
    2117 Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 440–441 (1968)
    2118 384 U.S. at 668. Justice Stewart joined this dissent.
    2119 384 U.S. at 651 n.10. Justice O’Connor for the Court quoted and reiterated

Justice Brennan’s language in Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718,
731–33 (1982).
    2120 82 Stat. 73, 18 U.S.C. § 245. See S. REP. NO. 721, 90th Congress, 1st Sess.

6–7 (1967). See also 82 Stat. 81, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.
    2121 See Title II, Omnibus Safe Streets and Crime Control Act, 82 Stat. 210, 18

U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3502; S. REP. NO. 1097, 90th Congress, 2d Sess. 53–63 (1968). The
cases that were purported to be overuled were were Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.
436 (1966), and United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967).
