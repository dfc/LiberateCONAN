Or, in other cases, the Court has found that contemptuous behav-
ior in court may affect the impartiality of the presiding judge, so as
to disqualify such judge from citing and sentencing the contemnors.1068
Due process is also violated by the participation of a biased or oth-
erwise partial juror, although there is no presumption that all ju-
rors with a potential bias are in fact prejudiced.1069
    Public hostility toward a defendant that intimidates a jury is,
or course, a classic due process violation.1070 More recently, concern
with the impact of prejudicial publicity upon jurors and potential
jurors has caused the Court to instruct trial courts that they should
be vigilant to guard against such prejudice and to curb both the
publicity and the jury’s exposure to it.1071 For instance, the impact
of televising trials on a jury has been a source of some concern.1072
     1068 Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 464 (1971) (“it is generally wise

where the marks of unseemly conduct have left personal stings [for a judge] to ask
a fellow judge to take his place”); Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (where
“marked personal feelings were present on both sides,” a different judge should pre-
side over a contempt hearing). But see Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575 (1964) (“We
cannot assume that judges are so irascible and sensitive that they cannot fairly and
impartially deal with resistance to authority”). In the context of alleged contempt
before a judge acting as a one-man grand jury, the Court reversed criminal con-
tempt convictions, saying: “A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of
due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of
cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability
of unfairness.” In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955).
     1069 Ordinarily the proper avenue of relief is a hearing at which the juror may

be questioned and the defense afforded an opportunity to prove actual bias. Smith
v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982) (juror had job application pending with prosecutor’s
office during trial). See also Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227 (1954) (bribe
offer to sitting juror); Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162, 167–72 (1950) (govern-
ment employees on jury). But, a trial judge’s refusal to question potential jurors about
the contents of news reports to which they had been exposed did not violate the
defendant’s right to due process, it being sufficient that the judge on voir dire asked
the jurors whether they could put aside what they had heard about the case, listen
to the evidence with an open mind, and render an impartial verdict. Mu’Min v. Vir-
ginia, 500 U.S. 415 (1991). Nor is it a denial of due process for the prosecution,
after a finding of guilt, to call the jury’s attention to the defendant’s prior criminal
record, if the jury has been given a sentencing function to increase the sentence
which would otherwise be given under a recidivist statute. Spencer v. Texas, 385
U.S. 554 (1967). For discussion of the requirements of jury impartiality about capi-
tal punishment, see discussion under Sixth Amendment, supra.
     1070 Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309 (1915); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86 (1923).
     1071 Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S.

723 (1963); Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 (1961); But see Stroble v. California, 343
U.S. 181 (1952); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794 (1975).
     1072 Initially, the televising of certain trials was struck down on the grounds that

the harmful potential effect on the jurors was substantial, that the testimony pre-
sented at trial may be distorted by the multifaceted influence of television upon the
conduct of witnesses, that the judge’s ability to preside over the trial and guarantee
fairness is considerably encumbered to the possible detriment of fairness, and that
the defendant is likely to be harassed by his television exposure. Estes v. Texas, 381
U.S. 532 (1965). Subsequently, however, in part because of improvements in technol-
ogy which caused much less disruption of the trial process and in part because of
