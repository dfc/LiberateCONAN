for purposes of a personal judgment, and process can be obtained
by means of appropriate, substituted service or by actual personal
service on the resident outside the state.858 However, if the defen-
dant, although technically domiciled there, has left the state with
no intention to return, service by publication, as compared to a sum-
mons left at his last and usual place of abode where his family con-
tinued to reside, is inadequate, because it is not reasonably calcu-
lated to give actual notice of the proceedings and opportunity to be
heard.859
    With respect to a nonresident, it is clearly established that no
person can be deprived of property rights by a decree in a case in
which he neither appeared nor was served or effectively made a
party.860 The early cases held that the process of a court of one state
could not run into another and summon a resident of that state to
respond to proceedings against him, when neither his person nor
his property was within the jurisdiction of the court rendering the
judgment.861 This rule, however, has been attenuated in a series of
steps.
    Consent has always been sufficient to create jurisdiction, even
in the absence of any other connection between the litigation and
the forum. For example, the appearance of the defendant for any
purpose other than to challenge the jurisdiction of the court was
deemed a voluntary submission to the court’s power,862 and even a
special appearance to deny jurisdiction might be treated as consen-
sual submission to the court.863 The concept of “constructive con-
sent” was then seized upon as a basis for obtaining jurisdiction. For
65 YALE L. J. 289 (1956). But in Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990),
the Court held that service of process on a nonresident physically present within
the state satisfies due process regardless of the duration or purpose of the nonresi-
dent’s visit.

     863 State legislation which provides that a defendant who comes into court to

challenge the validity of service upon him in a personal action surrenders himself
to the jurisdiction of the court, but which allows him to dispute where process was
served, is constitutional and does not deprive him of property without due process
of law. In such a situation, the defendant may ignore the proceedings as wholly in-
effective, and attack the validity of the judgment if and when an attempt is made to
take his property thereunder. If he desires, however, to contest the validity of the
