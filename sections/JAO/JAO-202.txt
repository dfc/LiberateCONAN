in identifiable prison clothes, because it may impair the presump-
tion of innocence in the minds of the jurors.1076
     The use of visible physical restraints, such as shackles, leg irons,
or belly chains, in front of a jury, has been held to raise due pro-
cess concerns. In Deck v. Missouri,1077 the Court noted a rule dat-
ing back to English common law against bringing a defendant to
trial in irons, and a modern day recognition that such measures
should be used “only in the presence of a special need.” 1078 The Court
found that the use of visible restraints during the guilt phase of a
trial undermines the presumption of innocence, limits the ability of
a defendant to consult with counsel, and “affronts the dignity and
decorum of judicial proceedings.” 1079 Even where guilt has already
been adjudicated, and a jury is considering the application of the
death penalty, the latter two considerations would preclude the rou-
tine use of visible restraints. Only in special circumstances, such
as where a judge has made particularized findings that security or
flight risk requires it, can such restraints be used.
     The combination of otherwise acceptable rules of criminal tri-
als may in some instances deny a defendant due process. Thus, based
on the particular circumstance of a case, two rules that (1) denied
a defendant the right to cross-examine his own witness in order to
elicit evidence exculpatory to the defendant 1080 and (2) denied a de-
fendant the right to introduce the testimony of witnesses about mat-
ters told them out of court on the ground the testimony would be
hearsay, denied the defendant his constitutional right to present his
own defense in a meaningful way.1081 Similarly, a questionable pro-
cedure may be saved by its combination with another. Thus, it does

Flynn, 475 U.S. 560 (1986) (presence in courtroom of uniformed state troopers serv-

actor courtroom conduct—in this case, members of victim’s family wearing buttons
with the victim’s photograph—has never been addressed by the Supreme Court and
therefore 18 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) precludes habeas relief; see Amendment 8, Limita-
tions on Habeas Corpus Review of Capital Sentences).

stated, in dictum, that “no person should be tried while shackled and gagged except
as a last resort.”
