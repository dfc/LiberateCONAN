construe the terms broadly or narrowly, and that the phrase “known
to be a member” was ambiguous. The statute was held void, and
the Court refused to allow specification of details in the particular
indictment to save it because it was the statute, not the indict-
ment, that prescribed the rules to govern conduct.1031
     A statute may be so vague or so threatening to constitutionally
protected activity that it can be pronounced wholly unconstitu-
tional; in other words, “unconstitutional on its face.” 1032 Thus, for
instance, a unanimous Court in Papachristou v. City of Jackson-
ville 1033 struck down as invalid on its face a vagrancy ordinance
that punished “dissolute persons who go about begging, . . . com-
mon night walkers, . . . common railers and brawlers, persons wan-
dering or strolling around from place to place without any lawful
purpose or object, habitual loafers, . . . persons neglecting all law-
ful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting house
of ill fame, gaming houses, or places where alcoholic beverages are
sold or served, persons able to work but habitually living upon the
earnings of their wives or minor children . . . .” 1034 The ordinance
was found to be facially invalid, according to Justice Douglas for
the Court, because it did not give fair notice, it did not require spe-
cific intent to commit an unlawful act, it permitted and encouraged
arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions, it committed too much
discretion to policemen, and it criminalized activities that by mod-
ern standards are normally innocent.1035

     1031 Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451 (1939); Edelman v. California, 344

U.S. 357 (1953).
     1032 Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972); Smith v. Goguen,

415 U.S. 566 (1974). Generally, a vague statute that regulates in the area of First
Amendment guarantees will be pronounced wholly void. Winters v. New York, 333
U.S. 507, 509–10 (1948); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940).
     1033 405 U.S. 156 (1972).
     1034 405 U.S. at 156 n.1. Similar concerns regarding vagrancy laws had been

expressed previously. See, e.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 540 (1948) (Jus-
tice Frankfurter dissenting); Edelman v. California, 344 U.S. 357, 362 (1953) (Jus-
tice Black dissenting); Hicks v. District of Columbia, 383 U.S. 252 (1966) (Justice
Douglas dissenting).
     1035 Similarly, an ordinance making it a criminal offense for three or more per-

sons to assemble on a sidewalk and conduct themselves in a manner annoying to
passers-by was found impermissibly vague and void on its face because it en-
croached on the freedom of assembly. Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611 (1971).
See Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87 (1965) (conviction under stat-
ute imposing penalty for failure to “move on” voided); Bouie v. City of Columbia,
378 U.S. 347 (1964) (conviction on trespass charges arising out of a sit-in at a drug-
store lunch counter voided since the trespass statute did not give fair notice that it
was a crime to refuse to leave private premises after being requested to do so); Kolender
v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 (1983) (requirement that person detained in valid Terry
stop provide “credible and reliable” identification is facially void as encouraging ar-
bitrary enforcement).
