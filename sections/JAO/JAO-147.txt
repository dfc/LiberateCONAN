employment was itself conditioned by the procedural limitations which
had accompanied the grant of that interest,” 785 the employee would
have to “take the bitter with the sweet.” 786 Thus, Congress (and by
analogy state legislatures) could qualify the conferral of an interest
by limiting the process that might otherwise be required.
     But the other six Justices, although disagreeing among them-
selves in other respects, rejected this attempt to formulate the is-
sue. “This view misconceives the origin of the right to procedural
due process,” Justice Powell wrote. “That right is conferred not by
legislative grace, but by constitutional guarantee. While the legisla-
ture may elect not to confer a property interest in federal employ-
ment, it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such
an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural safe-
guards.” 787 Yet, in Bishop v. Wood,788 the Court accepted a district
court’s finding that a policeman held his position “at will” despite
language setting forth conditions for discharge. Although the major-
ity opinion was couched in terms of statutory construction, the ma-
jority appeared to come close to adopting the three-Justice Arnett
position, so much so that the dissenters accused the majority of hav-
ing repudiated the majority position of the six Justices in Arnett.
And, in Goss v. Lopez,789 Justice Powell, writing in dissent but us-
ing language quite similar to that of Justice Rehnquist in Arnett,
seemed to indicate that the right to public education could be quali-
fied by a statute authorizing a school principal to impose a ten-day
suspension.790
    Subsequently, however, the Court held squarely that, because
“minimum [procedural] requirements [are] a matter of federal law,
they are not diminished by the fact that the State may have speci-
fied its own procedures that it may deem adequate for determining
the preconditions to adverse action.” Indeed, any other conclusion
would allow the state to destroy virtually any state-created prop-
