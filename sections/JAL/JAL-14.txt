Government.62 In this respect, the federal courts may not act with-
out congressional guidance in subjecting states to suit, and Con-
gress, which can act to the extent of its granted powers, is con-
strained by judicially created doctrines requiring it to be explicit
when it legislates against state immunity.63

Suits Against States
    Despite the apparent limitations of the Eleventh Amendment,
individuals may, under certain circumstances, bring constitutional
and statutory cases against states. In some of these cases, the state’s
sovereign immunity has either been waived by the state or abro-
gated by Congress. In other cases, the Eleventh Amendment does
not apply because the procedural posture is such that the Court
does not view them as being against a state. As discussed below,
this latter doctrine is most often seen in suits to enjoin state offi-
cials. However, it has also been invoked in bankruptcy and admi-
ralty cases, where the res, or property in dispute, is in fact the le-
gal target of a dispute.64
    The application of this last exception to the bankruptcy area
has become less relevant, because even when a bankruptcy case is
not focused on a particular res, the Court has held that a state’s
sovereign immunity is not infringed by being subject to an order of
a bankruptcy court. “The history of the Bankruptcy Clause, the rea-
sons it was inserted in the Constitution, and the legislation both
proposed and enacted under its auspices immediately following rati-
fication of the Constitution demonstrate that it was intended not
just as a grant of legislative authority to Congress, but also to au-
thorize limited subordination of state sovereign immunity in the bank-
ruptcy arena.” 65 Thus, where a federal law authorized a bank-
ruptcy trustee to recover “preferential transfers” made to state

332, 337 (1979).
     63 See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978), in which the various opinions differ

among themselves as to the degree of explicitness required. See also Quern v. Jor-
dan, 440 U.S. 332, 343–45 (1979). As noted in the previous section, later cases stiff-
ened the rule of construction. The parallelism of congressional power to regulate
and to legislate away immunity is not exact. Thus, in Employees of the Dep’t of
Pub. Health and Welfare v. Department of Pub. Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279
(1973), the Court strictly construed congressional provision of suits as not reaching
states, while in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183 (1968), it had sustained the consti-
tutionality of the substantive law.

(exercise of bankruptcy court’s in rem jurisdiction over a debtor’s estate to discharge
a debt owed to a state does not infringe the state’s sovereignty); California v. Deep
Sea Research, Inc., 523 U.S. 491, 507–08 (1998) (despite state claims over ship-
wrecked vessel, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal court in rem admi-
ralty jurisdiction where the res is not in the possession of the sovereign).
