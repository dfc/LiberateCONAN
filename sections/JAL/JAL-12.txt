such as those brought by the United States or by other states.49
Furthermore, Congress is able in at least some instances to legis-
late away state immunity,50 although it may not enlarge Article III
jurisdiction.51 The Court has declared that “the principle of sover-
eign immunity [reflected in the Eleventh Amendment] is a constitu-
tional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art.
III,” but almost in the same breath has acknowledged that “[a] sov-
ereign’s immunity may be waived.” 52
     Another explanation of the Eleventh Amendment is that it merely
recognized the continued vitality of the doctrine of sovereign immu-
nity as established prior to the Constitution: a state was not sub-
ject to suit without its consent.53 This view also has support in mod-
ern case law: “the States’ immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect
of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification
of the Constitution, and which they retain today . . . .” 54 The Court
in dealing with questions of governmental immunity from suit has
traditionally treated interchangeably precedents dealing with state
immunity and those dealing with Federal Governmental immu-
nity.55 Viewing the Amendment and its radiations into Article III
in this way provides a consistent explanation of the consent to suit
as a waiver.56 The limited effect of the doctrine in this context in
federal court arises from the fact that traditional sovereign immu-
nity arose in a unitary state, barring unconsented suit against a
sovereign in its own courts or the courts of another sovereign. But
upon entering the Union the states surrendered their sovereignty
     49 See, e.g., the Court’s express rejection of the Eleventh Amendment defense in

these cases. United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621 (1892); South Dakota v. North Caro-
lina, 192 U.S. 286 (1904).
     50 E.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976); Pennsylvania v. Union Gas

Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989).
     51 The principal citation is, of course, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137

(1803).
     52 Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98, 99 (1984).
     53 As Justice Holmes explained, the doctrine is based “on the logical and practi-

cal ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the
law on which the right depends.” Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U.S. 349, 353 (1907).
Of course, when a state is sued in federal court pursuant to federal law, the Federal
Government, not the defendant state, is “the authority that makes the law” creat-
ing the right of action. See Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 154
(1996) (Justice Souter dissenting). On the sovereign immunity of the United States,
see supra pp. 746–48. For the history and jurisprudence, see Jaffe, Suits Against
Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 HARV. L. REV. 1 (1963).
     54 Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713 (1999).
     55 See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 210–14 (1882); Belknap v. Schild,

161 U.S. 10, 18 (1896); Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, 221 U.S. 636, 642–
43, 645 (1911).
     56 A sovereign may consent to suit. E.g., United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S.

584, 586 (1941); United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.S.
506, 514 (1940).
