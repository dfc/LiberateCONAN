to some undetermined and changing degree to the national govern-
ment, a sovereign that does not have plenary power over them but
that is more than their coequal.57
    Outside the area of federal court jurisdiction, Nevada v. Hall,58
perfectly illustrates the difficulty. This case arose when a Califor-
nia resident sued a Nevada state agency in a California court be-
cause one of the agency’s employees negligently injured him in an
automobile accident in California. Although it recognized that the
rule during the framing of the Constitution was that a state could
not be sued without its consent in the courts of another sovereign,
the Court discerned no evidence in the federal constitutional struc-
ture, in the specific language, or in the intention of the Framers,
that would impose a general, federal constitutional constraint upon
the action of a state in authorizing suit in its own courts against
another state. The Court did imply that in some cases a “substan-
tial threat to our constitutional system of cooperative federalism”
might arise and occasion a different result, but this was not such a
case.59
    Within the area of federal court jurisdiction, the issue becomes
the extent to which the states upon entering the Union gave up
their immunity to suit in federal court. Chisholm held, and enact-
ment of the Eleventh Amendment reversed the holding, that the
states had given up their immunity to suit in diversity cases based
on common law or state law causes of action; Hans v. Louisiana
and subsequent cases held that the Amendment in effect codified
an understanding of broader immunity to suits based on federal causes
of action.60 Other cases have held that the states did give up their
immunity to suits by the United States or by other states and that
subjection to suit continues.61
    Still another view of the Eleventh Amendment is that it embod-
ies a state sovereignty principle limiting the power of the Federal
    57  See Fletcher, supra.
    58  440 U.S. 410 (1979).
     59 440 U.S. at 424 n.24. The Court looked to the Full Faith and Credit Clause

as a possible constitutional limitation. The dissent would have found implicit consti-
tutional assurance of state immunity as an essential component of federalism. Id.
at 427 (Justice Blackmun), 432 (Justice Rehnquist).
     60 For a while only Justice Brennan advocated this view, Parden v. Terminal

Ry., 377 U.S. 184 (1964); Employees of the Dep’t of Pub. Health and Welfare v. De-
partment of Pub. Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 298 (1973) (dissenting), but in
time he was joined by three others. See, e.g., Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473
U.S. 234, 247 (1985) (Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and
Stevens, dissenting).
     61 E.g., United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621 (1892); South Dakota v. North Caro-

lina, 192 U.S. 286 (1904). See Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U.S. 1 (2001) (state may seek
damages from another state, including damages to its citizens, provided it shows
that the state has an independent interest in the proceeding).
