     Expansion of the Immunity of the States.—Until the period
following the Civil War, Chief Justice Marshall’s understanding of
the Amendment generally prevailed. The aftermath of that conflict,
however, presented the Court occasion to consider anew the circum-
stances and import of the Amendment’s adoption. Following the war,
Congress effectively gave the federal courts general federal ques-
tion jurisdiction,19 at a time when a large number of states in the
South were defaulting on their revenue bonds in violation of the
Contract Clause of the Constitution.20 As bondholders consequently
sought relief in federal courts, the Supreme Court gradually worked
itself into the position of holding that the Eleventh Amendment, or,
more properly speaking, the principles “of which the Amendment is
but an exemplification,” 21 is a bar not only of suits against a state
by citizens of other states, but also of suits brought by citizens of
that state itself.22
     Expansion as a formal holding occurred in Hans v. Louisiana,23
a suit against the state by a resident of that state brought in fed-
eral court under federal question jurisdiction, alleging a violation
of the Contract Clause in the state’s repudiation of its obligation to
pay interest on certain bonds. Admitting that the Amendment on
its face prohibited only the entertaining of a suit against a state by
citizens of another state, or citizens or subjects of a foreign state,
the Court nonetheless thought the literal language was an insuffi-
cient basis for decision. Rather, wrote Justice Bradley for the Court,
the Eleventh Amendment was a result of the “shock of surprise
throughout the country” at the Chisholm decision and reflected the
determination that the decision was wrong and that federal juris-
diction did not extend to making defendants of unwilling states.24
     Under this view, the amendment reversed an erroneous deci-
sion and restored the proper interpretation of the Constitution. The
views of the opponents of subjecting states to suit “were most sen-
sible and just; and [those views] apply equally to the present case
