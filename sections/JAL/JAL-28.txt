treasury,143 it also held that a suit would lie against a revenue offi-
cer to recover tax moneys illegally collected and still in his posses-
sion.144 Beginning, however, with Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v.
Read,145 the Court has held that this kind of suit cannot be main-
tained unless the state expressly consents to suits in the federal
courts. In this case, the state statute provided for the payment of
taxes under protest and for suits afterward against state tax collec-
tion officials for the recovery of taxes illegally collected, which rev-
enues were required to be kept segregated.146
    In Edelman v. Jordan,147 the Court appeared to begin to lay
down new restrictive interpretations of what the Eleventh Amend-
ment proscribed. The Court announced that a suit “seeking to im-
pose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state
treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.” 148 What the Court
actually held, however, was that it was permissible for federal courts
to require state officials to comply in the future with claims pay-
ment provisions of the welfare assistance sections of the Social Se-
curity Act, but that they were not permitted to hear claims seek-
ing, or issue orders directing, payment of funds found to be wrongfully
withheld.149 Conceding that some of the characteristics of prospec-
tive and retroactive relief would be the same in their effects upon
the state treasury, the Court nonetheless believed that retroactive
payments were equivalent to the imposition of liabilities which must
be paid from public funds in the treasury, and that this was barred
by the Eleventh Amendment. The spending of money from the state
treasury by state officials shaping their conduct in accordance with
a prospective-only injunction is “an ancillary effect” which “is a per-
missible and often an inevitable consequence” of Ex parte Young,
whereas “payment of state funds . . . as a form of compensation” to

party’s, then the distinction between retroactive and prospective obligations is not
important. In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635 (2002),
the Court held that a challenge to a state agency decision regarding a private par-
ty’s past and future contractual liabilities does not violate the Eleventh Amend-
ment. Id. at 648. In fact, three judges questioned whether the Eleventh Amendment
is even implicated where there is a challenge to a state’s determination of liability
between private parties. Id. at 649 (Souter, J., concurring).
