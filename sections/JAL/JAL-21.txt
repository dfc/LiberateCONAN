     In another line of case, a different majority of the Court fo-
cused not so much on the authority Congress used to subject states
to suit as on the language Congress used to overcome immunity.
Henceforth, the Court held in a 1985 decision, and even with re-
spect to statutes that were enacted prior to promulgation of this
judicial rule of construction, “Congress may abrogate the States’ con-
stitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by
making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the stat-
ute” itself.103 This means that no legislative history will suffice at
all.104
     Indeed, at one time a plurality of the Court apparently be-
lieved that only if Congress refers specifically to state sovereign im-
munity and the Eleventh Amendment will its language be unmis-
takably clear.105 Thus, the Court held in Atascadero that general
language subjecting to suit in federal court “any recipient of Fed-
eral assistance” under the Rehabilitation Act was deemed insuffi-
cient to satisfy this test, not because of any question about whether
states are “recipients” within the meaning of the provision but be-
cause “given their constitutional role, the states are not like any
other class of recipients of federal aid.” 106 As a result of these rul-
ings, Congress began to use the “magic words” the Court appeared
to insist on.107 Later, however, the Court has accepted less precise

    104  See, particularly, Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 230 (1989) (“legislative
history generally will be irrelevant”), and Hoffman v. Connecticut Dep’t of Income
Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96, 103–04 (1989).
     105 Justice Kennedy for the Court in Dellmuth, 491 U.S. at 231, expressly noted

that the statute before the Court did not demonstrate abrogation with unmistak-
ably clarity because, inter alia, it “makes no reference whatsoever to either the Elev-
enth Amendment or the States’ sovereign immunity.” Justice Scalia, one of four con-
curring Justices, expressed an “understanding” that the Court’s reasoning would allow
for clearly expressed abrogation of immunity “without explicit reference to state sov-
ereign immunity or the Eleventh Amendment.” Id. at 233.

v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223 (1989).
     107 In 1986, following Atascadero, Congress provided that states were not to be

immune under the Eleventh Amendment from suits under several laws barring dis-
crimination by recipients of federal financial assistance. Pub. L. 99–506, § 1003, 100
Stat. 1845 (1986), 42 U.S.C. § 2000d–7. Following Dellmuth, Congress amended the
statute to insert the explicit language. Pub. L. 101–476, § 103, 104 Stat. 1106 (1990),
20 U.S.C. § 1403. See also the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, Pub. L. 101–553,
§ 2, 104 Stat. 2749 (1990), 17 U.S.C. § 511 (making states and state officials liable
in damages for copyright violations).
