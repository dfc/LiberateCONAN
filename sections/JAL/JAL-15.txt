educational institutions,66 the court held that the sovereign immu-
nity of the state was not infringed despite the fact that the issue
was “ancillary” to a bankruptcy court’s in rem jurisdiction.67
     Because Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity inheres in
states and not their subdivision or establishments, a state agency
that wishes to claim state sovereign immunity must establish that
it is acting as an arm of the state: “agencies exercising state power
have been permitted to invoke the [Eleventh] Amendment in order
to protect the state treasury from liability that would have had es-
sentially the same practical consequences as a judgment against the
State itself.” 68 In evaluating such a claim, the Court will examine
state law to determine the nature of the entity, and whether to treat
it as an arm of the state.69 The Court has consistently refused to
extend Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to counties, cit-
ies, or towns,70 even though such political subdivisions exercise a
“slice of state power.” 71 Even when such entities enjoy immunity
from suit under state law, they do not have Eleventh Amendment
immunity in federal court and the states may not confer it.72 Simi-
larly, entities created pursuant to interstate compacts (and subject
to congressional approval) are not immune from suit, absent a show-


     66 A “preferential transfer” was defined as the transfer of a property interest

from an insolvent debtor to a creditor, which occurred on or within 90 days before

been entitled to receive under such bankruptcy filing. 11 U.S.C. § 547(b).

ment of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459 (1945). The fact that a state agency can be indemni-
fied for the costs of litigation does not divest the agency of its Eleventh Amendment
immunity. Regents of the University of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425 (1997).

(local school district not an arm of the state based on (1) its designation in state
law as a political subdivision, (2) the degree of supervision by the state board of
education, (3) the level of funding received from the state, and (4) the districts’ em-
powerment to generate their own revenue through the issuance of bonds or levying
taxes.

mon law immunity). See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977);

U.S. 552 (1900); Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529 (1890). In contrast to their
treatment under the Eleventh Amendment, the Court has found that state immu-
nity from federal regulation under the Tenth Amendment extends to political subdi-
visions as well. See Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).
