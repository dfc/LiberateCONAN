    In a few cases, the Court has found a waiver by implication,
but the vitality of these cases is questionable. In Parden v. Termi-
nal Railway,80 the Court ruled that employees of a state-owned rail-
road could sue the state for damages under the Federal Employers’
Liability Act. One of the two primary grounds for finding lack of
immunity was that by taking control of a railroad which was sub-
ject to the FELA, enacted some 20 years previously, the state had
effectively accepted the imposition of the Act and consented to suit.81
Distinguishing Parden as involving a proprietary activity,82 the Court
later refused to find any implied consent to suit by states partici-
pating in federal spending programs; participation was insufficient,
and only when waiver has been “stated by the most express lan-
guage or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will]
leave no room for any other reasonable construction,” will it be found.83.
Further, even if a state becomes amenable to suit under a statu-
tory condition on accepting federal funds, remedies, especially mon-
etary damages, may be limited, absent express language to the con-
trary.84
    A state may waive its immunity by initiating or participating
in litigation. In Clark v. Barnard,85 the state had filed a claim for
disputed money deposited in a federal court, and the Court held
that the state could not thereafter complain when the court awarded
the money to another claimant. However, the Court is loath to find
a waiver simply because of the decision of an official or an attorney
representing the state to litigate the merits of a suit, so that a state
may at any point in litigation raise a claim of immunity based on
     80 377 U.S. 184 (1964). The alternative but interwoven ground had to do with

Congress’s power to withdraw immunity. See also Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge
Comm’n, 359 U.S. 275 (1959).
     81 The implied waiver issue aside, Parden subsequently was overruled, a plural-

ity of the Court emphasizing that Congress had failed to abrogate state immunity
unmistakably. Welch v. Texas Dep’t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 483 U.S. 468
(1987). Justice Powell’s plurality opinion was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and
by Justices White and O’Connor. Justice Scalia, concurring, thought Parden should
be overruled because it must be assumed that Congress enacted the FELA and other
statutes with the understanding that Hans v. Louisiana shielded states from immu-
nity. Id. at 495.
     82 Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671–72 (1974). For the same distinction in

the Tenth Amendment context, see National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833,
854 n.18 (1976).
     83 Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974) (quoting id. at 673, Murray v. Wilson

Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171 (1909)); Florida Dep’t of Health v. Florida Nursing
Home Ass’n, 450 U.S. 147 (1981). Of the four Edelman dissenters, Justices Mar-
shall and Blackmun found waiver through knowing participation, 415 U.S. at 688.
In Florida Dep’t, Justice Stevens noted he would have agreed with them had he
been on the Court at the time but that he would now adhere to Edelman. Id. at
151.
     84 Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. ___, No. 08–1438, slip op. (2011).
