whether that official has the authority under state law to make a
valid waiver.86 However, this argument is only available when the
state is brought into federal court involuntarily. If a state volun-
tarily agrees to removal of a state action to federal court, the Court
has held it may not then invoke a defense of sovereign immunity
and thereby gain an unfair tactical advantage.87
    Congressional Withdrawal of Immunity.—The Constitution
grants Congress power to regulate state action by legislation. At
least in some instances when Congress does so, it may subject the
states themselves to suit by individuals to implement the legisla-
tion. The clearest example arises from the Civil War Amendments,
which directly restrict state powers and expressly authorize Con-
gress to enforce these restrictions through appropriate legisla-
tion.88 Thus, “the Eleventh Amendment and the principle of state
sovereignty which it embodies . . . are necessarily limited, by the
enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” 89 The
power to enforce the Civil War Amendments is substantive, how-
ever, not being limited to remedying judicially cognizable violations
of the amendments, but extending as well to measures that in Con-
gress’s judgment will promote compliance. 90 The principal judicial
brake on this power to abrogate state immunity in legislation en-
forcing the Civil War Amendments is the rule requiring that con-
gressional intent to subject states to suit be clearly stated.91

ment, Congress may “provide for private suits against States or state officials which
are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.”).
     90 In Maher v. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980), the Court found that Congress could

validly authorize imposition of attorneys’ fees on the state following settlement of a
suit based on both constitutional and statutory grounds, even though settlement had
prevented determination that there had been a constitutional violation. Maine v.
Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980), held that § 1983 suits could be premised on federal
statutory as well as constitutional grounds. Other cases in which attorneys’ fees were
awarded against states are Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978); and New York
Gaslight Club v. Carey, 447 U.S. 54 (1980). See also Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431
(2004) (upholding enforcement of consent decree).
     91 Even prior to the tightening of the clear statement rule over the past several

decades to require express legislative language (see note and accompanying text, infra),
application of the rule curbed congressional enforcement. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427
U.S. 445 451–53 (1976); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 693–98 (1978). Because of
its rule of clear statement, the Court in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979), held
that in enacting 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Congress had not intended to include states within
