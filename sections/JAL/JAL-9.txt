not.” 30 An in rem admiralty action may be brought, however, if the
state is not in possession of the res.31
    And in extending protection against suits brought by foreign gov-
ernments, the Court made clear the immunity flowed not from the
Eleventh Amendment but from concepts of state sovereign immu-
nity generally. “Manifestly, we cannot . . . assume that the letter of
the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against
non-consenting States. Behind the words of the constitutional pro-
visions are postulates which limit and control. There is the . . . pos-
tulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sover-
eignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where
there has been ‘a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the con-
vention.’ The Federalist, No. 81.” 32
    In the 1980s, four Justices, led by Justice Brennan, argued that
Hans was incorrectly decided, that the Amendment was intended
only to deny jurisdiction against the states in diversity cases, and
that Hans and its progeny should be overruled.33 But the remain-
ing five Justices adhered to Hans and in fact stiffened it with a
rule of construction quite severe in its effect.34 The Hans interpre-
tation was further solidified with the Court’s ruling in Seminole Tribe

     30 256 U.S. at 498. See also Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure Salvors, 458 U.S.

relying on Monaco, the Court held that the Amendment bars suits by Indian tribes
