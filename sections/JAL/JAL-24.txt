quish state-controlled property 120 and culminated in the broad read-
ing of Eleventh Amendment immunity in Hans v. Louisiana.121
     Two of the leading cases, as were many cases of this period,
were suits attempting to prevent Southern states from defaulting
on bonds.122 In Louisiana v. Jumel,123 a Louisiana citizen sought to
compel the state treasurer to apply a sinking fund that had been
created under the earlier constitution for the payment of the bonds
after a subsequent constitution had abolished this provision for re-
tiring the bonds. The proceeding was held to be a suit against the
state.124 Then, In re Ayers 125 purported to supply a rationale for
cases on the issuance of mandamus or injunctive relief against state
officers that would have severely curtailed federal judicial power.
Suit against a state officer was not barred when his action, aside
from any official authority claimed as its justification, was a wrong
simply as an individual act, such as a trespass, but if the act of the
officer did not constitute an individual wrong and was something
that only a state, through its officers, could do, the suit was in ac-
tuality a suit against the state and was barred.126 That is, the un-
constitutional nature of the state statute under which the officer
acted did not itself constitute a private cause of action. For that,
one must be able to point to an independent violation of a common
law right.127
     120 Judicial reluctance to confront government officials over government-held prop-

erty did not extend in like manner in a federal context, as was evident in United
States v. Lee, the first case in which the sovereign immunity of the United States
was claimed and rejected. United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882). See Article III,
“Suits Against United States Officials.” However, the Court sustained the suit against
the federal officers by only a 5-to-4 vote, and the dissent presented the arguments
that were soon to inform Eleventh Amendment cases.

to act contrary to the positive orders of the supreme political power of the State,
whose creatures they are, and to which they are ultimately responsible in law for
what they do. They must use the public money in the treasury and under their offi-
cial control in one way, when the supreme power has directed them to use it in
another, and they must raise more money by taxation when the same power has

     127 Ayers sought to enjoin state officials from bringing suit under an allegedly

unconstitutional statute purporting to overturn a contract between the state and
the bondholders to receive the bond coupons for tax payments. The Court asserted
that the state’s contracts impliedly contained the state’s immunity from suit, so that
express withdrawal of a supposed consent to be sued was not a violation of the con-
