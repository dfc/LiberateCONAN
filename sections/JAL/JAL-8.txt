as to that then under discussion. The letter is appealed to now, as
it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an indi-
vidual against a State. The reason against it is as strong in this
case as it was in that. It is an attempt to strain the Constitution
and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.” 25 “The
truth is, that the cognizance of suits and actions unknown to the
law, and forbidden by the law, was not contemplated by the Consti-
tution when establishing the judicial power of the United States. . . .
The suability of a State without its consent was a thing unknown
to the law.” 26 Thus, although the literal terms of the Amendment
did not so provide, “the manner in which [Chisholm] was received
by the country, the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the light
of history and the reason of the thing,” 27 led the Court unani-
mously to hold that states could not be sued by their own citizens
on grounds arising under the Constitution and laws of the United
States.
    Then, in Ex parte New York (No. 1),28 the Court held that, ab-
sent consent to suit, a state was immune to suit in admiralty, the
Eleventh Amendment’s reference to “any suit in law or equity” not-
withstanding. “That a State may not be sued without its consent is
a fundamental rule of jurisprudence . . . of which the Amendment
is but an exemplification. . . . It is true the Amendment speaks only
of suits in law or equity; but this is because . . . the Amendment
was the outcome of a purpose to set aside the effect of the decision
of this court in Chisholm v. Georgia . . . from which it naturally
came to pass that the language of the Amendment was particularly
phrased so as to reverse the construction adopted in that case.” 29
Just as Hans v. Louisiana had demonstrated the “impropriety of
construing the Amendment” so as to permit federal question suits
against a state, so “it seems to us equally clear that it cannot with
propriety be construed to leave open a suit against a State in the
admiralty jurisdiction by individuals, whether its own citizens or

was to the contrary, but observed that the language was unnecessary to the deci-

due reflection, ought not to outweigh the important considerations referred to which
lead to a different conclusion.” 134 U.S. at 20.
