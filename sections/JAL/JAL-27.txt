provided only that there are grounds to obtain federal jurisdic-
tion.137 However, in Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halder-
man,138 the Court, five-to-four, held that Young did not permit suits
in federal courts against state officers alleging violations of state
law. In the Court’s view, Young was necessary to promote the su-
premacy of federal law, a basis that disappears if the violation al-
leged is of state law. The Court also still adheres to the doctrine,
first pronounced in Madrazo,139 that some suits against officers are
“really” against the state 140 and are barred by the state’s immu-
nity, such as when the suit involves state property or asks for re-
lief which clearly calls for the exercise of official authority, such as
paying money out of the treasury to remedy past harms. 141
     For example, a suit to prevent tax officials from collecting death
taxes arising from the competing claims of two states as being the
last domicile of the decedent foundered upon the conclusion that
there could be no credible claim of violation of the Constitution or
federal law; state law imposed the obligation upon the officials and
“in reality” the action was against the state.142 Suits against state
officials to recover taxes have also been made increasingly difficult
to maintain. Although the Court long ago held that the sovereign
immunity of the state prevented a suit to recover money in the state
      137 Typically, the plaintiff would be in federal court under diversity jurisdiction,

cf. Martin v. Lankford, 245 U.S. 547, 551 (1918), perhaps under admiralty jurisdic-
tion, Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure Salvors, 458 U.S. 670 (1982), or under fed-
eral question jurisdiction. Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S.
635 (2002). In the last instance, federal courts are obligated first to consider whether
the issues presented may be decided on state law grounds before reaching federal
constitutional grounds, and thus relief may be afforded on state law grounds solely.
Cf. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., 213 U.S. 175, 193 (1909); Hagans v. Lavine,
415 U.S. 528, 546–47 & n.12 (1974). In a case removed from state court, presence of
a claim barred by the Eleventh Amendment does not destroy jurisdiction over non-
barred claims. Wisconsin Dep’t of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381 (1998).
      138 465 U.S. 89 (1984).
      139 Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 110 (1828).
      140 E.g., Ford Motor Co. v. Department of the Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464 (1945).
      141 In Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431 (2004), Texas, which was under a consent

decree regarding its state Medicaid program, attempted to extend the reasoning of
Pennhurst, arguing that unless an actual violation of federal law had been found by
a court, then such court would be without jurisdiction to enforce such decree. The
Court, in a unanimous opinion, declined to so extend the Eleventh Amendment, not-
ing, among other things, that the principles of federalism were served by giving state
officials the latitude and discretion to enter into enforceable consent decrees. Id. at
442.

Trust Co. v. Seattle, 271 U.S. 426 (1926). Worcester County remains viable. Cory v.
White, 457 U.S. 85 (1982). The actions were under the Federal Interpleader Act, 49
Stat. 1096 (1936), 28 U.S.C. § 1335, under which other actions against officials have
been allowed. E.g., Treines v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U.S. 66 (1939) (joinder of
state court judge and receiver in interpleader proceeding in which state had no in-
terest and neither judge nor receiver was enjoined by final decree). See also Mis-
souri v. Fiske, 290 U.S. 18 (1933).
