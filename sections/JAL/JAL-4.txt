a state was the party plaintiff.4 So matters stood when Congress,
in enacting the Judiciary Act of 1789, without recorded controversy
gave the Supreme Court original jurisdiction of suits between states
and citizens of other states.5 Chisholm v. Georgia was brought un-
der this jurisdictional provision to recover under a contract for sup-
plies executed with the state during the Revolution. Four of the five
Justices agreed that a state could be sued under this Article III ju-
risdictional provision and that under section 13 of the Act the Su-
preme Court properly had original jurisdiction.6
     The Amendment proposed by Congress and ratified by the states
was directed specifically toward overturning the result in Chisholm
and preventing suits against states by citizens of other states or by
citizens or subjects of foreign jurisdictions. It did not, as other pos-
sible versions of the Amendment would have done, altogether bar
suits against states in the federal courts.7 That is, it barred suits
against states based on the status of the party plaintiff and did not
address the instance of suits based on the nature of the subject mat-
ter.8
    The early decisions seemed to reflect this understanding of
the Amendment, although the point was not necessary to the de-
cisions and thus the language is dictum. 9 In Cohens v. Vir-
     4 The Convention adopted this provision largely as it came from the Committee

on Detail, without recorded debate. 2 M. FARRAND, THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVEN-
TION OF 1787 423–25 (rev. ed. 1937). In the Virginia ratifying convention, George Ma-
son, who had refused to sign the proposed Constitution, objected to making states
subject to suit, 3 J. ELLIOT, DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION
OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 526–27 (1836), but both Madison and John Marshall (the
latter had not been a delegate at Philadelphia) denied states could be made party
defendants, id. at 533, 555–56, while Randolph (who had been a delegate, as well as
a member of the Committee on Detail) granted that states could be and ought to be
subject to suit. Id. at 573. James Wilson, a delegate and member of the Committee
on Detail, seemed to say in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention that states would
be subject to suit. 2 id. at 491. See Hamilton, in THE FEDERALIST No. 81 (Modern Li-
brary ed. 1937), also denying state suability. See Fletcher, supra at 1045–53 (discuss-
ing sources and citing other discussions).

     8 Party status is one part of the Article III grant of jurisdiction, as in diversity

of citizenship of the parties; subject matter jurisdiction is the other part, as in fed-
eral question or admiralty jurisdiction.
     9 One square holding, however, was that of Justice Washington, on Circuit, in

United States v. Bright, 24 Fed. Cas. 1232 (C.C.D. Pa. 1809) (No. 14,647), that the
Eleventh Amendment’s reference to “any suit in law or equity” excluded admiralty
cases, so that states were subject to suits in admiralty. This understanding, see Gov-
ernor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 110, 124 (1828); 3 J. STORY, COMMENTAR-
