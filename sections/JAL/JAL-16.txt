ing that the entity was structured so as to take advantage of the
state’s constitutional protections.73
     Consent to Suit and Waiver.—The immunity of a state from
suit is a privilege which it may waive at its pleasure. A state may
expressly consent to being sued in federal court by statute.74 But
the conclusion that there has been consent or a waiver is not lightly
inferred; the Court strictly construes statutes alleged to consent to
suit. Thus, a state may waive its immunity in its own courts with-
out consenting to suit in federal court,75 and a general authoriza-
tion “to sue and be sued” is ordinarily insufficient to constitute con-
sent.76 “The Court will give effect to a State’s waiver of Eleventh
Amendment immunity ‘only where stated by the most express lan-
guage or by such overwhelming implication from the text as [will]
leave no room for any other reasonable construction.’ A State does
not waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity by consenting to suit
only in its own courts, and ‘[t]hus, in order for a state statute or
constitutional provision to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amend-
ment immunity, it must specify the State’s intention to subject it-
self to suit in federal court.’ ” 77
    Thus, in Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney,78 an ex-
pansive consent “to suits, actions, or proceedings of any form or na-
ture at law, in equity or otherwise” was deemed too “ambiguous and
general” to waive immunity in federal court, because it might be
interpreted to reflect only a state’s consent to suit in its own courts.
But, when combined with language specifying that consent was con-
ditioned on venue being laid “within a county or judicial district,
established by one of said States or by the United States, and situ-
ated wholly or partially within the Port of New York District,” waiver
was effective.79
