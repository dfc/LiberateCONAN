    Young arose when a state legislature passed a law reducing rail-
road rates and providing severe penalties for any railroad that failed
to comply with the law. Plaintiff railroad stockholders brought a fed-
eral action to enjoin Young, the state attorney general, from enforc-
ing the law, alleging that it was unconstitutional and that they would
suffer irreparable harm if he were not prevented from acting. An
injunction was granted forbidding Young from acting on the law,
an injunction he violated by bringing an action in state court against
noncomplying railroads; for this action he was adjudged in con-
tempt. If the Supreme Court had held that the injunction was not
permissible, because the suit was one against the state, there would
have been no practicable way for the railroads to attack the stat-
ute without placing themselves in great danger. They could have
disobeyed it and alleged its unconstitutionality as a defense in en-
forcement proceedings, but if they were wrong about the statute’s
validity the penalties would have been devastating.116 On the other
hand, effectuating constitutional rights through an injunction would
not have been possible had the injunction been deemed to be a suit
against the state.
     In deciding Young, the Court faced inconsistent lines of cases,
including numerous precedents for permitting suits against state
officers. Chief Justice Marshall had begun the process in Osborn
by holding that suit was barred only when the state was formally
named a party.117 He presently was required to modify that deci-
sion and preclude suit when an official, the governor of a state, was
sued in his official capacity,118 but relying on Osborn and reading
Madrazo narrowly, the Court later held in a series of cases that an
official of a state could be sued to prevent him from executing a
state law in conflict with the Constitution or a law of the United
States, and the fact that the officer may be acting on behalf of the
state or in response to a statutory obligation of the state did not
make the suit one against the state.119 Another line of cases began
developing a more functional, less formalistic concept of the Elev-
enth Amendment and sovereign immunity, one that evidenced an
increasing wariness toward affirmatively ordering states to relin-

    116 In fact, the statute was eventually held to be constitutional. Minnesota Rate
