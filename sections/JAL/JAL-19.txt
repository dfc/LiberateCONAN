    In the 1989 case of Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.,92 the Court—
temporarily at least—ended years of uncertainty by holding ex-
pressly that Congress acting pursuant to its Article I powers (as
opposed to its Fourteenth Amendment powers) may abrogate the
Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states, so long as it does so
with sufficient clarity. Twenty-five years earlier the Court had stated
that same principle,93 but only as an alternative holding, and a later
case had set forth a more restrictive rule.94 The premises of Union
Gas were that by consenting to ratification of the Constitution, with
its Commerce Clause and other clauses empowering Congress and
limiting the states, the states had implicitly authorized Congress
to divest them of immunity, that the Eleventh Amendment was a
restraint upon the courts and not similarly upon Congress, and that
the exercises of Congress’s powers under the Commerce Clause and
other clauses would be incomplete without the ability to authorize
damage actions against the states to enforce congressional enact-
ments. The dissenters disputed each of these strands of the argu-
ment, and, while recognizing the Fourteenth Amendment abroga-
tion power, would have held that no such power existed under Article
I.


the term “person” for the purpose of subjecting them to suit. The question arose
after Monell v. New York City Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), reinter-
preted “person” to include municipal corporations. Cf. Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S.
781 (1978). The Court has reserved the question whether the Fourteenth Amend-
ment itself, without congressional action, modifies the Eleventh Amendment to per-
mit suits against states, Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 290 n.23 (1977), but the
result in Milliken, holding that the Governor could be enjoined to pay half the cost
of providing compensatory education for certain schools, which would come from the
state treasury, and in Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974), permitting imposition
of damages upon the governor, which would come from the state treasury, is sugges-
tive. But see Mauclet v. Nyquist, 406 F. Supp. 1233 (W.D.N.Y. 1976) (refusing money
damages under the Fourteenth Amendment), appeal dismissed sub nom. Rabinovitch
v. Nyquist, 433 U.S. 901 (1977). The Court declined in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.
123, 150 (1908), to view the Eleventh Amendment as modified by the Fourteenth.
     92 491 U.S. 1 (1989). The plurality opinion of the Court was by Justice Brennan

and was joined by the three other Justices who believed Hans was incorrectly de-
cided. See id. at 23 (Justice Stevens concurring). The fifth vote was provided by Jus-
tice White, id. at 45, 55–56 (Justice White concurring), although he believed Hans
was correctly decided and ought to be maintained and although he did not believe
Congress had acted with sufficient clarity in the statutes before the Court to abro-
gate immunity. Justice Scalia thought the statutes were express enough but that
Congress simply lacked the power. Id. at 29. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices
O’Connor and Kennedy joined relevant portions of both opinions finding lack of power
and lack of clarity.
