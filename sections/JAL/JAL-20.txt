     Pennsylvania v. Union Gas lasted less than seven years before
the Court overruled it in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida.95 Chief
Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5–4 majority, concluded Union Gas
had deviated from a line of cases, tracing back to Hans v. Louisi-
ana,96 that viewed the Eleventh Amendment as implementing the
“fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant
of judicial authority in Article III.” 97 Because “the Eleventh Amend-
ment restricts the judicial power under Article III, . . . Article I can-
not be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon
federal jurisdiction.” 98 Subsequent cases have upheld this interpre-
tation.99
    Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, of course, is another
matter. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,100 which was “based upon a rationale
wholly inapplicable to the Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that
the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted well after the adoption of the
Eleventh Amendment and the ratification of the Constitution, oper-
ated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and federal power
achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment,” remains good
law.101 This ruling has led to a significant number of cases that ex-
amined whether a statute that might be applied against non-state
actors under an Article I power, could also, under section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, be applied against the states.102
     95 517 U.S. 44 (1996) (invalidating a provision of the Indian Gaming Regulatory

Act authorizing an Indian tribe to sue a state in federal court to compel perfor-
mance of a duty to negotiate in good faith toward the formation of a compact).
     96 134 U.S. 1 (1890).
     97 517 U.S. at 64 (quoting Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465

U.S. 89, 97–98 (1984).
     98 517 U.S. at 72–73. Justice Souter’s dissent undertook a lengthy refutation of

the majority’s analysis, asserting that the Eleventh Amendment is best understood,
in keeping with its express language, as barring only suits based on diversity of
citizenship, and as having no application to federal question litigation. Moreover,
Justice Souter contended, the state sovereign immunity that the Court mistakenly
recognized in Hans v. Louisiana was a common law concept that “had no constitu-
tional status and was subject to congressional abrogation.” 517 U.S. at 117. The Con-
stitution made no provision for wholesale adoption of the common law, but, on the
contrary, was premised on the view that common law rules would always be subject
to legislative alteration. This “imperative of legislative control grew directly out of
the Framers’ revolutionary idea of popular sovereignty.” Id. at 160.

the Lanham Act, did not validly abrogate state immunity); Florida Prepaid Postsec-
ondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627 (1999) (amend-
ment to patent laws abrogating state immunity from infringement suits is invalid);
