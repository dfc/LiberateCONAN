language,108 and in at least one context, has eliminated the require-
ment of specific abrogation language altogether.109
    Even before the decision in Alden v. Maine,110 when the Court
believed that Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity did not ap-
ply to suits in state courts, the Court applied its rule of strict con-
struction to require “unmistakable clarity” by Congress in order to
subject states to suit.111 Although the Court was willing to recog-
nize exceptions to the clear statement rule when the issue involved
subjection of states to suit in state courts, the Court also suggested
the need for “symmetry” so that states’ liability or immunity would
be the same in both state and federal courts.112
Suits Against State Officials
    Courts may open their doors for relief against government wrongs
under the doctrine that sovereign immunity does not prevent a suit
to restrain individual officials, thereby restraining the government
as well.113 The doctrine is built upon a double fiction: that for pur-
poses of the sovereign’s immunity, a suit against an official is not a
suit against the government, but for the purpose of finding state
action to which the Constitution applies, the official’s conduct is that
of the state.114 The doctrine preceded but is most noteworthily asso-
ciated with the decision in Ex parte Young,115 a case that deserves
the overworked adjective, seminal.
     108 Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 74–78 (2000). In Kimel, statu-

tory language authorized age discrimination suits “against any employer (including
a public agency),” and a “public agency” was defined to include “the government of a
State or political subdivision thereof.” The Court found this language to be suffi-
ciently clear evidence of intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity. The relevant
portion of the opinion was written by Justice O’Connor, and joined by Chief Justice
Rehnquist and Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, Ginsberg, Breyer and Stevens. But
see Raygor v. Regents of the University of Minnesota, 534 U.S. 533 (2002) (federal
supplemental jurisdiction statute which tolls limitations period for state claims dur-
ing pendency of federal case not applicable to claim dismissed on the basis of Elev-
enth Amendment immunity).

gation of state sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause was effectuated
by the Constitution, so it need not additionally be done by statute); id. at 383 (Jus-
tice Thomas dissenting).

and state officials sued in their official capacity could not be made defendants in
§ 1983 actions in state courts).
     112 Hilton v. South Carolina Pub. Rys. Comm’n, 502 U.S. 197, 206 (1991) (inter-

est in “symmetry” is outweighed by stare decisis, the FELA action being controlled
by Parden v. Terminal Ry.).
     113 See, e.g., Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682 (1949), where

the majority and dissenting opinions cite both federal and Eleventh Amendment cases
in a suit against a federal official. See also Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204, 213 (1897),
applying to the states the federal rule of United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882).
