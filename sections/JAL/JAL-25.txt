    Although Ayers was in all relevant points on all fours with
Young,128 the Young Court held that the injunction had properly is-
sued against the state attorney general, even though the state was
in effect restrained as well. “The act to be enforced is alleged to be
unconstitutional, and, if it be so, the use of the name of the State
to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury of the complainants
is a proceeding without the authority of and one which does not
affect the State in its sovereign or governmental capacity. It is sim-
ply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting by
the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment
which is void because unconstitutional. If the act which the state
Attorney General seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federal Con-
stitution, the officer in proceeding under such enactment comes into
conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is
in that case stripped of his official or representative character and
is subject in his person to the consequences of his individual con-
duct.” 129 Justice Harlan was the only dissenter, arguing that in law
and fact the suit was one only against the state and that the suit
against the individual was a mere “fiction.” 130


tract; but, in any event, because any violation of the assumed contract was an act of
the state, to which the officials were not parties, their actions as individuals in bring-
ing suit did not breach the contract. 123 U.S. at 503, 505–06. The rationale had
been asserted by a four-Justice concurrence in Antoni v. Greenhow, 107 U.S. 769,
783 (1882). See also Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R.R., 109 U.S. 446 (1883);
Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52 (1886); North Carolina v. Temple, 134 U.S. 22 (1890);
In re Tyler, 149 U.S. 164 (1893); Baltzer v. North Carolina, 161 U.S. 240 (1896);

      128 Ayers “would seem to be decisive of the Young litigation.” C. WRIGHT, THE LAW

OF FEDERAL COURTS § 48 at 288 (4th ed. 1983). The Young Court purported to distin-
guish and to preserve Ayers but on grounds that either were irrelevant to Ayers or
that had been rejected in the earlier case. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 151, 167
(1908). Similarly, in a later case, the Court continued to distinguish Ayers but on
grounds that did not in fact distinguish it from the case before the Court, in which
it permitted a suit against a state revenue commissioner to enjoin him from collect-
ing allegedly unconstitutional taxes. Georgia R.R. & Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342
U.S. 299 (1952).
      129 Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159–60 (1908). The opinion did not address

the issue of how an officer “stripped of his official . . . character” could violate the
Constitution, in that the Constitution restricts only “state action,” but the double
fiction has been expounded numerous times since. Thus, for example, it is well settled
that an action unauthorized by state law is state action for purposes of the Four-
teenth Amendment. Home Tel. & Tel. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 227 U.S. 278 (1913).
The contrary premise of Barney v. City of New York, 193 U.S. 430 (1904), though
eviscerated by Home Tel. & Tel. was not expressly disavowed until United States v.
Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 25–26 (1960).
      130 Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 173–74 (1908). In the process of limiting ap-

plication of Young, a Court majority referred to “the Young fiction.” Idaho v. Coeur
d’Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 281 (1997).
