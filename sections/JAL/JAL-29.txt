those wrongfully denied the funds in the past “is in practical effect
indistinguishable in many aspects from an award of damages against
the State.” 150
     That Edelman in many instances will be a formal restriction
rather than an actual one is illustrated by Milliken v. Bradley,151
in which state officers were ordered to spend money from the state
treasury in order to finance remedial educational programs to coun-
teract the effects of past school segregation; the decree, the Court
said, “fits squarely within the prospective-compliance exception re-
affirmed by Edelman.” 152 Although the payments were a result of
past wrongs, of past constitutional violations, the Court did not view
them as “compensation,” inasmuch as they were not to be paid to
victims of past discrimination but rather used to better conditions
either for them or their successors.153 The Court also applied Edel-
man in Papasan v. Allain,154 holding that a claim against a state
for payments representing a continuing obligation to meet trust re-
sponsibilities stemming from a 19th century grant of public lands
for benefit of education of the Chickasaw Indian Nation is barred
by the Eleventh Amendment as indistinguishable from an action
for past loss of trust corpus, but that an Equal Protection claim for
present unequal distribution of school land funds is the type of on-
going violation for which the Eleventh Amendment does not bar re-
dress.
     In Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe,155 the Court further narrowed
Ex parte Young. The implications of the case are difficult to predict,
because of the narrowness of the Court’s holding, the closeness of
the vote (5–4), and the inability of the majority to agree on a ratio-
nale. The holding was that the Tribe’s suit against state officials
for a declaratory judgment and injunction to establish the Tribe’s
ownership and control of the submerged lands of Lake Coeur d’Alene
     150 415 U.S. at 668. See also Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979) (reaffirming

Edelman, but holding that state officials could be ordered to notify members of the
class that had been denied retroactive relief in that case that they might seek back
benefits by invoking state administrative procedures; the order did not direct the
payment but left it to state discretion to award retroactive relief). But cf. Green v.
Mansour, 474 U.S. 64 (1985). “Notice relief ” permitted under Quern v. Jordan is
consistent with the Eleventh Amendment only insofar as it is ancillary to valid pro-
spective relief designed to prevent ongoing violations of federal law. Thus, where
Congress has changed the AFDC law and the state is complying with the new law,
an order to state officials to notify claimants that past payments may have been
inadequate conflicts with the Eleventh Amendment.
