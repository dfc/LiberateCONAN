    The agency sought access to records of state-run hospitals in
federal court. Six Justices upheld the effort: The relief sought was
straightforward and prospective, and not a burdensome encroach-
ment on state sovereignty.161
    Thus, as with the cases dealing with suits facially against the
states themselves, the Court’s greater attention to state immunity
in the context of suits against state officials has resulted in a mixed
picture, of some new restrictions, of the lessening of others. But a
number of Justices have increasingly resorted to the Eleventh Amend-
ment as a means to reduce federal-state judicial conflict.162 One may,
therefore, expect this to be a continuingly contentious area.
     Tort Actions Against State Officials.—In Tindal v. Wes-
ley,163 the Court adopted the rule of United States v. Lee,164 a tort
suit against federal officials, to permit a tort action against state
officials to recover real property held by them and claimed by the
state and to obtain damages for the period of withholding. The im-
munity of a state from suit has long been held not to extend to
actions against state officials for damages arising out of willful and
negligent disregard of state laws.165 The reach of the rule is evi-
dent in Scheuer v. Rhodes,166 in which the Court held that plain-
tiffs were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment or other immu-
nity doctrines from suing the governor and other officials of a state
alleging that they deprived plaintiffs of federal rights under color
of state law and seeking damages, when it was clear that plaintiffs
were seeking to impose individual and personal liability on the of-
ficials. There was no “executive immunity” from suit, the Court held;
rather, the immunity of state officials is qualified and varies accord-
ing to the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the particular
office and the circumstances existing at the time the challenged ac-
tion was taken.167

     161 In a concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Thomas, contin-

ued to support a case-by-case balancing analysis. Virginia Office for Protection and
Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. ___, No. 09–529, slip op. (2011) (Kennedy, J., concur-
ring).
     162 See, e.g., Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure Salvors, 458 U.S. 670, 702 (1982)

(dissenting opinion); Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 520 (1982)
(dissenting opinion). See also Employees of the Dep’t of Public Health and Welfare
v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279 (1973).

     167 These suits, like suits against local officials and municipal corporations, are

typically brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and typically involve all the deci-
sions respecting liability and immunities thereunder. On the scope of immunity of
federal officials, see Article III, “Suits Against United States Officials,” supra.
