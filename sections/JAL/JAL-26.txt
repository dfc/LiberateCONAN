    The “fiction” remains a mainstay of our jurisprudence.131 It ac-
counts for a great deal of the litigation brought by individuals to
challenge the carrying out of state policies. Suits against state offi-
cers alleging that they are acting pursuant to an unconstitutional
statute are the standard device by which to test the validity of state
legislation in federal courts prior to enforcement and thus interpre-
tation in the state courts.132 Similarly, suits to restrain state offi-
cials from taking certain actions in contravention of federal stat-
utes 133 or to compel the undertaking of affirmative obligations imposed
by the Constitution or federal laws 134 are common.
    For years, moreover, the accepted rule was that suits pros-
ecuted against state officers in federal courts upon grounds that they
are acting in excess of state statutory authority 135 or that they are
not doing something required by state law 136 are not precluded by
the Eleventh Amendment or its emanations of sovereign immunity,

     131 E.g., Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 156 n.6 (1978) (rejecting

request of state officials being sued to restrain enforcement of state statute as pre-
empted by federal law that Young be overruled); Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure
Salvors, 458 U.S. 670, 685 (1982).
     132 See, e.g., Home Tel. & Tel. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, 227 U.S. 278 (1913);

Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33 (1915); Cavanaugh v. Looney, 248 U.S. 453 (1919); Ter-
race v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197 (1923); Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U.S.
497 (1925); Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, 272 U.S. 525 (1926); Hawks v.
Hamill, 288 U.S. 52 (1933). See also Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971)
(enjoining state welfare officials from denying welfare benefits to otherwise qualified
recipients because they were aliens); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970) (enjoin-
ing city welfare officials from following state procedures for termination of benefits);
Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267 (1977) (imposing half the costs of mandated com-
pensatory education programs upon state through order directed to governor and
other officials). On injunctions against governors, see Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring,
286 U.S. 352 (1932); Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932). Applicable to suits
under this doctrine are principles of judicial restraint—constitutional, statutory, and
prudential—discussed under Article III.
     133 E.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664–68 (1974); Ray v. Atlantic Richfield

Co., 435 U.S. 151 (1978).
     134 E.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267 (1977); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S.

651, 664–68 (1974); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 346–49 (1979).
     135 E.g., Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1 (1891); Scully v. Bird, 209 U.S.

481 (1908); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. v. O’Connor, 223 U.S. 280 (1912); Greene v. Lou-
isville & Interurban R.R., 244 U.S. 499 (1977); Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Greene,
244 U.S. 522 (1917). Property held by state officials on behalf of the state under
claimed state authority may be recovered in suits against the officials, although the
court may not conclusively resolve the state’s claims against it in such a suit. South
Carolina v. Wesley, 155 U.S. 542 (1895); Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204 (1897); Hopkins
v. Clemson College, 221 U.S. 636 (1911). See also Florida Dep’t of State v. Treasure
Salvors, 458 U.S. 670 (1982), in which the eight Justices who agreed that the Elev-
enth Amendment applied divided 4-to-4 over the proper interpretation.
     136 E.g., Rolston v. Missouri Fund Comm’rs, 120 U.S. 390 (1887); Atchison, T. &

S. F. Ry. v. O’Connor, 223 U.S. 280 (1912); Johnson v. Lankford, 245 U.S. 541, 545
(1918); Lankford v. Platte Iron Works Co., 235 U.S. 461, 471 (1915); Davis v. Wal-
lace, 257 U.S. 478, 482–85 (1922); Glenn v. Field Packing Co., 290 U.S. 177, 178
(1933); Lee v. Bickell, 292 U.S. 415, 425 (1934).
