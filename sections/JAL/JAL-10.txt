of Florida v. Florida,35 that Congress lacks the power under Article
I to abrogate state immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, and
with its ruling in Alden v. Maine 36 that the broad principle of sov-
ereign immunity reflected in the Eleventh Amendment bars suits
against states in state courts as well as federal.
    Having previously reserved the question of whether federal statu-
tory rights could be enforced in state courts,37 the Court in Alden v.
Maine 38 held that states could also assert Eleventh Amendment “sov-
ereign immunity” in their own courts. Recognizing that the applica-
tion of the Eleventh Amendment, which limits only the federal courts,
was a “misnomer” 39 as applied to state courts, the Court nonethe-
less concluded that the principles of common law sovereign immu-
nity applied absent “compelling evidence” that the states had sur-
rendered such by the ratification of the Constitution. Although this
immunity is subject to the same limitations as apply in federal courts,
the Court’s decision effectively limited the application of significant
portions of federal law to state governments. Both Seminole Tribe
and Alden were also 5–4 decisions with the four dissenting Jus-
tices maintaining that Hans was wrongly decided.
    This now-institutionalized 5–4 split continued with Federal Mari-
time Commission v. South Carolina State Ports Authority,40 which
held that state sovereign immunity also applies to quasi-judicial pro-
ceedings in federal agencies. The operator of a cruise ship devoted
to gambling had been denied entry to the Port of Charleston, and
subsequently filed a complaint with the Federal Maritime Commis-
sion, alleging a violation of the Shipping Act of 1984.41 Justice Breyer,
writing for the four dissenting justices, emphasized the executive
(as opposed to judicial nature) of such agency adjudications, and
pointed out that the ultimate enforcement of such proceedings in
federal court was exercised by a federal agency (as is allowed un-
der the doctrine of sovereign immunity). The majority, however, while
admitting to a “relatively barren historical record,” presumed that
when a proceeding was “unheard of ” at the time of the founding of
