the Constitution, it could not subsequently be applied in deroga-
tion of a “State’s dignity” within our system of federalism.42

The Nature of the States’ Immunity
    A great deal of the difficulty in interpreting and applying the
Eleventh Amendment stems from the fact that the Court has not
been clear, or at least has not been consistent, with respect to what
the Amendment really does and how it relates to the other parts of
the Constitution. One view of the Amendment, set out above in the
discussion of Hans v. Louisiana, Ex parte New York, and Principal-
ity of Monaco, is that Chisholm was erroneously decided and that
the Amendment’s effect, its express language notwithstanding, was
to restore the “original understanding” that Article III’s grants of
federal court jurisdiction did not extend to suits against the states.
That view finds present day expression.43 It explains the decision
in Edelman v. Jordan,44 in which the Court held that a state could
properly raise its Eleventh Amendment defense on appeal after hav-
ing defended and lost on the merits in the trial court. “[I]t has been
well settled . . . that the Eleventh Amendment defense sufficiently
partakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar so that it need not be
raised in the trial court.” 45 But that the bar is not wholly jurisdic-
tional seems established as well.46
    Moreover, if under Article III there is no jurisdiction of suits
against states, the settled principle that states may consent to suit 47
becomes conceptually difficult, as it is not possible to confer jurisdic-
tion where it is lacking through the consent of the parties.48 And
there is jurisdiction under Article III of some suits against states,
    42   535 U.S. at 755, 760.
    43   E.g., Employees of the Dep’t of Public Health and Welfare v. Department of
Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 291–92 (1973) (Justice Marshall concur-
ring); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 420–21 (1979); Patsy v. Florida Board of Re-
gents, 457 U.S. 496, 520 (1982) (Justice Powell dissenting); Seminole Tribe of Florida
v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 64 (1996).
      44 415 U.S. 651 (1974).
      45 415 U.S. at 678. The Court relied on Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Trea-

sury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459 (1945), where the issue was whether state officials
who had voluntarily appeared in federal court had authority under state law to waive
the state’s immunity. Edelman has been followed in Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393,
396 n.2 (1975); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 278 (1977),
with respect to the Court’s responsibility to raise the Eleventh Amendment jurisdic-
tional issue on its own motion.
      46 See Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 515–16 n.19 (1982), in

which the Court bypassed the Eleventh Amendment issue, which had been brought
to its attention, because of the interest of the parties in having the question re-
solved on the merits. See id. at 520 (Justice Powell dissenting).
      47 Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436 (1883).
      48 E.g., People’s Band v. Calhoun, 102 U.S. 256, 260–61 (1880). See Justice Pow-

ell’s explanation in Patsy v. Florida Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 528 n.13 (1982)
(dissenting) (no jurisdiction under Article III of suits against unconsenting states).
