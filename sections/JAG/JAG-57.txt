     As to attorney competence, although the Court touched on the
question in 1970,319 it did not articulate a general Sixth Amend-
ment standard for adequacy of representation until 1984 in Strickland
v. Washington.320 There are two components to the Strickland test:
deficient representation and resulting prejudice to the defense so
serious as to bring the outcome of the proceeding into question.321
The gauge of deficient representation is an objective standard of rea-
sonableness “under prevailing professional norms” that takes into
account “all the circumstances” and evaluates conduct “from coun-
sel’s perspective at the time.” 322 Providing effective assistance is not
limited to a single path. No detailed rules or guidelines for ad-
equate representation are appropriate: “Any such set of rules would
interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of coun-
sel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tac-
tical decisions.” 323

535 U.S. 162 (2002). For earlier cases presenting more direct violations of defen-
dant’s rights, see Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60 (1942); United States v. Hay-
man, 342 U.S. 205 (1952); and Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674 (1958).
     319 In McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 768–71 (1970), the Court observed

that whether defense counsel provided adequate representation, in advising a guilty
plea, depended not on whether a court would retrospectively consider his advice right
or wrong “but on whether that advice was within the range of competence de-
manded of attorneys in criminal cases.” See also Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258,
266–69 (1973); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 (1976).
     320 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Strickland involved capital sentencing, and the Court

had left open the since-resolved issue of what standards might apply in ordinary
sentencing, where there is generally far more discretion than in capital sentencing,
or in the guilt/innocence phase of a capital trial. 466 U.S. at 686.
     321 The Court often emphasizes that the Strckland test is necessarily difficult to

pass: Ineffective assistance of counsel claims can put rules of waiver and forfeiture
at issue and otherwise threaten the integrity of the adversarial system if wide-
ranging, after-the-fact second-guessing of counsel’s action is freely encouraged. E.g.,
Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–587, slip op. at 15 (2011). Furthermore,
ineffective assistance of counsel claims frequently are asserted in federal court to
support petitions for writs of habeas corpus filed by state prisoners. Making a suc-
cessful Strickland claim in a habeas context, as opposed to direct review, was made
doubly daunting by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).
Pub. L. No. 104–132, § 104, 110 Stat. 1218–1219, amending 28 U.S.C. § 2254. After
the passage of AEDPA, one must go beyond showing that a state court applied fed-
eral law incorrectly to also show that the court misapplied established Supreme Court
precedent in a manner that no fair-minded jurist could find to be reasonable. Har-
rington v. Richter, 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–587, slip op. at 10–14, 15–16 (counsel’s deci-
sion to forgo inquiry into blood evidence held to be at least arguably reasonable).
See also Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. ___, No. 09–1088, slip op. at 15–16 (2011).
     322 466 U.S. at 688, 689.
     323 466 U.S. at 689. Strickland observed that “American Bar Association stan-

dards and the like” may reflect prevailing norms of practice, “but they are only guides.”
Id. at 688. Subsequent cases also cite ABA standards as touchstones of prevailing
norms of practice. E.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003), and Rompilla v.
Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387 (2005). But in Bobby v. Van Hook, the Court held that the
Sixth Circuit had erred in assessing an attorney’s conduct in the 1980s under 2003
