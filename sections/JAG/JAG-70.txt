he need not stand alone against the State at any stage of the pros-
ecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s ab-
sence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” 390 Coun-
sel’s presence at a lineup is constitutionally necessary because the
lineup stage is filled with numerous possibilities for errors, both in-
advertent and intentional, which cannot adequately be discovered
and remedied at trial.391 However, because there was less certainty
and frequency of possible injustice at this stage, the Court held that
the two cases were to be given prospective effect only; more egre-
gious instances, where identification had been based upon lineups
conducted in a manner that was unnecessarily suggestive and con-
ducive to irreparable mistaken identification, could be invalidated
under the Due Process Clause.392 The Wade-Gilbert rule is inappli-
cable to other methods of obtaining identification and other evidentiary
material relating to the defendant, such as blood samples, handwrit-
ing exemplars, and the like, because there is minimal risk that the
absence of counsel might derogate from the defendant’s right to a
fair trial.393
     In United States v. Ash,394 the Court redefined and modified its
“critical stage” analysis. According to the Court, the “core purpose”
of the guarantee of counsel is to assure assistance at trial “when
the accused was confronted with both the intricacies of the law and
the advocacy of the public prosecutor.” But assistance would be less
than meaningful in the light of developments in criminal investiga-
tion and procedure if it were limited to the formal trial itself; there-
fore, counsel is compelled at “pretrial events that might appropri-
ately be considered to be parts of the trial itself. At these newly
emerging and significant events, the accused was confronted, just
as at trial, by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or
by both.” 395 Therefore, unless the pretrial stage involved the physi-

“The fundamental premise underlying all of this Court’s decisions holding the right
to counsel applicable at ‘critical’ pretrial proceedings, is that a ‘stage’ of the prosecu-
tion must be deemed ‘critical’ for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment if it is one
at which the presence of counsel is necessary ‘to protect the fairness of the trial
itself.’ ” Id. at 339 (Justice Brennan dissenting). Examination of defendant by court-
