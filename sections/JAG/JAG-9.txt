provide a public demonstration of fairness; they discourage perjury,
the misconduct of participants, and decisions based on secret bias
or partiality. Open trials educate the public about the criminal jus-
tice system, give legitimacy to it, and have the prophylactic effect
of enabling the public to see justice done.34 Though the Sixth Amend-
ment expressly grants the accused a right to a public trial,35 the
Court has found the right to be so fundamental to the fairness of
the adversary system that it is independently protected against state
deprivation by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment.36 The First Amendment right of public access to court pro-
ceedings also weighs in favor of openness.37
    The Court has borrowed from First Amendment cases in protect-
ing the right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment. Closure
of trials or pretrial proceedings over the objection of the accused
may be justified only if the state can show “an overriding interest
based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher val-
ues and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.” 38 In Waller v.
Georgia,39 the Court held that an accused’s Sixth Amendment rights
had been violated by closure of all 7 days of a suppression hearing
in order to protect persons whose phone conversations had been taped,
when less than 2½ hours of the hearing had been devoted to play-
ing the tapes. The need for openness at suppression hearings “may
be particularly strong,” the Court indicated, because the conduct of
police and prosecutor is often at issue.40 Relying on Waller and First
Amendment precedent, the Court similarly held that an accused’s
Sixth Amendment right to a public trial had been violated when a

     34 Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 569–73 (1980) (plurality opin-

ion of Chief Justice Burger); id. at 593–97 (Justice Brennan concurring).
     35 Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 538–39 (1965).
     36 In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257 (1948); Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610 (1960).

Both cases were contempt proceedings which were not then “criminal prosecutions”
to which the Sixth Amendment applied (for the modern rule see Bloom v. Illinois,
391 U.S. 194 (1968)), so that the cases were wholly due process holdings. Cf. Rich-
mond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 591 n.16 (1980) (Justice Brennan con-
curring).
     37 The Court found a qualified First Amendment right for the public to attend

criminal trials in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia. 448 U.S. 555 (1980) (opinion of
Chief Justice Burger); id. at 582 (Justice Stevens concurring); id. at 584 (Justice
Brennan concurring); id. at 598 (Justice Stewart concurring); id. at 601 (Justice
Blackmun concurring). See First Amendment, “Government and the Conduct of Tri-
als,” supra.
