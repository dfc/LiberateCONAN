derlying basis for Miranda v. Arizona 401 left that case basically un-
affected by Kirby, but it appears that Escobedo v. Illinois,402 and
perhaps other cases, is greatly restricted thereby.
    Post-Conviction Proceedings.—The right to counsel under the
Sixth Amendment applies to “criminal prosecutions,” a restriction
that limits its scope but does not exhaust all constitutional rights
to representation in adversarial contexts associated with the crimi-
nal justice process. The Sixth Amendment requires counsel at the
sentencing stage,403 and the Court has held that, where sentencing
was deferred after conviction and the defendant was placed on pro-
bation, he must be afforded counsel at a hearing on revocation of
probation and imposition of the deferred sentence.404 Beyond this,
however, the Court has eschewed Sixth Amendment analysis, in-
stead delimiting the right to counsel under due process and equal
protection principles.405
     Noncriminal and Investigatory Proceedings.—Commit-
ment proceedings that lead to the imposition of essentially crimi-
nal punishment are subject to the Due Process Clause and require
the assistance of counsel.406 A state administrative investigation by
a fire marshal inquiring into the causes of a fire was held not to be

dissented in Wade and Gilbert, dissented in Kirby simply on the basis that those
two cases controlled this one. Id. at 705. Indictment, as the quotation from Kirby
indicates, is not a necessary precondition. Any initiation of judicial proceedings suf-
fices. E.g., Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977) (suspect had been seized pursu-
ant to an arrest warrant, arraigned, and committed by court); United States v. Gouveia,
467 U.S. 180 (1984) (Sixth Amendment attaches as of arraignment—there is no right
to counsel for prison inmates placed under administrative segregation during a lengthy
investigation of their participation in prison crimes).
     401 “[T]he Miranda decision was based exclusively upon the Fifth and Four-

teenth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, upon the theory
that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.” 406 U.S. at 688 (emphasis by
Court).
     402 “But Escobedo is not apposite here for two distinct reasons. First, the Court

in retrospect perceived that the ‘prime purpose’ of Escobedo was not to vindicate the
constitutional right to counsel as such, but, like Miranda, ‘to guarantee full effectua-
tion of the privilege against self-incrimination. . . .’ Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S.
719, 729. Secondly, and perhaps even more important for purely practical purposes,
the Court has limited the holding of Escobedo to its own facts, Johnson v. New Jer-
sey, supra, at 733–34, and those facts are not remotely akin to the facts of the case
before us.” 406 U.S. at 689. But see id. at 693 n.3 (Justice Brennan dissenting).
     403 Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736 (1948).
     404 Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128 (1967) (applied retroactively in McConnell v.

Rhay, 393 U.S. 2 (1968)).
     405 State criminal appeals, applications for collateral relief, and post-sentencing

parole or probation determinations are examples of procedures with respect to which
the Court has not invoked the Sixth Amendment. Using due process analysis, the
Court has found no constitutional right to counsel in prison disciplinary proceed-
ings. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 560–70 (1974); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425
U.S. 308, 314–15 (1976). See Fourteenth Amendment, “Rights of Prisoners,” infra.
     406 Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605 (1967).
