statement by a witness who is under oath, in the presence of the
jury, and subject to cross-examination by the defendant is only one
way of complying with the Confrontation Clause, four Justices con-
cluded. Thus, at least in the absence of prosecutorial misconduct or
negligence and where the evidence is not “crucial” or “devastating,”
these Justices found that the Confrontation Clause could be satis-
fied if “the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the
truth of the [hearsay] statement.” The reliability of a statement was
to be ascertained in each case by an inquiry into the likelihood that
cross-examination of the declarant at trial could successfully call
into question the declaration’s apparent meaning or the declarant’s
sincerity, perception, or memory.218
    In Ohio v. Roberts,219 a Court majority adopted a reliability test
for satisfying the confrontation requirement through use of a state-
ment by an unavailable witness.220 Over the course of 24 years, Rob-
erts was applied, narrowed,221 and finally overruled in Crawford v.
     218 400 U.S. at 86–89. The quoted phrase is at 89, (quoting California v. Green,

399 U.S. 149, 161 (1970)). Justice Harlan concurred to carry the case, on the view
that (1) the Confrontation Clause requires only that any testimony actually given at
trial must be subject to cross-examination, but (2) in the absence of countervailing
circumstances introduction of prior recorded testimony—“trial by affidavit”—would
violate the clause. Id. at 93, 95, 97. Justices Marshall, Black, Douglas, and Brennan
dissented, id. at 100, arguing for adoption of a rule that: “The incriminatory extrajudicial
statement of an alleged accomplice is so inherently prejudicial that it cannot be in-
troduced unless there is an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, whether or
not his statement falls within a genuine exception to the hearsay rule.” Id. at 110–
11. The Clause protects defendants against use of substantive evidence against them,
but does not bar rebuttal of the defendant’s own testimony. Tennessee v. Street, 471
U.S. 409 (1985) (use of accomplice’s confession not to establish facts as to defen-
dant’s participation in the crime, but instead to support officer’s rebuttal of defen-
dant’s testimony as to circumstances of defendant’s confession; presence of officer
assured right of cross-examination).
     219 448 U.S. 56 (1980). The witness was absent from home and her parents tes-

tified they did not know where she was or how to get in touch with her. The state’s
sole effort to locate her was to deliver a series of subpoenas to her parents’ home.
Over the objection of three dissenters, the Court held this to be an adequate basis
to demonstrate her unavailability. Id. at 74–77.
     220 “[O]nce a witness is shown to be unavailable . . . , the Clause countenances

only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that ‘there is no material departure
from the reason of the general rule.’ ” 448 U.S. at 65 (quoting Snyder v. Massachu-
setts, 291 U.S. 97, 107 (1934)). The Court indicated that reliability could be inferred
without more if the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.
     221 Applying Roberts, the Court held that the fact that defendant’s and codefen-

dant’s confessions “interlocked” on a number of points was not a sufficient indicium
of reliability, since the confessions diverged on the critical issues of the respective
roles of the two defendants. Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530 (1986). Roberts was nar-
rowed in United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387 (1986), which held that the rule of
“necessity” is confined to use of testimony from a prior judicial proceeding, and is
inapplicable to co-conspirators’ out-of-court statements. See also White v. Illinois, 502
U.S. 346, 357 (1992) (holding admissible “evidence embraced within such firmly rooted
exceptions to the hearsay rule as those for spontaneous declarations and statements
made for medical treatment”); and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 822–23 (1990) (in-
