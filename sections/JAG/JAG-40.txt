Washington.222 The Court in Crawford rejected reliance on “particu-
larized guarantees of trustworthiness” as inconsistent with the re-
quirements of the Confrontation Clause. The Clause “commands, not
that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a par-
ticular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.” 223
Reliability is an “amorphous” concept that is “manipulable,” and the
Roberts test had been applied “to admit core testimonial state-
ments that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.” 224
“Where testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of
reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the
Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.” 225
     Crawford represented a decisive turning point by clearly stat-
ing the basic principles to be used in Confrontation Clause analy-
sis. “Testimonial evidence” may be admitted against a criminal de-
fendant only if the declarant is available for cross-examination at
trial, or, if the declarant is unavailable (and the government has
made reasonable efforts to procure his presence), the defendant has
had a prior opportunity to cross-examine as to the content of the
statement.226 What statements are “testimonial”? In Crawford, the
Court wrote: “Various formulations of this core class of testimonial
statements exist: ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equiva-
lent—that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations,
prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or
similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably ex-
pect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial statements . . . con-
tained in formalized testimonial material, such as affidavits, depo-
sitions, prior testimony, or confessions; statements that were made
under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reason-
ably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a
later trial.” 227 The Court added that it would “leave for another day
any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testimonial,’ ”
but, “[w]hatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to
prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at
a former trial; and to police interrogations.” 228
