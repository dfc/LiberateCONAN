sel’s choices may seem particularly apt in the unstructured, often
style-driven arena of plea bargaining,331an accused, in considering
a plea, is clearly entitled to advice of counsel on the prospect of
conviction at trial and the extent of punishment that might be im-
posed. Thus, in Lafler v. Cooper, the government conceded that the
deficient representation part of the Strickland test was met when
an attorney erroneously advised the defendant during plea negotia-
tions that the facts in his case would not support a conviction for
attempted murder.332
     Moreover, in Padilla v. Kentucky, the Court held that defense
counsel’s Sixth Amendment duty to a client considering a plea goes
beyond advice on issues directly before the criminal court to reach
advice on deportation.333 Because of its severity, historical associa-
tion with the criminal justice system, and increasing certainty fol-
lowing conviction and imprisonment, deportation was found to be
of a “unique nature”: the Court pointedly stated that it was not ad-
dressing whether distinguishing between direct and collateral con-
sequences of conviction was appropriate in bounding defense coun-
sel’s constitutional duty in a criminal case.334 Further, the Court
held that defense counsel failed to meet prevailing professional norms
in representing to Padilla that he did not have to worry about de-
portation because of the length of his legal residency in the U.S.
The Court emphasized that this conclusion was not based on the
attorney’s mistaken advice, but rather on a broader obligation to
inform a noncitizen client whether a plea carries a risk of deporta-
tion.335 Silence is not an option. On the issue of prejudice to Padilla
from ineffective assistance, the Court sent the case back to lower
courts for further findings.336
     What constitutes prejudice from attorney error, the second
Strickland requirement, has proved to be a more difficult issue, and
(attorney’s failure to interview witnesses or search records in preparation for pen-
alty phase of capital murder trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel); See
also, Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. ___, No. 09–8854, slip op. (2010); Cullen v. Pinholster,
563 U.S. ___, No. 09–1088, slip op. (2011) (Sotomayor, J. dissenting).

     332 Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–209, slip op. (2012). Failure to commu-

nicate a plea offer to a defendant also may amount to deficient representation. Mis-
souri v. Frye, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–444, slip op. (2012) (“[A]s a general rule, defense
counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a
plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.”).

     336 In Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–820, slip op. (2013), the

Court held that Padilla announced a “new rule” of criminal procedure that did not
apply “retroactively” during collateral review of convictions then already final. Ret-
roactive application of the Court’s criminal procedure decisions is discussed under
the topic “Retroactivity Versus Prospectivity” in Article III, supra
