that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statu-
tory maximum,” the Court concluded, “must be submitted to a jury,
and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 93 The one exception Ap-
prendi recognized was for sentencing enhancements based on recidi-
vism.94
    Apprendi’s importance soon became evident as the Court ap-
plied its reasoning in other situations. In Ring v. Arizona,95 the Court,
overruling precedent,96 applied Apprendi to invalidate an Arizona
law that authorized imposition of the death penalty only if the judge
made a factual determination as to the existence of any of several
aggravating factors. Although Arizona required that the judge’s find-
ings as to aggravating factors be made beyond a reasonable doubt,
and not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court ruled
that the findings must be made by a jury.97
    In Blakely v. Washington,98 the Court applied Apprendi to cast
doubt on types of widely adopted reform measures that were in-
tended to foster more consistent sentencing practices. Blakely, who
pled guilty to an offense for which the “standard range” under the
Washington State’s sentencing law was 49 to 53 months, was sen-
tenced to 90 months based on the judge’s determination—not de-
rived from facts admitted in the guilty plea—that the offense had
been committed with “deliberate cruelty,” a basis for an “upward
departure” under the statute. The 90-month sentence conformed to

    93  530 U.S. at 490.
    94  530 U.S. at 490. Enhancement of sentences for repeat offenders is tradition-
ally considered a part of sentencing, and a judge may find the existence of previous
valid convictions even if the result is a significant increase in the maximum sen-
tence available. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998) (deported
alien reentering the United States is subject to a maximum sentence of two years,
but upon proof of a felony record, is subject to a maximum of twenty years). Almendarez-
Torres was cited with approval on this point in James v. United States, 550 U.S.
192, 214 n.8 (2007) (“prior convictions need not be treated as an element of the of-
fense for Sixth Amendment purposes”). See also Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20 (1992)
(if the prosecutor has the burden of establishing a prior conviction, a defendant can
be required to bear the burden of challenging its validity).
     95 536 U.S. 584 (2002).
     96 Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990). Ring also appears to overrule some

other decisions on the same issue, including Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 459
(1984), and Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U.S. 638, 640–41 (1989) (per curiam), and under-
cuts the reasoning of another. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738 (1990) (ap-
pellate court may reweigh aggravating and mitigating factors and uphold imposi-
tion of death penalty even though jury relied on an invalid aggravating factor).
     97 “Because Arizona’s enumerated aggravating factors operate as ‘the functional

equivalent of an element of a greater offense,’ . . . the Sixth Amendment requires
that they be found by a jury.” 536 U.S. at 609. The Court rejected Arizona’s request
that it recognize an exception for capital sentencing in order not to interfere with
elaborate sentencing procedures designed to comply with the Eighth Amendment.
Id. at 605–07.
