pering with a jury, or the creation of circumstances raising the dan-
gers thereof, is not to be condoned.136 When the locality of the trial
has been saturated with publicity about a defendant, so that it is
unlikely that he can obtain a disinterested jury, he is constitution-
ally entitled to a change of venue.137 It is undeniably a violation of
due process to subject a defendant to trial in an atmosphere of mob
or threatened mob domination.138
      Because it is too much to expect that jurors can remain uninflu-
enced by evidence they receive even though they are instructed to
use it for only a limited purpose and to disregard it for other pur-
poses, the Court will not permit a confession to be submitted to the
jury without a prior determination by the trial judge that it is ad-
missible. A defendant is denied due process, therefore, if he is con-
victed by a jury that has been instructed to first determine the
voluntariness of a confession and then to disregard the confession
if it is found to be inadmissible.139 Similarly invalid is a jury instruc-
tion in a joint trial to consider a confession only with regard to the
defendant against whom it is admissible, and to disregard that con-
fession as against a co-defendant which it implicates.140
      In Witherspoon v. Illinois,141 the Court held that the exclusion
in capital cases of jurors conscientiously scrupled about capital pun-
ishment, without inquiring whether they could consider the imposi-
tion of the death penalty in the appropriate case, violated a defen-
dant’s constitutional right to an impartial jury. “A man who opposes

prosecution witnesses at defendant’s jury trial denied him his right to an impartial
jury); Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363 (1966) (influence on jury by prejudiced bai-

community in which the crime occurred; whether the publicity was blatantly preju-
dicial; the time elapsed between the publicity and the trial; and whether the jurors’
verdict supported the theory of prejudice. Skilling v. U.S., No. 08–1394, slip op. at
