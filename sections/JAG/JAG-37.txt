return. Offering the preliminary hearing testimony violated the de-
fendant’s right of confrontation. In Douglas v. Alabama,210 the pros-
ecution called as a witness the defendant’s alleged accomplice, and
when the accomplice refused to testify, pleading his privilege against
self-incrimination, the prosecutor read to him to “refresh” his memory
a confession in which he implicated the defendant. Because the de-
fendant could not cross-examine the accomplice with regard to the
truth of the confession, the Court held that the Confrontation Clause
had been violated. In Bruton v. United States,211 the use at a joint
trial of a confession made by one of the defendants was held to vio-
late the confrontation rights of the other defendant who was impli-
cated by it because he could not cross-examine the codefendant.212

     210 380 U.S. 415 (1965). See also Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129 (1968) (Confron-

tation Clause was violated by allowing an informer as to identify himself by alias
and to conceal his true name and address because the defense could not effectively
cross-examine); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308 (1974) (state law prohibiting disclo-
sure of the identity of juvenile offenders could not be applied to preclude cross-
examination of a witness about his juvenile record when the object was to allege
possible bias on the part of the witness). Cf. Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284
(1973); United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 233, 240–41 (1975).
     211 391 U.S. 123 (1968). The Court in this case equated confrontation with the

hearsay rule, first emphasizing “that the hearsay statement inculpating petitioner
was clearly inadmissible against him under traditional rules of evidence”, id. at 128
n.3, and then observing that “[t]he reason for excluding this evidence as an evidentiary
matter also requires its exclusion as a constitutional matter.” Id. at 136 n.12 (empha-
sis by Court). Bruton was applied retroactively in a state case in Roberts v. Russell,
392 U.S. 293 (1968). Where, however, the codefendant takes the stand in his own
defense, denies making the alleged out-of-court statement implicating defendant, and
proceeds to testify favorably to the defendant concerning the underlying facts, the
defendant has not been denied his right of confrontation under Bruton. Nelson v.
O’Neil, 402 U.S. 622 (1971). In two cases, violations of the rule in Bruton have been
held to be “harmless error” in the light of the overwhelming amount of legally ad-
mitted evidence supporting conviction. Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250 (1969);
Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427 (1972). Bruton was held inapplicable, however,
when the nontestifying codefendant’s confession was redacted to omit any reference
to the defendant, and was circumstantially incriminating only as the result of other
evidence properly introduced. Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987). Bruton was
held applicable, however, where a blank space or the word “deleted” is substituted
for the defendant’s name in a co-defendant’s confession, making such confession in-
criminating of the defendant on its face. Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185 (1998).
     212 In Parker v. Randolph, 442 U.S. 62 (1979), the Court was evenly divided on

the question whether interlocking confessions may be admitted without violating the
clause. Four Justices held that admission of such confessions is proper, even though
neither defendant testifies, if the judge gives the jury a limiting instruction. Four
Justices held that a harmless error analysis should be applied, although they then
divided over its meaning in this case. The former approach was rejected in favor of
the latter in Cruz v. New York, 481 U.S. 186 (1987). The appropriate focus is on
reliability, the Court indicated, and “the defendant’s confession may be considered
at trial in assessing whether his codefendant’s statements are supported by suffi-
cient ‘indicia of reliability’ to be directly admissible against him (assuming the ‘un-
availability’ of the codefendant) despite the lack of opportunity for cross-
examination.” 481 U.S. at 193–94.
