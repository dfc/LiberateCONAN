found firmer footing over time, and the Court is reluctant to recog-
nize any per se rules to wall off criminal proceedings, preferring in-
stead that any restrictions be premised on particularized findings
by the trial judge and an exploration of less restrictive options.46

               RIGHT TO TRIAL BY IMPARTIAL JURY

Jury Trial
     By the time the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights
were drafted and ratified, the institution of trial by jury was al-
most universally revered, so revered that its history had been traced
back to Magna Carta.47 The jury began in the form of a grand or
presentment jury with the role of inquest and was started by Frank-
ish conquerors to discover the King’s rights. Henry II regularized
this type of proceeding to establish royal control over the machin-
ery of justice, first in civil trials and then in criminal trials. Trial
by petit jury was not employed at least until the reign of Henry
III, in which the jury was first essentially a body of witnesses, called
for their knowledge of the case; not until the reign of Henry VI did
it become the trier of evidence. It was during the seventeenth cen-
tury that the jury emerged as a safeguard for the criminally ac-
cused.48 Thus, in the eighteenth century, Blackstone could commemo-
rate the institution as part of a “strong and two-fold barrier . . .
between the liberties of the people and the prerogative of the crown”
because “the truth of every accusation . . . . [must] be confirmed
by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbors
indifferently chosen and superior to all suspicion.” 49 The right was
guaranteed in the constitutions of the original 13 states, was guar-
anteed in the body of the Constitution 50 and in the Sixth Amend-
ment, and the constitution of every state entering the Union there-

333 (1966). Compare Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976) (prior re-
straint on pretrial publicity held unconstitutional). Estes found that live television
coverage of criminal trials was an inherent violation of due process, requiring no
specific showing of actual prejudice. This holding was overturned in Chandler v. Florida.

jury.
