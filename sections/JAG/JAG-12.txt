after in one form or another protected the right to jury trial in criminal
cases.51 “Those who emigrated to this country from England brought
with them this great privilege ‘as their birthright and inheritance,
as a part of that admirable common law which had fenced around
and interposed barriers on every side against the approaches of ar-
bitrary power.’ ” 52
     “The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State Constitu-
tions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should
be enforced and justice administered. A right to jury trial is granted
to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Gov-
ernment. Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and
experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded crimi-
nal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too
responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the con-
stitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon
further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with
the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable
safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against
the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. . . . [T]he jury trial provi-
sions . . . reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of offi-
cial power—a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and
liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of
unchecked power . . . found expression in the criminal law in this
insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt
or innocence.” 53
    Because “a general grant of jury trial for serious offenses is a
fundamental right, essential for preventing miscarriages of justice
and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants,”
the Sixth Amendment provision is binding on the states through
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.54 But, as it
cannot be said that every criminal trial or any particular trial that

tion of accurate factfinding has been emphasized. E.g., McKeiver v. Pennsylvania,
403 U.S. 528, 543 (1971). Although federal judges may comment upon the evidence,
the right to a jury trial means that the judge must make clear to the jurors that
such remarks are advisory only and that the jury is the final determiner of all fac-
tual questions. Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466 (1933).
