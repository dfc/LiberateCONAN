to the assistance of counsel.” 356 Thus, counsel need be appointed
only “as far in advance of trial, and as far in advance of any pre-
trial ‘critical stage,’ as necessary to guarantee effective assistance
at trial.” 357
     Dicta in Powell v. Alabama,358 however, indicated that “during
perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings . . . that is to
say, from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their
trial, when consultation, thoroughgoing investigation and prepara-
tion [are] vitally important, the defendants . . . [are] as much en-
titled to such aid [of counsel] during that period as at the trial it-
self.” This language was gradually expanded upon and the Court
developed a concept of “a critical stage in a criminal proceeding” as
indicating when the defendant must be represented by counsel. Thus,
in Hamilton v. Alabama,359 the Court noted that arraignment un-
der state law was a “critical stage” because the defense of insanity
had to be pleaded then or lost, pleas in abatement had to be made
then, and motions to quash on the ground of racial exclusion of grand
jurors or that the grand jury was improperly drawn had to be made
then. In White v. Maryland,360 the Court set aside a conviction ob-
tained at a trial at which the defendant’s plea of guilty, entered at
a preliminary hearing at which he was without counsel, was intro-
duced as evidence against him at trial. Finally, in Coleman v. Ala-
bama,361 the Court denominated a preliminary hearing as a “criti-
cal stage” necessitating counsel even though the only functions of
the hearing were to determine probable cause to warrant present-
ing the case to a grand jury and to fix bail; no defense was re-
quired to be presented at that point and nothing occurring at the
hearing could be used against the defendant at trial. The Court hy-
pothesized that a lawyer might by skilled examination and cross-
     356 128 S. Ct. at 2592 (Alito, J., concurring). Justice Alito’s concurrence, joined

by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Scalia, was not necessary for the majority opin-
ion in Rothgery, but the majority noted that it had not decided “whether the 6-month
delay in appointment of counsel resulted in prejudice to Rothgery’s Sixth Amend-
ment rights, and have no occasion to consider what standards should apply in decid-
ing this.” Id.
     357 128 S. Ct. at 2595 (Alito, J. concurring).
     358 287 U.S. 45, 57 (1932).
     359 368 U.S. 52 (1961).
     360 373 U.S. 59 (1963).
     361 399 U.S. 1 (1970). Justice Harlan concurred solely because he thought the

precedents compelled him to do so, id. at 19, while Chief Justice Burger and Justice
Stewart dissented. Id. at 21, 25. Inasmuch as the role of counsel at the preliminary
hearing stage does not necessarily have the same effect upon the integrity of the
factfinding process as the role of counsel at trial, Coleman was denied retroactive
effect in Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278 (1972). Justice Blackmun joined Chief Jus-
tice Burger in pronouncing Coleman wrongly decided. Id. at 285, 286. Hamilton and
White, however, were held to be retroactive in Arsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U.S.
5 (1968).
