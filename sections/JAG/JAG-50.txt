finally in Hamilton v. Alabama,275 held that in a capital case a de-
fendant need make no showing of particularized need or of preju-
dice resulting from absence of counsel; henceforth, assistance of coun-
sel was a constitutional requisite in capital cases. In non-capital
cases, developments were such that Justice Harlan could assert that
“the ‘special circumstances’ rule has continued to exist in form while
its substance has been substantially and steadily eroded.” 276 The
rule was designed to afford some certainty in the determination of
when failure to appoint counsel would result in a trial lacking in
“fundamental fairness.” Generally, the Court developed three catego-
ries of prejudicial factors, often overlapping in individual cases, which
required the furnishing of assistance of counsel. There were (1) the
personal characteristics of the defendant which made it unlikely he
could obtain an adequate defense of his own,277 (2) the technical
complexity of the charges or of possible defenses to the charges,278
and (3) events occurring at trial that raised problems of preju-
dice.279 The last characteristic especially had been used by the Court
to set aside convictions occurring in the absence of counsel,280 and
the last case rejecting a claim of denial of assistance of counsel had
been decided in 1950.281

     275 368 U.S. 52 (1961). Earlier cases employing the “special circumstances” lan-

guage were Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U.S. 471 (1945); Tompkins v. Missouri, 323 U.S.
485 (1945); Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271 (1945); De Meerleer v. Michigan, 329 U.S.
663 (1947); Marino v. Ragen, 332 U.S. 561 (1947); Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596 (1948).
Dicta appeared in several cases thereafter suggesting an absolute right to counsel
in capital cases. Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 674 (1948); Uveges v. Pennsylvania,
335 U.S. 437, 441 (1948). A state court decision finding a waiver of the right in a
capital case was upheld in Carter v. Illinois, 329 U.S. 173 (1946).
     276 Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 350 (1963).
     277 Youth and immaturity (Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155 (1957); Pennsylva-

nia ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116 (1956); Uveges v. Pennsylvania, 335 U.S.
437 (1948); Wade v. Mayo, 334 U.S. 672 (1948); Marino v. Ragen, 332 U.S. 561 (1947);
De Meerleer v. Michigan, 329 U.S. 663 (1947)), inexperience (Moore v. Michigan, su-
pra (limited education), Uveges v. Pennsylvania, supra), and insanity or mental ab-
normality (Massey v. Moore, 348 U.S. 105 (1954); Palmer v. Ashe, 342 U.S. 134 (1951)),
were commonly cited characteristics of the defendant demonstrating the necessity
for assistance of counsel.
     278 Technicality of the crime charged (Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155 (1957);

Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116 (1956); Williams v. Kaiser,
323 U.S. 471 (1945)), or the technicality of a possible defense (Rice v. Olson, 324
U.S. 786 (1945); McNeal v. Culver, 365 U.S. 109 (1961)), were commonly cited.
     279 The deliberate or careless overreaching by the court or the prosecutor (Gibbs

v. Burke, 337 U.S. 772 (1949); Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736 (1948); Palmer v.
Ashe, 342 U.S. 134 (1951); White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760 (1945)), prejudicial devel-
opments during the trial (Cash v. Culver, 358 U.S. 633 (1959); Gibbs v. Burke, su-
pra), and questionable proceedings at sentencing (Townsend v. Burke, supra), were
commonly cited.
     280 Hudson v. North Carolina, 363 U.S. 697 (1960), held that an unrepresented

defendant had been prejudiced when his co-defendant’s counsel plead his client guilty
in the presence of the jury, the applicable state rules to avoid prejudice in such situ-
ation were unclear, and the defendant in any event had taken no steps to protect
