“effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case.” 307 The Sixth
Amendment also is implicated when a court appoints a defendant’s
attorney to represent his co-defendant as well, where the co-
defendants are known to have potentially conflicting interests.308
     Restrictions on representation imposed during trial also have
been stricken as impermissible interference with defense counsel.
The Court invalidated application of a statute that empowered a
judge to deny final summations before judgment in a nonjury trial:
“The right to the assistance of counsel . . . ensures to the defense
in a criminal trial the opportunity to participate fully and fairly
. . . .” 309 And, in Geders v. United States,310 the Court held that a
trial judge’s order preventing a defendant from consulting his coun-
sel during a 17-hour overnight recess between his direct and cross-
examination, to prevent tailoring of testimony or “coaching,” de-
prived the defendant of his right to assistance of counsel and was
invalid.311 Other direct and indirect restraints upon counsel have
been found to violate the Amendment.312 Government investigators
also are barred from impermissibly interfering with the relation-
ship between defendant and counsel.313
     Additionally, the Sixth Amendment’s right to effective assis-
tance attaches directly to the fidelity and competence of defense coun-
sel’s services, regardless of whether counsel is appointed or pri-
vately retained or whether the government in any way brought about
the defective representation. “The vital guarantee of the Sixth Amend-

U.S. 60, 70 (1942).

     309 Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 858 (1975). “[T]he right to assistance to

counsel has been understood to mean that there can be no restrictions upon the
function of counsel in defending a criminal prosecution in accord with the traditions
of the adversary factfinding process that has been constitutionalized in the Sixth
and Fourteenth Amendments.” 422 U.S. at 857.

     311 Geders was distinguished in Perry v. Leeke, 488 U.S. 272 (1989), in which

the Court upheld a trial court’s order that the defendant and his counsel not con-
sult during a 15-minute recess between the defendant’s direct testimony and his cross-
examination.
     312 E.g., Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570 (1961) (where Georgia statute, uniquely,

barred sworn testimony by defendants, a defendant was entitled to the assistance of
counsel in presenting the unsworn statement allowed him under Georgia law); Brooks
v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605 (1972) (alternative holding) (statute requiring defendant
to testify prior to any other witness for defense or to forfeit the right to testify de-
nied him due process by depriving him of the tactical advice of counsel on whether
to testify and when).
     313 United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361 (1981) (Court assumed that investi-

gators who met with defendant on another matter without knowledge or permission
of counsel and who disparaged counsel and suggested she could do better without
him, interfered with counsel, but Court held that in absence of showing of adverse
consequences to representation, dismissal of indictment was inappropriate remedy).
