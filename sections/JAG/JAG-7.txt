tice permitting a prosecutor to take nolle prosequi with leave, which
discharged an indicted defendant from custody but left him subject
at any time thereafter to prosecution at the discretion of the pros-
ecutor, was condemned as violating the guarantee of a speedy trial.23
    When the Right is Denied.—“The right of a speedy trial is
necessarily relative. It is consistent with delays and depends upon
circumstances. It secures rights to a defendant. It does not pre-
clude the rights of public justice.” 24 No period of time is per se too
long under this guarantee,25 nor must any particular prejudice to a
fair trial be shown.26 The Court, rather, has adopted an ad hoc bal-
ancing approach. “We can do little more than identify some of the
factors which courts should assess in determining whether a par-
ticular defendant has been deprived of his right. Though some might
express them in different ways, we identify four such factors: Length
of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his
right, and prejudice to the defendant.” 27
    The fact of delay triggers an inquiry into the circumstances of
the case. Reasons for delay will vary: indeed, reasons for delay, and
allocation of responsibility for it, may be disputed.28 A deliberate
delay for advantage will weigh heavily, whereas the absence of a

been tolled by the indictment). In Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354 (1957), the
majority assumed and the dissent asserted that sentence is part of the trial and
that too lengthy or unjustified a delay in imposing sentence could run afoul of this
guarantee.
     24 Beavers v. Haubert, 198 U.S. 77, 87 (1905) (holding that the guarantee could

not be invoked by a defendant first indicted in one district to prevent removal to
another district where he had also been indicted). A determination that a defendant
has been denied his right to a speedy trial results in a decision to dismiss the indict-
ment or to reverse a conviction in order that the indictment be dismissed. Strunk v.
United States, 412 U.S. 434 (1973). A trial court denial of a motion to dismiss on
speedy trial grounds is not an appealable order under the “collateral order” excep-
tion to the finality rule. One must raise the issue on appeal from a conviction. United
States v. MacDonald, 435 U.S. 850 (1977).
     25 Cf. Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354 (1957); United States v. Ewell, 383

U.S. 116 (1966). See United States v. Provoo, 350 U.S. 857 (1955), aff’g 17 F.R.D.

514, 536 (1972) (Justice White concurring).
     27 Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972). For the federal courts, Congress

under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974 imposed strict time deadlines, replacing the Barker
factors.
     28 E.g. Boyer v. Louisiana, 569 U.S. ___, No. 11–9953, slip op. (2013) (writ of

certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted). Three Justices of the five-Justice Boyer
majority wrote in concurrence that the record disclosed Boyer’s requests for continu-
ances as the single largest contributor to delay in bringing Boyer to trial. Examin-
ing the same record, four dissenting Justices concluded that most of the delay was
caused by Lousiana’s failure to provide funding for Boyer’s defense, which failure,
according to the dissent, should weigh against the state under Speedy Trial analy-
sis.
