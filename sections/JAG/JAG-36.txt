had been procured by the defendant, testimony given at a previous
trial on a different indictment could be used at the subsequent trial.203
The Court had also recognized the admissibility of dying declara-
tions 204 and of testimony given at a former trial by a witness since
deceased.205 The prosecution was not permitted to use a judgment
of conviction against other defendants on charges of theft in order
to prove that the property found in the possession of the defendant
now on trial was stolen.206 A prosecutor, however, may comment on
a defendant’s presence at trial, and call attention to the defen-
dant’s opportunity to tailor his or her testimony to comport with
that of previous witnesses.207
    For years the Court has struggled with the relationship be-
tween hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause. In a series of
decisions beginning in 1965, the Court seemed to equate the Con-
frontation Clause with the hearsay rule, positing that a major pur-
pose of the clause was “to give the defendant charged with crime
an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him,” unless
one of the hearsay exceptions applies.208 Thus, in Pointer v. Texas,209
the complaining witness had testified at a preliminary hearing at
which he was not cross-examined and the defendant was not repre-
sented by counsel, and by the time of trial, the witness had moved
to another state and the prosecutor made no effort to obtain his

documentary evidence to establish collateral facts, admissible under the common law,
to permit certification as an additional record to the appellate court of the events of
the trial.

the opportunity to cross-examine and the occasion for the jury to weigh the de-
meanor of the witness.” Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 725 (1968). Unjustified limita-
tion of the defendant’s right to cross-examine witnesses presented against him at
trial may constitute a confrontation clause violation, Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129
(1968), or a denial of due process, Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687 (1931); and

grounds, rejecting the “incorporation” holding. Id. at 408, 409. See also Barber v.
Page, 390 U.S. 719 (1968), in which the Court refused to permit the state to use the
preliminary hearing testimony of a witness in a federal prison in another state at
the time of trial. The Court acknowledged the hearsay exception permitting the use
of such evidence when a witness was unavailable but refused to find him “unavail-
able” when the state had made no effort to procure him; and Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408
U.S. 204 (1972), in which the Court permitted the state to assume the unavailabil-
ity of a witness then living in Sweden, and to use the transcript of the witness’
testimony at a former trial.
