in the jury-selection process.” 130 Further, once a plaintiff demon-
strates a prima facie violation, the defendant faces a formidable bur-
den: the jury selection process may be sustained under the Sixth
Amendment only if those aspects of the process that result in the
disproportionate exclusion of a distinctive group, such as exemp-
tion criteria, “manifestly and primarily” advance a “significant state
interest.” 131 Thus, in one case the Court voided a selection system
under which no woman would be called for jury duty unless she
had previously filed a written declaration of her desire to be sub-
ject to service, and, in another it invalidated a state selection sys-
tem granting women who so requested an automatic exemption from
jury service.132
     Second, there must be assurance that the jurors chosen are un-
biased, i.e., willing to decide the case on the basis of the evidence
presented. The Court has held that in the absence of an actual show-
ing of bias, a defendant in the District of Columbia is not denied
an impartial jury when he is tried before a jury composed primar-
ily of government employees.133 A violation of a defendant’s right to
an impartial jury does occur, however, when the jury or any of its
members is subjected to pressure or influence which could impair
freedom of action; the trial judge should conduct a hearing in which
the defense participates to determine whether impartiality has been
undermined.134 Exposure of the jury to possibly prejudicial mate-
rial and disorderly courtroom activities may deny impartiality and
must be inquired into.135 Private communications, contact, or tam-
     130 Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1979). To show that underrepresenta-

tion resulted from systematic exclusion requires rigorous evidence beyond merely
pointing to a single factor or a host of factors that might have caused fewer mem-
bers of a distinct group to have been included. Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. ___, No.
08–1402, slip op. (2010).

     133 Frazier v. United States, 335 U.S. 497 (1948); Dennis v. United States, 339

U.S. 162 (1950). On common-law grounds, the Court in Crawford v. United States,
212 U.S. 183 (1909), disqualified such employees, but a statute removing the disquali-
fication because of the increasing difficulty in finding jurors in the District of Colum-
bia was sustained in United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123 (1936).
     134 Remmer v. United States, 350 U.S. 377 (1956) (attempted bribe of a juror

reported by him to authorities); Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982) (during trial
one of the jurors had been actively seeking employment in the District Attorney’s
office).
     135 E.g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 (1961); Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333

(1966). Exposure of the jurors to knowledge about the defendant’s prior criminal re-
cord and activities is not alone sufficient to establish a presumption of reversible
prejudice, but on voir dire jurors should be questioned about their ability to judge
impartially. Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794 (1975). The Court indicated that under
the same circumstances in a federal trial it would have overturned the conviction
pursuant to its supervisory power. Id. at 797–98, citing Marshall v. United States,
