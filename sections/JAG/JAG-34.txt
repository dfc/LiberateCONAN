tion of the charge.186 The assignment of a district judge from one
district to another, conformably to statute, does not create a new
judicial district whose boundaries are undefined nor subject the ac-
cused to trial in a district not established when the offense with
which he is charged was committed.187 For offenses against federal
laws not committed within any state, Congress has the sole power
to prescribe the place of trial; such an offense is not local and may
be tried at such place as Congress may designate.188 The place of
trial may be designated by statute after the offense has been com-
mitted.189

                        NOTICE OF ACCUSATION
    The constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause
of the accusation entitles the defendant to insist that the indict-
ment apprise him of the crime charged with such reasonable cer-
tainty that he can make his defense and protect himself after judg-
ment against another prosecution on the same charge.190 No indictment
is sufficient if it does not allege all of the ingredients that consti-
tute the crime. Where the language of a statute is, according to the
natural import of the words, fully descriptive of the offense, it is
sufficient if the indictment follows the statutory phraseology,191 but
where the elements of the crime have to be ascertained by refer-
ence to the common law or to other statutes, it is not sufficient to
set forth the offense in the words of the statute. The facts neces-
sary to bring the case within the statutory definition must also be
alleged.192 If an offense cannot be accurately and clearly described
without an allegation that the accused is not within an exception
contained in the statutes, an indictment that does not contain such
allegation is defective.193 Despite the omission of obscene particu-
lars, an indictment in general language is good if the unlawful con-
duct is described so as reasonably to inform the accused of the na-
ture of the charge sought to be established against him.194 The
