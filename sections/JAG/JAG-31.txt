cial prejudice infecting a trial, as when the facts are merely that
the defendant is black and the victim white, the Constitution is sat-
isfied by a more generalized but thorough inquiry into the impar-
tiality of the veniremen.161
     Although government is not constitutionally obligated to allow
peremptory challenges,162 typically a system of peremptory chal-
lenges has existed in criminal trials, in which both prosecution and
defense may, without stating any reason, excuse a certain number
of prospective jurors.163 Although, in Swain v. Alabama,164 the Court
held that a prosecutor’s purposeful exclusion of members of a spe-
cific racial group from the jury would violate the Equal Protection
Clause, it posited so difficult a standard of proof that defendants
could seldom succeed. The Swain standard of proof was relaxed in
Batson v. Kentucky,165 with the result that a defendant may estab-
lish an equal protection violation resulting from a prosecutor’s use
of peremptory challenges to systematically exclude blacks from the
jury.166 A violation can occur whether or not the defendant and the
excluded jurors are of the same race.167 Racially discriminatory use
of peremptory challenges does not, however, constitute a violation
of the Sixth Amendment, the Court ruled in Holland v. Illinois.168
The Sixth Amendment “no more forbids the prosecutor to strike ju-
rors on the basis of race than it forbids him to strike them on the
     161 Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589 (1976). The Court noted that under its super-

visory power it would require a federal court faced with the same circumstances to
propound appropriate questions to identify racial prejudice if requested by the defen-
dant. Id. at 597 n.9. See Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308 (1931). But see
Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182 (1981), in which the trial judge re-
fused a defense request to inquire about possible bias against Mexicans. A plurality
apparently adopted a rule that, all else being equal, the judge should necessarily
inquire about racial or ethnic prejudice only in cases of violent crimes in which the
defendant and victim are members of different racial or ethnic groups, id. at 192, a
rule rejected by two concurring Justices. Id. at 194. Three dissenting Justices thought
the judge must always ask when defendant so requested. Id. at 195.
     162 “This Court has long recognized that peremptory challenges are not of fed-

eral constitutional dimension.” Rivera v. Illinois, 129 S. Ct. 1446, 1450 (2009) (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted) (state trial court’s erroneous denial of a defendant’s
peremptory challenge does not warrant reversal of conviction if all seated jurors were
qualified and unbiased).
     163 Cf. Stilson v. United States, 250 U.S. 583, 586 (1919), holding that it is no

violation of the guarantee to limit the number of peremptory challenges to each de-
fendant in a multi-party trial.

     165 476 U.S. 79 (1986).
     166 See Fourteenth Amendment discussion of “Equal Protection and Race,” infra.
     167 Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991) (defendant has standing to raise equal

protection rights of excluded juror of different race).
     168 493 U.S. 474 (1990). But see Trevino v. Texas, 503 U.S. 562 (1992) (claim of

Sixth Amendment violation resulting from racially discriminatory use of peremp-
tory challenges treated as sufficient to raise equal protection claim under Swain and
Batson).
