seemed more likely than not that the framers of the Sixth Amend-
ment had not intended to preserve the requirement within the term
“jury.” Therefore, the Justices undertook a functional analysis of the
jury and could not discern that the requirement of unanimity ma-
terially affected the role of the jury as a barrier against oppression
and as a guarantee of a commonsense judgment of laymen. The Jus-
tices also determined that the unanimity requirement is not impli-
cated in the constitutional requirement of proof beyond a reason-
able doubt, and is not necessary to preserve the feature of the requisite
cross-section representation on the jury.67 Four dissenting Justices
thought that omitting the unanimity requirement would under-
mine the reasonable doubt standard, would permit a majority of ju-
rors simply to ignore those interpreting the facts differently, and
would permit oppression of dissenting minorities.68 Justice Powell,
on the other hand, thought that unanimity was mandated in fed-
eral trials by history and precedent and that it should not be de-
parted from; however, because it was the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment that imposed the basic jury-trial require-
ment on the states, he did not believe that it was necessary to im-
pose all the attributes of a federal jury on the states. He therefore
concurred in permitting less-than-unanimous verdicts in state courts.69
     Certain functions of the jury are likely to remain consistent be-
tween the federal and state court systems. For instance, the require-
ment that a jury find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,
which had already been established under the Due Process Clause,70
has been held to be a standard mandated by the Sixth Amend-
ment.71 The Court further held that the Fifth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment require that a jury find
a defendant guilty of every element of the crime with which he is
charged, including questions of mixed law and fact.72 Thus, a dis-
trict court presiding over a case of providing false statements to a
     67 Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972) (Justices White, Blackmun, and

Rehnquist, and Chief Justice Burger). Justice Blackmun indicated a doubt that any
closer division than nine-to-three in jury decisions would be permissible. Id. at 365.

(1972) (Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, and Marshall).
     69 406 U.S. at 366. Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U.S. 130 (1979), however, held that

conviction by a non-unanimous six-person jury in a state criminal trial for a nonpetty
offense, under a provision permitting conviction by five out of six jurors, violated
the right of the accused to trial by jury. Acknowledging that the issue was “close”
and that no bright line illuminated the boundary between permissible and impermis-
sible, the Court thought the near-uniform practice throughout the Nation of requir-
ing unanimity in six-member juries required nullification of the state policy. See also
