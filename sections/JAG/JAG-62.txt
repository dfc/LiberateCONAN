cross-examination, or failure of counsel to subject the prosecution’s
case to meaningful adversarial testing.345 “Apart from circum-
stances of that magnitude, however, there is generally no basis for
finding a Sixth Amendment violation unless the accused can show
[prejudice],” 346 and consequently most claims of inadequate repre-
sentation continue to be measured by the Strickland standard.347
    Self-Representation.—The Court has held that the Sixth Amend-
ment, in addition to guaranteeing the right to retained or ap-
pointed counsel, also guarantees a defendant the right to represent
himself.348 It is a right the defendant must adopt knowingly and
intelligently; under some circumstances the trial judge may deny

     345 466 U.S. at 657, 659. But see Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685 (2002) (failure to

introduce mitigating evidence and waiver of closing argument in penalty phase of
death penalty case was not failure to test prosecution’s case, where mitigating evi-
dence had been presented during guilt phase and where waiver of argument de-
prived skilled prosecutor of an opportunity for rebuttal); Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S.
162 (2002) (failure of judge who knew or should have known of an attorney’s conflict-
ing interest to inquire as to whether such conflict was prejudicial not grounds for
automatic reversal). In Wright v. Van Patten, 128 S. Ct. 743 (2008) (per curiam),
the Supreme Court noted that it has never ruled on whether, during a plea hearing
at which the defendant pleads guilty, defense counsel’s being linked to the court-
room by speaker phone, rather than being physically present, is likely to result in
such poor performance that Cronic should apply. The fact that the Court has never
ruled on the question means that “it cannot be said that the state court ‘unreason-
abl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law,’ ” and, as a consequence, under the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the
defendant is not entitled to habeas relief. Id. at 748 (quoting Carey v. Musladin, 549
U.S. 70, 77 (2006), as to which see “Limitations on Habeas Corpus Review of Capi-
tal Sentences” under Eighth Amendment, infra.
     346 Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 n.26.
     347 Strickland and Cronic were decided the same day, and the Court’s opinion

in each cited the other. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666
n.41. The Cronic presumption of prejudice may be appropriate when counsel’s “over-
all performance” is brought into question, whereas Strickland is generally the appro-
priate test for “claims based on specified [counsel] errors.” Cronic, 466 U.S. at 666
n.41. The narrow reach of Cronic has been illustrated by subsequent decisions. Not
constituting per se ineffective assistance is a defense counsel’s failure to file a notice
of appeal, or in some circumstances even to consult with the defendant about an
appeal. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000). But see Lozada v. Deeds, 498 U.S.
430, 432 (1991) (per curiam). See also Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004) (no pre-
sumption of prejudice when a defendant has failed to consent to a tenable strategy
counsel has adequately disclosed to and discussed with him). A standard somewhat
different from Cronic and Strickland governs claims of attorney conflict of interest.
See discussion of Cuyler v. Sullivan under “Protection of Right to Retained Coun-
sel,” supra.
     348 Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975). An invitation to overrule Faretta

because it leads to unfair trials for defendants was declined in Indiana v. Edwards,
128 S. Ct. 2379, 2388 (2008). Even if the defendant exercises his right to his detri-
ment, the Constitution ordinarily guarantees him the opportunity to do so. A defen-
dant who represents himself cannot thereafter complain that the quality of his de-
fense denied him effective assistance of counsel. 422 U.S. at 834–35 n.46. The Court,
however, has not addressed what state aid, such as access to a law library, might
need to be made available to a defendant representing himself. Kane v. Garcia Espitia,
