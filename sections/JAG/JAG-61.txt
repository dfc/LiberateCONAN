appeared to refine the Strickland test when it stated that an “analy-
sis focusing solely on mere outcome determination” is “defective” un-
less attention is also given to whether the result was “fundamen-
tally unfair or unreliable.” 340 However, the Court subsequently
characterized Lockhart as addressing a class of exceptions to the
“outcome determinative” test, and not supplanting it. According to
Williams v. Taylor, it would disserve justice in some circumstances
to find prejudice premised on a likelihood of a different outcome.341
An overriding interest in fundamental fairness precluded a preju-
dice finding in Lockhart, for example, because such a finding would
be nothing more than a fortuitous windfall for the defendant. As
another example, it would be unjust to find legitimate prejudice in
a defense attorney’s interference with a defendant’s perjured testi-
mony, even if that testimony could have altered a trial’s out-
come.342 In Lafler v. Cooper, four dissenters further would have im-
posed a fundamental fairness overlay to foreclose relief whenever a
defendant proceeded to trial after turning down a plea offer be-
cause of incompetent advice of counsel.343 In their view, conviction
after a full and fair trial cannot be prejudicial in a constitutional
sense, even if a forgone plea would have yielded lesser charges or
punishment. This view did not prevail, however.
    A second category of recognized exceptions to the application of
the “outcome determinative” prejudice test includes the relatively
limited number of cases in which prejudice is presumed. This pre-
sumption occurs when there are “circumstances that are so likely
to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a
particular case is unjustified.” 344 These situations, the Court ex-
plained in United States v. Cronic, involve some kind of “break-
down of the adversarial process,” and include actual or construc-
tive denial of counsel, denial of such basics as the right to effective

     340 506 U.S. 364, 368–70 (1993). Defense counsel had failed to raise a constitu-

tional claim during sentencing that would have saved the defendant from a death
sentence. The case precedent that supported the claim was itself overturned after
sentencing but before defendant asserted in a habeas writ that he had received in-
effective assistance. The Court held, 7–2, that even though the adequacy of coun-
sel’s representation is assessed under the standards that existed contemporaneously
with the conduct, it was inappropriate in assessing prejudice to give the defendant
the benefit of overturned case law. So long as the defendant was not deprived of a
procedural or substantive right to which he would still be entitled, relief is not avail-
able. 506 U.S. at 372–73.
