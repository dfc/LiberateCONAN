one that gained additional doctrinal salience after Lafler and Frye.337
The touchstone of “prejudice” under Strickland is that the defen-
dant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but
for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability suffi-
cient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” 338 Nevertheless, de-
fendants frequently fall short on the prejudice requirement, with
the Court posing it as a threshold matter and failing to find how
other representation could have made a significant difference.339
    Beyond Strickland’s “reasonable probability of a different re-
sult” starting point, there are issues of when an “outcome determi-
native” test alone suffices, what exceptions exist, and whether the
general rule should be modified. In Lockhart v. Fretwell, the Court
     337 The Frye Court observed that, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,

ninety-seven percent of recent federal convictions and ninety-four percent of recent
state convictions had resulted from guilty pleas. Hill v. Lockhart had earlier estab-
lished a basis for a Sixth Amendment challenge to a conviction arising from a plea
bargain if a defendant could show he accepted the plea after having received ineffec-
tive assistance of counsel. By laying a basis for a Sixth Amendment challenge to a
failure to accept a plea offer from the prosecution, Frye and Lafler recognized the
possiblility of prejudice from ineffective bargaining alone regardless of the fairness
of a subsequent conviction after a later plea to the court or a full trial.
     338 Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. This standard does not require that “a defen-

dant show that counsel’s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome
in the case.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693. See also Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. ___,
No. 08–10537, slip op. at 15 (2009). Also, presentation of a plausible mitigation theory
supported by evidence does not foreclose prejudice based on counsel’s earlier failure
to have conducted an adequate mitigation investigation. Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S.
___, No. 09–8854, slip op. (2010) (counsel presented evidence of supportive family
ties as a mitigating factor in the penalty phase of a capital case, but a fuller inves-
tigation by counsel would have uncovered evidence of physical abuse, pronounced
brain damage, and significantly diminished mental functioning). See also, e.g., Glover
v. United States, 531 U.S. 198 (2001) (6- to 21-month increase in prison term is
sufficient “prejudice” under Strickland to raise issue of ineffective counsel).
     339 E.g., Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.S. ___, No. 08–724, slip op. at 11–15 (2010). See

also Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 60 (1985). In Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985),
the Court applied the Strickland test to attorney decisions in plea bargaining, hold-
ing that a defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s er-
rors, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty. And, prejudice may be particu-
larly difficult to infer from a decision to plead guilty because of the many uncertainties
still outstanding during plea negotiations. Premo v. Moore, 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–
658, slip op. (2011).
     But see Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–444, slip op. (2012) and Lafler v.
Cooper, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–209, slip op. (2012), in which the Court acknowledged
that prejudice could arise from not accepting a plea offer from the prosecution be-
cause of inadequate counsel. When prejudice does arise from not accepting a plea
offer, fashioning a remedy should neither grant the defendant a windfall (e.g., auto-
matic revival of the plea offer regardless of the defendant’s subsequent conduct or
conviction), nor must the government’s efforts in securing a later conviction be ig-
nored. To determine a remedy, the Lafler majority would leave it to the trial court’s
discretion in each case to sentence under the forgone plea, sentence under the sub-
sequent conviction, or sentence in accordance with alternatives somewhere in be-
tween. The dissenting Justices pointedly criticized this “opaque” guidance.
