is held without a jury is unfair,55 a defendant may waive the right
and go to trial before a judge alone.56
    The Attributes and Function of the Jury.—It was previ-
ously the Court’s position that the right to a jury trial meant “a
trial by jury as understood and applied at common law, and in-
cludes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this
country and England when the Constitution was adopted.” 57 It had
therefore been held that this included trial by a jury of 12 per-
sons 58 who must reach a unanimous verdict 59 and that the jury
trial must be held during the first court proceeding and not de novo
at the first appellate stage.60 However, as it extended the guaran-
tee to the states, the Court indicated that at least some of these
standards were open to re-examination,61 and in subsequent cases
it has done so. In Williams v. Florida,62 the Court held that the

     55 391 U.S. at 159. Thus, state trials conducted before Duncan was decided were

held to be valid still. DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631 (1968).
     56 Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276 (1930). As with other waivers, this one

must be by the express and intelligent consent of the defendant. A waiver of jury
trial must also be with the consent of the prosecution and the sanction of the court.
A refusal by either the prosecution or the court to defendant’s request for consent to
waive denies him no right since he then gets what the Constitution guarantees, a
jury trial. Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24 (1965). It may be a violation of defen-
dant’s rights to structure the trial process so as effectively to encourage him “need-
lessly” to waive or to penalize the decision to go to the jury, but the standards here
are unclear. Compare United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968), with Brady v.
United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970), and McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759 (1970),
and see also State v. Funicello, 60 N.J. 60, 286 A.2d 55 (1971), cert. denied, 408 U.S.
942 (1972).
     57 Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288 (1930).
     58 Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343 (1898). Dicta in other cases was to the same

effect. Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581, 586 (1900); Rassmussen v. United States, 197
U.S. 516, 519 (1905); Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288 (1930).
     59 Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740 (1948). See dicta in Maxwell v. Dow,

176 U.S. 581, 586 (1900); Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288 (1930).
     60 Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540 (1888). Preserving Callan, as being based on

Article II, § 2, as well as on the Sixth Amendment and being based on a more bur-
densome procedure, the Court in Ludwig v. Massachusetts, 427 U.S. 618 (1976), ap-
proved a state two-tier system under which persons accused of certain crimes must
be tried in the first instance in the lower tier without a jury and if convicted may
appeal to the second tier for a trial de novo by jury. Applying a due process stan-
dard, the Court, in an opinion by Justice Blackmun, found that neither the imposi-
tion of additional financial costs upon a defendant, nor the imposition of increased
psychological and physical hardships of two trials, nor the potential of a harsher
sentence on the second trial impermissibly burdened the right to a jury trial. Jus-
tices Stevens, Brennan, Stewart, and Marshall dissented. Id. at 632. See also North
v. Russell, 427 U.S. 328 (1976).
     61 Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 158 n.30 (1968); DeStefano v. Woods, 392

U.S. 631, 632–33 (1968).
     62 399 U.S. 78 (1970). Justice Marshall would have required juries of 12 in both

federal and state courts, id. at 116, while Justice Harlan contended that the Sixth
Amendment required juries of 12, although his view of the due process standard
was that the requirement was not imposed on the states. Id. at 117.
