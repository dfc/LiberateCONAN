tection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment,125 and perhaps by
the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In addition, the
Court’s has directed its supervisory power over the federal system
to the issue.126 Even before the Court extended the right to a jury
trial to state courts, it was firmly established that, if a state chose
to provide juries, the juries had to be impartial.127
     Impartiality is a two-fold requirement. First, “the selection of a
petit jury from a representative cross section of the community is
an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury
trial.” 128 This requirement applies only to jury panels or venires
from which petit juries are chosen, and not to the composition of
the petit juries themselves.129 “In order to establish a prima facie
violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, the defendant must
show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ‘distinctive’ group
in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in veni-
res from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in re-
lation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that
this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group

     125 Thus, it violates the Equal Protection Clause to exclude African-Americans

from grand and petit juries, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880); Alexan-
der v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625 (1972), whether defendant is or is not an African-
American, Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493 (1972), and exclusion of potential jurors be-
cause of their national ancestry is unconstitutional, at least where defendant is of
that ancestry as well, Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954); Castaneda v. Partida,
430 U.S. 482 (1977).
     126 In the exercise of its supervisory power over the federal courts, the Court

has permitted any defendant to challenge the arbitrary exclusion from jury service
of his own or any other class. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 83–87 (1942);
Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 220 (1946); Ballard v. United States,
329 U.S. 187 (1946). In Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), and Duren v. Mis-
souri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979), male defendants were permitted to challenge the exclu-
sion of women as a Sixth Amendment violation.
     127 Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466 (1965).
     128 Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 528 (1975). See also Williams v. Florida,

399 U.S. 78, 100 (1970); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 474 (1953). In Fay v. New
York, 332 U.S. 261 (1947), and Moore v. New York, 333 U.S. 565 (1948), the Court
in 5-to-4 decisions upheld state use of “blue ribbon” juries from which particular
groups, such as laborers and women, had been excluded. With the extension of the
jury trial provision and its fair cross section requirement to the States, the opinions
in these cases must be considered tenuous, but the Court has reiterated that defen-
dants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition. Taylor, 419 U.S. at
538. Congress has implemented the constitutional requirement by statute in federal
courts by the Federal Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90–274, 82
Stat. 53, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1861 et seq.
     129 Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162 (1986). “We have never invoked the fair

cross-section principle to invalidate the use of either for-cause or peremptory chal-
lenges to prospective jurors, or to require petit juries, as opposed to jury panels or
venires, to reflect the composition of the community at large.” 476 U.S. at 173. The
explanation is that the fair cross-section requirement “is a means of assuring, not a
representative jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an impartial one
(which it does).” Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474, 480 (1990) (emphasis original).
