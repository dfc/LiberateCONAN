after such an emergency has ended, however, would be treated as
testimonial and could not be introduced into evidence.238
     In Michigan v. Bryant,239 however, the Court appeared to ex-
tend the scope and basis of the “ongoing emergency” exception. In
Bryant, a man dying from a gun shot wound was found by police
lying on the ground next to his car in a gas station parking lot,
several blocks away from where he had been shot. In response to
questions from several police officers, the victim identified the de-
fendant as his assailant, and his response was later used in the
defendant’s trial despite the victim’s unavailability to testify. In de-
termining whether such statements were related to an ongoing emer-
gency (and thus were non-testimonial), the majority noted that an
objective analysis of this question was “highly context-dependent”,240
and depended on the nature of the crime, the weapon utilized, the
medical condition of the victim, and the formality of the setting.
Further, in determining the testimonial nature of such informa-
tion, the Court considered not just the intent of the declarant, but
also the intentions of the police coming upon the crime scene who,
ignorant of preceding events, began seeking information to decide
whether there was a continuing danger to the victim or the pub-
lic.241 Considering that there are other potential exceptions to the
Confrontation Clause where the “primary purpose” for creation of
evidence is not related to gathering evidence for trial,242 the breadth
of this opinion may signal a retreat from the limits of Crawford.
    In two pre-Crawford cases, the Court took contrasting ap-
proaches to the Confrontation Clause regarding state efforts to pro-
tect a child from psychological trauma while testifying. In Coy v.

     238 547 U.S. at 828–29. Thus, where police responding to a domestic violence

report interrogated a woman in the living room while her husband was being ques-
tioned in the kitchen, there was no present threat to the woman, so such informa-
tion as was solicited was testimonial. Id. at 830 (facts of Hammon v. Indiana, con-
sidered together with Davis.)
     239 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–150, slip op. (2011). Justice Sotomayor wrote the major-

ity opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kennedy, Breyer and Alito.
Justice Thomas file an opinion concurring in judgment, while Justices Scalia and
Ginsburg filed dissenting opinions. Justice Kagan did not participate in the case.

     241 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–150, slip op. at 20.
     242 See 562 U.S. ___, No. 09–150, slip op. at 15 n.9. The Court noted that many

exceptions to hearsay rules rest on the belief that certain statements are made for a
purpose other than use in a prosecution See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) (state-
ment by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy); 803(4) (State-
ments for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment); 803(6) (Records of Regu-
larly Conducted Activity); 803(8) (Public Records and Reports); 803(9) (Records of
Vital Statistics); 803(11) (Records of Religious Organizations); 803(12) (Marriage, Bap-
tismal, and Similar Certificates); 803(13) (Family Records); and 804(b)(3) (State-
ment Against Interest).
