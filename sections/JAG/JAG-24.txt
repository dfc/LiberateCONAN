     Subsequently, in Spears v. United States,120 the Court, empha-
sizing that the Guidelines “are advisory only,” clarified “that dis-
trict courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the
. . . Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those Guide-
lines.” 121 In Spears, a district court had given a defendant a sen-
tence significantly below the Guidelines for distribution of crack co-
caine, noting that the Guidelines required 100 times more powder
cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger a particular sentencing range.
The Supreme Court held that, if a sentencing court believes “that
the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentencing guidelines for the treat-
ment of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine creates ‘an unwar-
ranted disparity within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(a),’ ” then
it may vary downward from the Guidelines even when the particu-
lar defendant “presents no special mitigating circumstances” to jus-
tify a lower sentence.122
     The Booker line of cases addresses the role of the Sentencing
Guidelines in imposing and reviewing individual sentences. Booker,
however, did not overturn the Sentencing Reform Act in its en-
tirety, nor did it abolish the Guidelines themselves. One set of pro-
visions left intact directed the Sentencing Commission to review the
Guidelines periodically, authorized it to reduce the Guidelines range
for individual offenses and make the reduced ranges retroactive, but
also generally foreclosed a court from then reducing a sentence pre-
viously imposed to one less than the minimum contained in the
amended Guideline range. In Dillon v. United States,123 the Court
distinguished this sentence modification process from a sentencing
or resentencing, and upheld mandatory limits on judicial reduc-
tions of sentences under it.

Impartial Jury
    The requirement of an impartial jury is secured not only by the
Sixth Amendment, which is as applicable to the states as to the
Federal Government,124 but also by the Due Process and Equal Pro-

the allocation of the authority to decide issues of substantive sentencing policy, an
issue on which the Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing. The yawning gap be-
tween the Sixth Amendment and the Court’s opinion should be enough to show that
the Blakely-Booker line of cases has gone astray.” Id. at 605 (Alito, J., dissenting).
