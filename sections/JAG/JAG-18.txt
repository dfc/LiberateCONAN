poses of determining whether a defendant is insane or mentally re-
tarded and consequently not eligible for the death penalty.87
    Within the context of a criminal trial, what factual issues are
submitted to the jury was traditionally determined by whether the
fact to be established is an element of a crime or instead is a sen-
tencing factor.88 Under this approach, the right to a jury had ex-
tended to the finding of all facts establishing the elements of a crime,
but sentencing factors could be evaluated by a judge.89 Evaluating
the issue primarily under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Pro-
cess Clause, the Court initially deferred to Congress and the states
on this issue, allowing them broad leeway in determining which facts
are elements of a crime and which are sentencing factors.90
    Breaking with this tradition, however, the Court in Apprendi v.
New Jersey held that a sentencing factor cannot be used to in-
crease the maximum penalty imposed for the underlying crime.91
“The relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect.” 92 Apprendi
had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for no
more than ten years, but had been sentenced to 12 years based on
a judge’s findings, by a preponderance of the evidence, that enhance-
ment grounds existed under the state’s hate crimes law. “[A]ny fact

304, 317 (2002); Schriro v. Smith, 546 U.S. 6, 7 (2005). See Eighth Amendment, “Limi-
tations on Capital Punishment: Diminished Capacity,” infra.
     88 In Washington v. Recuenco, however, the Court held that “[f]ailure to submit

a sentencing factor to the jury, like failure to submit an element [of a crime] to the
jury, is not structural error,” entitling the defendant to automatic reversal, but can
be harmless error. 548 U.S. 212, 222 (2006).
     89 In James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192 (2007), the Court found no Sixth

Amendment issue raised when it considered “the elements of the offense . . . without
inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.” Id. at 202 (emphasis
in original). The question before the Court was whether, under federal law, at-
tempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, “presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another” and therefore constitutes a “violent felony,” subjecting
the defendant to a longer sentence. Id. at 196. In answering this question, the Court
employed the “categorical approach” of looking only to the statutory definition and
not considering the “particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction.” Id. at
202. Thus, “the Court [was] engaging in statutory interpretation, not judicial factfind-
ing,” and “[s]uch analysis raises no Sixth Amendment issue.” Id. at 214.
     90 For instance, the Court held that whether a defendant “visibly possessed a

gun” during a crime may be designated by a state as a sentencing factor, and deter-
mined by a judge based on the preponderance of evidence. McMillan v. Pennsylva-
nia, 477 U.S. 79 (1986). After resolving the issue under the Due Process Clause, the
Court dismissed the Sixth Amendment jury trial claim as “merit[ing] little discus-
sion.” Id. at 93. For more on the due process issue, see the discussion in “Proof,
Burden of Proof, and Presumptions,” infra.

     92 530 U.S. at 494. “[M]erely because the state legislature placed its hate crime

sentence enhancer within the sentencing provisions of the criminal code does not
mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element
of the offense.” Id. at 495 (internal quotation omitted).
