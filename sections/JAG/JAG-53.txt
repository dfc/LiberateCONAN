must be given a reasonable opportunity to employ and consult with
counsel; otherwise, the right to be heard by counsel would be of
little worth.” 292
    Though there is a presumption under the Sixth Amendment that
a defendant may retain counsel of choice, the right to choose a par-
ticular attorney is not absolute. The prospect of compromised loy-
alty or competence may be sufficiently immediate and serious for a
court to deny a defendant’s selection. In Wheat v. United States, the
district court had denied a defendant’s proffered waiver of conflict
of interest and refused to allow representation by an attorney who
represented the defendant’s co-conspirators in an illegal drug enter-
prise.293 Upholding the district court’s discretion to disallow repre-
sentation in instances of actual conflict of interests or serious poten-
tial for conflict, the Court mentioned other situations in which a
defendant’s choice may not be honored. A defendant, for example,
is not entitled to an advocate who is not a member of the bar, nor
may a defendant insist on representation by an attorney who de-
nies counsel for financial reasons or otherwise, nor may a defen-
dant demand the services of a lawyer who may be compromised by
past or ongoing relationships with the Government.294
    Also, the right to retain counsel of choice does not bar opera-
tion of forfeiture provisions, even if the result is to deny to a defen-
dant the wherewithal to employ counsel. In Caplin & Drysdale v.
United States,295 the Court upheld a federal statute requiring for-
feiture to the government of property and proceeds derived from
drug-related crimes constituting a “continuing criminal enter-
prise,” 296 even though a portion of the forfeited assets had been used
to retain defense counsel. Although a defendant may spend his own
money to employ counsel, the Court declared, “[a] defendant has
no Sixth Amendment right to spend another person’s money for ser-
vices rendered by an attorney, even if those funds are the only way
that defendant will be able to retain the attorney of his choice.” 297
Because the statute vests title to the forfeitable assets in the United
States at the time of the criminal act,298 the defendant has no right

ing no exception for assets the defendant intends to use for his defense.
