examination expose weaknesses in the prosecution’s case and thereby
save the defendant from being bound over, and could in any event
preserve for use in cross-examination at trial and impeachment pur-
poses testimony he could elicit at the hearing; he could discover as
much as possible of the prosecution’s case against defendant for bet-
ter trial preparation; and he could influence the court in such mat-
ters as bail and psychiatric examination. The result seems to be
that reached in pre-Gideon cases in which a defendant was en-
titled to counsel if a lawyer might have made a difference.362
     Custodial Interrogation.—At first, the Court followed the rule
of “fundamental fairness,” assessing whether under all the circum-
stances a defendant was so prejudiced by the denial of access to
counsel that his subsequent trial was tainted.363 It held in Spano
v. New York 364 that, under the totality of circumstances, a confes-
sion obtained in a post-indictment interrogation was involuntary,
and four Justices wished to place the holding solely on the basis
that post-indictment interrogation in the absence of defendant’s law-
yer was a denial of his right to assistance of counsel. The Court
issued that holding in Massiah v. United States,365 in which fed-
eral officers caused an informer to elicit from the already-indicted
defendant, who was represented by a lawyer, incriminating admis-
sions that were secretly overheard over a broadcasting unit. Then,
in Escobedo v. Illinois,366 the Court held that preindictment inter-
rogation violated the Sixth Amendment. But Miranda v. Ari-
zona 367 switched from reliance on the Sixth Amendment to reli-
ance on the Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause in cases
of pre-indictment custodial interrogation, although Miranda still placed

Massiah to the states, in a case not involving trickery but in which defendant was
endeavoring to cooperate with the police). But see Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S.
293 (1966). Cf. Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371 (1972). In Kansas v. Ventris, 556
U.S. ___, No. 07–1356, slip op. at 5 (Apr. 29, 2009), the Court “conclude[d] that the
Massiah right is a right to be free of uncounseled interrogation, and is infringed at
the time of the interrogation,” not merely if and when the defendant’s statement is
admitted into evidence.
