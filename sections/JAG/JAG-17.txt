tional right to a jury trial, even if the aggregate of sentences autho-
rized for the offense exceeds six months.80
    The Court has also made some changes in the meaning of the
term “criminal proceeding.” Previously, the term had been applied
only to situations in which a person has been accused of an offense
by information or presentment.81 Thus, a civil action to collect statu-
tory penalties and punitive damages, because not technically crimi-
nal, has been held not to implicate the right to jury trial.82 Subse-
quently, however, the Court focused its analysis on the character of
the sanction to be imposed, holding that punitive sanctions may not
be imposed without adhering to the guarantees of the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments.83 There is, however, no constitutional right to a jury
trial in juvenile proceedings, at least in state systems and probably
in the federal system as well.84
    In a long line of cases, the Court had held that no constitu-
tional right to jury trial existed in trials of criminal contempt.85 In
Bloom v. Illinois,86 however, the Court announced that “[o]ur delib-
erations have convinced us . . . that serious contempts are so nearly
like other serious crimes that they are subject to the jury trial pro-
visions of the Constitution . . . and that the traditional rule is con-
stitutionally infirm insofar as it permits other than petty contempts
to be tried without honoring a demand for a jury trial.” The Court
has consistently held, however, that a jury is not required for pur-

     83 Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963). The statute at issue in

Mendoza-Martinez automatically divested an American of citizenship for departing
or remaining outside the United States to evade military service. A later line of cases,
beginning in 1967, held that the Fourteenth Amendment broadly barred Congress
from involuntarily expatriating any citizen who was born in the United States.

United States v. Burnett, 376 U.S. 681, 692–700 (1964), and cases cited. A Court
plurality in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373 (1966), held, asserting the Court’s
supervisory power over the lower federal courts, that criminal contempt sentences
in excess of six months imprisonment could not be imposed without a jury trial or
adequate waiver.

As in other cases, the Court drew the line between serious and petty offenses at six
months, but because, unlike other offenses, no maximum punishments are usually
provided for contempts it indicated the actual penalty imposed should be looked to.
Id. at 211. See also Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216 (1968). The
distinction between criminal and civil contempt may be somewhat more elusive. In-
ternational Union, UMW v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821 (1994) (fines levied on the union
were criminal in nature where the conduct did not occur in the court’s presence, the
court’s injunction required compliance with an entire code of conduct, and the fines
assessed were not compensatory).
