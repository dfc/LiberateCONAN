    Because even the most highly competent attorneys might choose
to defend a client differently, “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s perfor-
mance must be highly deferential.” 324 Counsel’s obligation is a gen-
eral one: to act within the wide range of legitimate, lawful, and rea-
sonable conduct. 325 “[S]trategic choices made after thorough
investigation of relevant law and facts . . . are virtually unchallenge-
able,” 326 as is “a reasonable decision that makes particular investi-
gations unnecessary,” 327 or a reasonable decision selecting which is-
sues to raise on appeal.328 In Strickland itself, the allegation of
ineffective assistance failed: The Court found that the defense attor-
ney’s decision to forgo character and psychological evidence in a capi-
tal sentencing proceeding to avoid rebuttal evidence of the defen-
dant’s criminal history was “the result of reasonable professional
judgment.” 329
    On the other hand, defense counsel does have a general duty
to investigate a defendant’s background, and limiting investigation
and presentation of mitigating evidence must be supported by rea-
sonable efforts and judgment.330 Also, even though deference to coun-

ABA guidelines, and also noted that its holding “should not be regarded as accept-
ing the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the [2003] Guidelines to evaluate post-
2003 representation.” . 558 U.S. ___, No. 09–144, slip op. at 5 n.1 (2009) (per curiam).
     324 Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. The purpose is “not to improve the quality of

legal representation, . . . [but] simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a
fair trial.” Id.
     325 There is no obligation to assist the defendant in presenting perjured testi-

mony, Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), and a defendant has no right to re-
quire his counsel to use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race.
Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992). Also, “effective” assistance of counsel does
not guarantee the accused a “meaningful relationship” of “rapport” with his attor-
ney such that he is entitled to a continuance in order to change attorneys during a
trial. Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1 (1983).
     326 Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. See also Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1 (2003)

(deference to attorney’s choice of tactics for closing argument).
     327 Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691. See also Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19 (2002)

(state courts could reasonably have concluded that failure to present mitigating evi-
dence was outweighed by “severe” aggravating factors); Schriro v. Landrigan, 550
U.S. 465 (2007) (federal district court was within its discretion to conclude that at-
torney’s failure to present mitigating evidence made no difference in sentencing).
     328 There is no obligation to present on appeal all nonfrivolous issues requested

by the defendant. Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983) (appointed counsel may ex-
ercise his professional judgment in determining which issues are best raised on ap-
peal).
     329 466 U.S. at 699. Accord Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U.S. ___, No. 08–1263 (2009)

(per curiam); Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168 (1986) (decision not to introduce
mitigating evidence).
     330 See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003) (attorney’s failure to pursue defen-

dant’s personal history and present important mitigating evidence at capital sentenc-
ing was objectively unreasonable); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005) (attor-
neys’ failure to consult trial transcripts from a prior conviction that the attorneys
knew the prosecution would rely on in arguing for the death penalty was inad-
equate); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. ___, No. 08–10537, slip op. (2009) (per curiam)
