reprising his opinion stated in earlier cases 232 that the Confronta-
tion Clause covers only formalized statements of a solemnity that
the uncertified lab report in this case lacked.
    Generally, the only exceptions to the right of confrontation that
the Court has acknowledged are the two that existed under com-
mon law at the time of the founding: “declarations made by a speaker
who was both on the brink of death and aware that he was dying,”
and “statements of a witness who was ‘detained’ or ‘kept away’ by
the ‘means or procurement’ of the defendant.” 233 The second of these
exceptions applies “only when the defendant engaged in conduct de-
signed to prevent the witness from testifying.” 234 Thus, in a trial
for murder, the question arose whether statements made by the vic-
tim to a police officer three weeks before she was murdered, that
the defendant had threatened her, could be admitted. The state court
had admitted them on the basis that the defendant’s having mur-
dered the victim had made the victim unavailable to testify, but the
Supreme Court reversed, holding that, unless the testimony had been
confronted or fell within the dying declaration exception, it could
not be admitted “on the basis of a prior judicial assessment that
the defendant is guilty as charged,” for to admit it on that basis it
would “not sit well with the right to trial by jury.” 235
    In Davis v. Washington,236 the Court began to explore the pa-
rameters of Crawford by considering when a police interrogation is
“testimonial” for purposes of the Confrontation Clause. Davis in-
volved a 911 call in which a woman described being assaulted by a
former boyfriend. A tape of that call was admitted as evidence of a
felony violation of a domestic no-contact order, despite the fact that
the woman in question did not testify. Although again declining to
establish all the parameters of when a response to police interroga-
tion is testimonial, the Court held that statements to the police are
nontestimonial when made under circumstances that “objectively in-
dicat[e] that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable
police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.” 237 Statements made
