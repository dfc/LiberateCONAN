less he has or waives the assistance of counsel.” 268 Any waiver, the
Court ruled, must be by the intelligent choice of the defendant, will
not be presumed from a silent record, and must be determined by
the trial court before proceeding in the absence of counsel.269
     An effort to obtain the same rule in the state courts in all crimi-
nal proceedings was rebuffed in Betts v. Brady.270 Justice Roberts
for the Court observed that the Sixth Amendment would compel the
result only in federal courts but that in state courts the Due Pro-
cess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “formulates a concept
less rigid and more fluid” than those guarantees embodied in the
Bill of Rights, although a state denial of a right protected in one of
the first eight Amendments might “in certain circumstances” be a
violation of due process. The question was rather “whether the con-
straint laid by the Amendment upon the national courts expresses
a rule so fundamental and essential to a fair trial, and so, to due
process of law, that it is made obligatory upon the States by the
Fourteenth Amendment.” 271 Examining the common-law rules, the
English practice, and the state constitutions, laws and practices, the
Court concluded that it was the “considered judgment of the people,
their representatives and their courts that appointment of counsel
is not a fundamental right essential to a fair trial.” Want of coun-
sel in a particular case might result in a conviction lacking in fun-
damental fairness and so necessitate the interposition of constitu-
tional restriction upon state practice, but this was not the general
rule.272 Justice Black in dissent argued that the Fourteenth Amend-
ment made the Sixth applicable to the states and required the ap-
pointment of counsel, but that even on the Court’s terms counsel
was a fundamental right and appointment was required by due pro-
cess.273
     Over time the Court abandoned the “special circumstances” lan-
guage of Powell v. Alabama 274 when capital cases were involved and
    268  304 U.S. at 462, 463.
    269  304 U.S. at 464–65. The standards for a valid waiver were tightened in Walker
v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275 (1941), setting aside a guilty plea made without assis-
tance of counsel, by a ruling requiring that a defendant appearing in court be ad-
vised of his right to counsel and asked whether or not he wished to waive the right.
See also Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708 (1948); Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S.
506 (1962). A waiver must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, but need not be
based on a full and complete understanding of all of the consequences. Iowa v. Tovar,
541 U.S. 77 (2004) (holding that warnings by trial judge detailing risks of waiving
right to counsel are not constitutionally required before accepting guilty plea from
uncounseled defendant).
     270 316 U.S. 455 (1942).
     271 316 U.S. at 461–62, 465.
     272 316 U.S. at 471, 473.
     273 316 U.S. at 474 (joined by Justices Douglas and Murphy).
     274 287 U.S. 45, 71 (1932).
