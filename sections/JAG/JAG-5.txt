Justice, nor the meane, whereby we may attaine to the end, and
that is the law.” 14 Much the same language was incorporated into
the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 15 and from there into
the Sixth Amendment. The right to a speedy trial is a right of an
accused, but it serves the interests of defendants and society alike.
The provision is “an important safeguard to prevent undue and op-
pressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and con-
cern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibility that
long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend him-
self.” 16 But on the other hand, “there is a societal interest in pro-
viding a speedy trial which exists separate from and at times in
opposition to the interests of the accused.” Persons in jail must be
supported at considerable public expense and often families must
be assisted as well. Persons free in the community after arrest may
commit other crimes, lengthy intervals between arrest and trial may
promote “bail jumping,” and growing backlogs of cases may moti-
vate plea bargaining that does not always match society’s expecta-
tions for justice. And delay may retard the deterrent and rehabili-
tative effects of the criminal law.17
     Application and Scope.—“The history of the right to a speedy
trial and its reception in this country clearly establish that it is
one of the most basic rights preserved by our Constitution.” So find-
ing, the Supreme Court held in the 1967 case of Klopfer v. North
Carolina that the right to a speedy trial is one of those “fundamen-
tal” liberties that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment makes applicable to the states.18 But beyond its widespread
applicability in state and federal prosecutions are questions of when
the right attaches, when it is violated, and how violations may be
remedied.

may include an extended period for gathering evidence and decid-
