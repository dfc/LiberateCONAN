The Court continues to view as “presumptively unreliable accom-
plices’ confessions that incriminate defendants.” 213
     Then, in 1970, the Court refused to equate the Confrontation
Clause with hearsay rules. “While . . . hearsay rules and the Con-
frontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values,
it is quite a different thing to suggest that the overlap is complete
and that the Confrontation Clause is nothing more or less than a
codification of the rules of hearsay and their exceptions as they ex-
isted historically at common law. Our decisions have never estab-
lished such a congruence; indeed, we have more than once found a
violation of confrontation values even though the statements in is-
sue were admitted under an arguably recognized hearsay excep-
tion. The converse is equally true: merely because evidence is ad-
mitted in violation of a long-established hearsay rule does not lead
to the automatic conclusion that confrontation rights have been de-
nied.” 214 In holding admissible a statement made to police during
custodial interrogation, the Court explained that “[T]he Confronta-
tion Clause does not require excluding from evidence the prior state-
ments of a witness who concedes making the statements, and who
may be asked to defend or otherwise explain the inconsistency be-
tween his prior and his present version of the events in question,
thus opening himself to full cross-examination at trial as to both
stories.” 215
    The Court favored a hearsay exception over a cross-examination
requirement in Dutton v. Evans,216 upholding the use as substan-
tive evidence at trial of a statement made by a witness whom the
prosecution could have produced but did not.217 Presentation of a
    213   Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530, 541 (1986); Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 132
(1999).
     214 California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 155–56 (1970) (citations omitted) (holding

statement admissible because the witness was present at trial and could have been
cross-examined then). See also Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 80–86 (1970) (plural-
ity opinion by Justice Stewart). Compare id. at 94–95 (Justice Harlan concurring),
with id. at 105 n.7 (Justice Marshall dissenting).
     215 California v. Green, 399 U.S. at 164. Justice Brennan dissented. Id. at 189.

See also Nelson v. O’Neil, 402 U.S. 622 (1971). “The Confrontation Clause includes
no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving
testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion. To the contrary,
the Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and
fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination.”
Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 21–22 (1985) (per curiam) (expert witness testi-
fied as to conclusion, but could not remember basis for conclusion). See also United
States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554 (1988) (testimony as to a previous, out-of-court iden-
tification statement is not barred by witness’ inability, due to memory loss, to ex-
plain the basis for his identification).
     216 400 U.S. 74 (1970).
     217 The statement was made by an alleged co-conspirator of the defendant and

was admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.
