to give them to a “third party” even if the purpose is to exercise a
constitutionally protected right.299
    Nevertheless, where the right to be assisted by counsel of one’s
choice is wrongly denied, a Sixth Amendment violation occurs re-
gardless of whether the alternate counsel retained was effective, or
whether the denial caused prejudice to the defendant.300 Further,
because such a denial is not a “trial error” (a constitutional error
that occurs during presentation of a case to the jury), but a “struc-
tural defect” (a constitutional error that affects the framework of
the trial),301 the Court had held that the decision is not subject to
a “harmless error” analysis.302
    Effective Assistance of Counsel.—“[T]he right to counsel is
the right to the effective assistance of counsel.” 303 This right to ef-
fective assistance has two aspects. First, a court may not restrict
defense counsel in the exercise of the representational duties and
prerogatives attendant to our adversarial system of justice.304 Sec-
ond, defense counsel can deprive a defendant of effective assistance
by failing to provide competent representation that is adequate to
ensure a fair trial,305 or, more broadly, a just outcome.306 The right
to effective assistance may be implicated as early as the appoint-
ment process. Cases requiring appointment of counsel for indigent
defendants hold that, as a matter of due process, the assignment of
defense counsel must be timely and made in a manner that affords

     299 Dissenting Justice Blackmun, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Ste-

vens, described the Court’s ruling as allowing the Sixth Amendment right to coun-
sel of choice to be “outweighed by a legal fiction.” 491 U.S. at 644 (dissenting from
both Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto).

     301 Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307–310 (1991).
     302 Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 148–49. The Court noted that an important com-

ponent of the finding that denial of the right to choose one’s own counsel was a
“structural defect” was the difficulty of assessing the effect of such denial on a tri-
al’s outcome. Id. at 149 n.4.
     303 McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 (1970). “[I]f the right to coun-

sel guaranteed by the Constitution is to serve its purpose, defendants cannot be left
to the mercies of incompetent counsel . . . .” 397 U.S. at 771. As a corollary, there is
no Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance where there is no Sixth Amend-
ment right to counsel. Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586 (1982) (summarily holding
that defendant may not raise ineffective assistance claim in context of proceeding in
which he had no constitutional right to counsel).

tation between defendant and attorney overnight); Herring v. New York, 422 U.S.

tion).
