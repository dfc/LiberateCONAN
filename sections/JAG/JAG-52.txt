mines the presumption of reliability that attaches to a judgment of
a court, Gideon has been held fully retroactive, so that convictions
obtained in the absence of counsel without a valid waiver are not
only voidable,287 but also may not be subsequently used either to
support guilt in a new trial or to enhance punishment upon a valid
conviction.288
    Limits on the Right to Retained Counsel.—Gideon v. Wain-
wright 289 is regarded as having consolidated a right to counsel at
trial in the Sixth Amendment, be the trial federal or state or coun-
sel retained or appointed.290 The Sixth Amendment cases, together
with pre-Gideon cases that applied due process analysis under the
Fourteenth Amendment to state proceedings, point to an unques-
tioned right to retain counsel for the course of a prosecution, but
also to circumstances in which the choice of a particular represen-
tative must give way to the right’s fundamental purpose of ensur-
ing the integrity of the adversary trial system.
     The pre-Gideon cases often spoke of the right to retain counsel
expansively. Thus, in Chandler v. Fretag, when a defendant appear-
ing in court to plead guilty to house-breaking was advised for the
first time that, because of three prior convictions, he could be sen-
tenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender, the court’s de-
nial of his request for a continuance to consult an attorney was a
violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.291 “Re-
gardless of whether petitioner would have been entitled to the ap-
pointment of counsel, his right to be heard through his own coun-
sel was unqualified. . . . A necessary corollary is that a defendant

     288 Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109 (1967) (admission of record of prior conviction

without the assistance of counsel at trial, with instruction to jury to regard it only
for purposes of determining sentence if it found defendant guilty, but not to use it
in considering guilt, was inherently prejudicial); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S.
443 (1972) (error for sentencing judge in 1953 to have relied on two previous convic-
tions at which defendant was without counsel); Loper v. Beto, 405 U.S. 473 (1972)
(error to have permitted counseled defendant in 1947 trial to have his credibility
impeached by introduction of prior uncounseled convictions in the 1930s; Chief Jus-
tice Burger and Justices Blackmun, Powell, and Rehnquist dissented); But see Nich-
ols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994) (as Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979)
provides that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid if defendant is not
incarcerated, such a conviction may be used as the basis for penalty enhancement
upon a subsequent conviction).
