miss for cause a prospective juror prejudiced in favor of the death
penalty does not deprive a defendant of his right to trial by an im-
partial jury if he is able to exclude the juror through exercise of a
peremptory challenge.154 The relevant inquiry is “on the jurors who
ultimately sat,” the Court declared, rejecting as overly broad the
assertion in Gray that the focus instead should be on “ ‘whether the
composition of the jury panel as a whole could have been affected
by the trial court’s error.’ ” 155
     It is the function of the voir dire to give the defense and the
prosecution the opportunity to inquire into, or have the trial judge
inquire into, possible grounds of bias or prejudice that potential ju-
rors may have, and to acquaint the parties with the potential ju-
rors.156 It is good ground for challenge for cause that a juror has
formed an opinion on the issue to be tried, but not every opinion
which a juror may entertain necessarily disqualifies him. The judge
must determine whether the nature and strength of the opinion raise
a presumption against impartiality.157 It suffices for the judge to
question potential jurors about their ability to put aside what they
had heard or read about the case, listen to the evidence with an
open mind, and render an impartial verdict; the judge’s refusal to
go further and question jurors about the contents of news reports
to which they had been exposed did not violate the Sixth Amend-
ment.158
     Under some circumstances, it may be constitutionally required
that questions specifically directed to the existence of racial bias
must be asked. Thus, in a situation in which defendant, a black
man, alleged that he was being prosecuted on false charges be-
cause of his civil rights activities in an atmosphere perhaps open
to racial appeals, prospective jurors must be asked about their ra-
cial prejudice, if any.159 A similar rule applies in some capital tri-
als, where the risk of racial prejudice “is especially serious in light
of the complete finality of the death sentence.” A defendant accused
of an interracial capital offense is entitled to have prospective ju-
rors informed of the victim’s race and questioned as to racial bias.160
