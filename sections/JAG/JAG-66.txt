great emphasis upon police warnings of the right to counsel and
foreclosure of interrogation in the absence of counsel without a valid
waiver by defendant.368
    Massiah was reaffirmed and in some respects expanded by the
Court. In Brewer v. Williams,369 the right to counsel was found vio-
lated when police elicited from defendant incriminating admissions
not through formal questioning but rather through a series of con-
versational openings designed to play on the defendant’s known weak-
ness. The police conduct occurred in the post-arraignment period
in the absence of defense counsel and despite assurances to the at-
torney that defendant would not be questioned in his absence. In
United States v. Henry,370 the Court held that government agents
violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel when they con-
tacted the cellmate of an indicted defendant and promised him pay-
ment under a contingent fee arrangement if he would “pay atten-
tion” to incriminating remarks initiated by the defendant and others.
The Court concluded that, even if the government agents did not
intend the informant to take affirmative steps to elicit incriminat-
ing statements from the defendant in the absence of counsel, the
agents must have known that that result would follow.
    The Court extended the Edwards v. Arizona 371 rule protecting
in-custody requests for counsel to post-arraignment situations where
the right derives from the Sixth Amendment rather than the Fifth.
In the subsequently overruled Michigan v. Jackson, the Court held
that, “if police initiate interrogation after a defendant’s assertion,
at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any
waiver of the defendant’s right to counsel for that police-initiated
interrogation is invalid.” 372 The Court concluded that “the reasons
for prohibiting the interrogation of an uncounseled prisoner who has
asked for the help of a lawyer are even stronger after he has been

     368 The different issues in Fifth and Sixth Amendment cases were summarized

in Fellers v. United States, 540 U.S. 519 (2004), which held that absence of an inter-
rogation is irrelevant in a Massiah-based Sixth Amendment inquiry.

per se rule that, regardless of the circumstances, “if an undercover agent meets with
a criminal defendant who is awaiting trial and with his attorney and if the forthcom-
ing trial is discussed without the agent revealing his identity, a violation of the de-
fendant’s constitutional rights has occurred . . . ”).
