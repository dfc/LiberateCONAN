statutory limits, but the Court made “clear . . . that the ‘statutory
maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge
may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury ver-
dict or admitted by the defendant. In other words, the relevant ‘statu-
tory maximum’ is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose
after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose with-
out any additional findings.” 99
    Then, in United States v. Booker,100 the Court held that the same
principles limit sentences that courts may impose under the fed-
eral Sentencing Guidelines.101 As the Court restated the principle
in Booker, “[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is neces-
sary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by
the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be
admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt.” 102 Attempts to distinguish Blakely were rejected. The Court
concluded that the fact that the Guidelines were developed by the
Sentencing Commission rather than by Congress “lacks constitu-
tional significance.” 103 Instead, the Guidelines were suspect in ap-
plication because, on the one hand, they curtailed the role of jury
factfinding in determining the upper range of a sentence and, on
the other hand, they mandated sentences from which a court could
depart only in a limited number of cases and after separately find-
ing the existence of factors not presented to the jury.104 The manda-
tory nature of the Guidelines was also important to the Court’s for-
mulation of a remedy. 105 Rather than engrafting a jury trial

Co. v. United States, 567 U.S. ___, No. 11–94, slip op. (2012), the Court cited this
passage in Blakely as a springboard to its conclusion that the Apprendi line of cases
apply in imposing criminal fines. The maximum fine that could be imposed in South-
ern Union Co. was pegged to the number of days a violation continued, but the jury
was not asked to determine the duration of the violation. The Court saw no “prin-
cipled basis” for treating criminal fines differently from imprisonment or capital pun-
ishment. In all these cases, the Sixth Amendment guards against “judicial factfind-
ing that enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces beyond what the jury’s
verdict or the defendant’s admissions allow.”

     101 Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the United States Sentencing Com-

mission adopted binding Sentencing Guidelines, and courts were required to impose
sentences within the narrow, defined ranges. A judge could depart from the appli-
cable Guideline only upon finding in writing that an aggravating or mitigating fac-
tor was present that had not adequately been considered by the Commission. See
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989).
     102 543 U.S. at 244.
     103 543 U.S. at 237. Relying on Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989),

the Court also rejected a separation-of-powers argument. Id. at 754–55.
     104 543 U.S. at 233–35.
     105 There were two distinct opinions of the Court in Booker. The first, authored

by Justice Stevens and joined by Justices Scalia, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg (the
same Justices who comprised the five-Justice Blakely majority), applied Blakely to
