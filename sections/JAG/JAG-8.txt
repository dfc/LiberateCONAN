witness would justify an appropriate delay, and such factors as crowded
dockets and negligence will fall between these other factors.29 It is
the duty of the prosecution to bring a defendant to trial, and the
failure of the defendant to demand the right is not to be construed
as a waiver of the right.30 Yet, the defendant’s acquiescence in de-
lay when it works to his advantage should be considered against
his later assertion that he was denied the guarantee, while the de-
fendant’s responsibility for delay may preclude a claim altogether.
A delay caused by assigned counsel should generally be attributed
to the defendant, not to the state. However, “[d]elay resulting from
a systemic ‘breakdown in the public defender system’ could be charged
to the State.” 31 Finally, a court should look to the possible preju-
dices and disadvantages suffered by a defendant during a delay.32

Public Trial
    “The traditional Anglo-American distrust for secret trials has
been variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the
Spanish Inquisition, to the excesses of the English Court of Star
Chamber, and to the French monarchy’s abuse of the letter de ca-
chet. All of these institutions obviously symbolized a menace to lib-
erty. . . . Whatever other benefits the guarantee to an accused that
his trial be conducted in public may confer upon our society, the
guarantee has always been recognized as a safeguard against any
attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.” 33
    The Supreme Court has cited many civic and process-related
purposes served by open trials: they help to ensure the criminal
defendant a fair and accurate adjudication of guilt or innocence; they
     29 Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 531 (1972). Delays caused by the prosecu-

tion’s interlocutory appeal will be judged by the Barker factors, of which the second—
the reason for the appeal—is the most important. United States v. Loud Hawk, 474
U.S. 302 (1986) (no denial of speedy trial, since prosecution’s position on appeal was
strong, and there was no showing of bad faith or dilatory purpose). If the interlocu-
tory appeal is taken by the defendant, he must “bear the heavy burden of showing
an unreasonable delay caused by the prosecution [or] wholly unjustifiable delay by
the appellate court” in order to win dismissal on speedy trial grounds. Id. at 316.
     30 Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 528. See generally id. at 523–29. Waiver is “an

intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,” Johnson
v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938), and it is not to be presumed but must appear
from the record to have been intelligently and understandingly made. Carnley v.
Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 516 (1962).
