Constitution does not require the government to furnish a copy of
the indictment to an accused.195 The right to notice of accusation is
so fundamental a part of procedural due process that the states are
required to observe it.196

                          CONFRONTATION
    “The primary object of the [Confrontation Clause is] to prevent
depositions of ex parte affidavits . . . being used against the pris-
oner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the
witness in which the accused has an opportunity not only of test-
ing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of
compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that
they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand
and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is wor-
thy of belief.” 197 The right of confrontation is “[o]ne of the funda-
mental guarantees of life and liberty . . . long deemed so essential
for the due protection of life and liberty that it is guarded against
legislative and judicial action by provisions in the Constitution of
the United States and in the constitutions of most if not of all the
States composing the Union.” 198 Before 1965, when the Court held
the right to be protected against state abridgment,199 it had little
need to clarify the relationship between the right of confrontation
and the hearsay rule,200 because it could control the admission of
hearsay through exercise of its supervisory powers over the infe-
rior federal courts.201
    On the basis of the Confrontation Clause, the Court had con-
cluded that evidence given at a preliminary hearing could not be
used at the trial if the absence of the witness was attributable to
the negligence of the prosecution,202 but that if a witness’ absence

U.S. 400, 404–05 (1965). The right may be waived but it must be a knowing, intelli-
gent waiver uncoerced from defendant. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1 (1966).

     200 Hearsay is the prior out-of-court statements of a person, offered affirma-

tively for the truth of the matters asserted, presented at trial either orally by an-
other person or in writing. Hickory v. United States, 151 U.S. 303, 309 (1894); South-
ern Ry. v. Gray, 241 U.S. 333, 337 (1916); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135 (1945).

say rule was consistent with the Confrontation Clause, Delaney v. United States,
263 U.S. 586, 590 (1924), the Court’s formulation of the exception and its limita-
tions was pursuant to its supervisory powers. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S.
604 (1953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949).
