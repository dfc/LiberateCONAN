ing to commence a prosecution. Prejudice that may result from de-
lays between discovering a crime and completing its investigation,
or between discovering sufficient evidence to proceed against a sus-
pect and instituting proceedings, is guarded against primarily by
statutes of limitation, which represent a legislative judgment with
regard to permissible periods of delay.19 The protection afforded by
the speedy trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment “is activated
only when a criminal prosecution has begun and extends only to
those persons who have been ‘accused’ in the course of that prosecu-
tion.” 20 Nevertheless, invocation of the right need not always await
indictment, information, or other formal charge but can begin with
the actual restraints imposed by arrest if those restraints precede
the formal preferring of charges.21 In two cases involving both de-
tention and formal charges, the Court held that the speedy trial
guarantee had been violated by states that brought criminal charges
against persons who were already incarcerated in prisons of other
jurisdictions when the states that brought the criminal charges had
ignored the defendants’ requests to be given prompt trials and had
made no effort through requests to the prison authorities of the other
jurisdictions to obtain custody of the prisoners for purposes of trial.22
But an individual’s speedy trial rights can be at issue even when
he is not subject to detention and it is uncertain whether the gov-
ernment will ever pursue further prosecution. Thus, a state prac-

Toussie, 397 U.S. 112, 114–15 (1970). In some circumstances, pre-accusation delay
could constitute a due process violation but not a speedy trial problem. If prejudice
results to a defendant because of the government’s delay, a court should balance the
degree of prejudice against the reasons for delay given by the prosecution. Marion,
404 U.S. at 324; United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783 (1977); United States v.
MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8 (1982).
     20 United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 313 (1971). Justices Douglas, Bren-

nan, and Marshall disagreed, arguing that the “right to a speedy trial is the right
to be brought to trial speedily which would seem to be as relevant to pretrial indict-
ment delays as it is to post-indictment delays,” but concurring because they did not
think the guarantee violated under the facts of the case. Id. at 328. In United States
v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1 (1982), the Court held the clause was not implicated by
the action of the United States when, in May of 1970, it proceeded with a charge of
murder against defendant under military law but dismissed the charge in October
of that year, and he was discharged in December. In June of 1972, the investigation
was reopened, but a grand jury was not convened until August of 1974, and MacDonald
was not indicted until January of 1975. The period between dismissal of the first
charge and the later indictment had none of the characteristics which called for ap-
plication of the speedy trial clause. Only the period between arrest and indictment
must be considered in evaluating a speedy trial claim. Marion and MacDonald were
applied in United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), holding the speedy
trial guarantee inapplicable to the period during which the government appealed
dismissal of an indictment, since during that time the suspect had not been subject
to bail or otherwise restrained.
