exclusionary rule can apply as well to the Sixth. In Nix v. Wil-
liams,384 the Court held the “inevitable discovery” exception appli-
cable to defeat exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of an in-
terrogation violating the accused’s Sixth Amendment rights. “Exclusion
of physical evidence that would inevitably have been discovered adds
nothing to either the integrity or fairness of a criminal trial.” 385
Also, an exception to the Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule has
been recognized for the purpose of impeaching the defendant’s trial
testimony.386
     Lineups and Other Identification Situations.—The concept
of the “critical stage” was again expanded and its rationale formu-
lated in United States v. Wade,387 which, with Gilbert v. Califor-
nia,388 held that lineups are a critical stage and that in-court iden-
tification of defendants based on out-of-court lineups or show-ups
without the presence of defendant’s counsel is inadmissible. The Sixth
Amendment guarantee, said Justice Brennan, was intended to do
away with the common-law limitation of assistance of counsel to
matters of law, excluding matters of fact. The abolition of the fact-
law distinction took on new importance due to the changes in inves-
tigation and prosecution since adoption of the Sixth Amendment.
“When the Bill of Rights was adopted, there were no organized po-
lice forces as we know them today. The accused confronted the pros-
ecutor and the witnesses against him, and the evidence was mar-
shaled, largely at the trial itself. In contrast, today’s law enforcement
machinery involves critical confrontations of the accused by the pros-
ecution at pretrial proceedings where the results might well settle
the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality. In
recognition of these realities of modern criminal prosecution, our
cases have construed the Sixth Amendment guarantee to apply to
‘critical’ stages of the proceedings. . . . The plain wording of this
guarantee thus encompasses counsel’s assistance whenever neces-
sary to assure a meaningful ‘defence.’ ” 389
     “It is central to [the principle of Powell v. Alabama] that in ad-
dition to counsel’s presence at trial, the accused is guaranteed that
