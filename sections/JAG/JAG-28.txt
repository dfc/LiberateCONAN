the death penalty, no less than one who favors it, can make the
discretionary judgment entrusted to him by the State and can thus
obey the oath he takes as a juror.” 142 A jury, the Court wrote, must
“express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question
of life or death,” and the automatic exclusion of all with general-
ized objections to the death penalty “stacked the deck” and made of
the jury a tribunal “organized to return a verdict of death.” 143 A
court may not refuse a defendant’s request to examine potential ju-
rors to determine whether they would vote automatically to impose
the death penalty; general questions about fairness and willing-
ness to follow the law are inadequate.144
     In Wainwright v. Witt, the Court held that the proper standard
for exclusion is “whether the juror’s views would ‘prevent or sub-
stantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accor-
dance with his instructions and his oath.’ ” 145 Thus, to be excluded,
a juror need not indicate that he would “automatic[ally]” vote against
the death penalty, nor need his “bias be proved with ‘unmistakable
clarity.’ ” 146 Persons properly excludable under Witherspoon may also
be excluded from the guilt/innocence phase of a bifurcated capital
trial.147 It had been argued that to exclude such persons from the
guilt/innocence phase would result in a jury somewhat more predis-
posed to convict, and that this would deny the defendant a jury cho-
sen from a fair cross-section. The Court rejected this argument, con-
cluding that “it is simply not possible to define jury impartiality
. . . by reference to some hypothetical mix of individual view-
points.” 148 Moreover, the state has “an entirely proper interest in
obtaining a single jury that could impartially decide all of the is-
sues in [a] case,” and need not select separate panels and duplicate

    143  391 U.S. at 519, 521, 523. The Court thought the problem went only to the
issue of the sentence imposed and saw no evidence that a jury from which death-
scrupled persons had been excluded was more prone to convict than were juries on
which such person sat. Cf. Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 545 (1968).
Witherspoon was given added significance when, in Woodson v. North Carolina, 428
U.S. 280 (1976), and Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325 (1976), the Court held man-
datory death sentences unconstitutional and ruled that the jury as a representative
of community mores must make the determination as guided by legislative stan-
dards. See also Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38 (1980) (holding Witherspoon applicable
to bifurcated capital sentencing procedures and voiding a statute permitting exclu-
sion of any juror unable to swear that the existence of the death penalty would not
affect his deliberations on any issue of fact).

standing based on previous questioning of other jurors).
