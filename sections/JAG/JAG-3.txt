   RIGHTS OF ACCUSED IN CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS


                            SIXTH AMENDMENT
    In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State
and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which
district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to
be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be con-
fronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory pro-
cess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assis-
tance of Counsel for his defense.
                               CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS

        Coverage
             Like with other provisions of the Bill of Rights, the application
        of the Sixth Amendment evolved. In considering a bill of rights in
        August 1789, the House of Representatives adopted a proposal to
        guarantee a right to a jury trial in state prosecutions,1 but the Sen-
        ate rejected the proposal, and the 1869 case of Twitchell v. Common-
        wealth ended any doubt that the states were beyond the direct reach
        of the Sixth Amendment.2 The reach of the Amendment thus being
        then confined to federal courts, questions arose as to its applica-
        tion in federally established courts not located within a state. The
        Court found that criminal prosecutions in the District of Colum-
        bia 3 and in incorporated territories 4 must conform to the Amend-
        ment, but those in the unincorporated territories need not.5 Under
        the Consular cases, of which the leading case is In re Ross, the Court
        at one time held that the Sixth Amendment reached only citizens
        and others within the United States or brought to the United States

        the Insular Cases, De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901); and Downes v. Bidwell,
        182 U.S. 244 (1901), concerned with the “Constitution and the Advance of the Flag,”
