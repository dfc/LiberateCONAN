for trial, and not to citizens residing or temporarily sojourning abroad.6
Reid v. Covert made this holding inapplicable to proceedings abroad
by United States authorities against American civilians.7 Further,
though not applicable to the states by the Amendment’s terms, the
Court has come to protect all the rights guaranteed in the Sixth
Amendment against state abridgment through the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.8
     The Sixth Amendment applies in criminal prosecutions. Only
those acts that Congress has forbidden, with penalties for disobedi-
ence of its command, are crimes.9 Actions to recover penalties im-
posed by act of Congress generally but not invariably have been
held not to be criminal prosecutions,10 nor are deportation proceed-
ings,11, nor appeals or post-conviction applications for collateral re-
lief,12 but contempt proceedings, which at one time were not consid-
ered criminal prosecutions, are now considered to be criminal
prosecutions for purposes of the Amendment.13

             RIGHT TO A SPEEDY AND PUBLIC TRIAL

Speedy Trial
    Source and Rationale.—The Magna Carta declared “[w]ee shall
not . . . deny or delay Justice and right, neither the end, which is
     6 In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453 (1891) (holding that a United States citizen has no

right to a jury in a trial before a United States consul abroad for a crime committed
within a foreign nation).
     7 354 U.S. 1 (1957) (holding that civilian dependents of members of the Armed

Forces overseas could not constitutionally be tried by court-martial in time of peace
for capital offenses committed abroad). Four Justices, Black, Douglas, Brennan, and
Chief Justice Warren, disapproved Ross as “resting . . . on a fundamental miscon-
ception” that the Constitution did not limit the actions of the United States Govern-
ment against United States citizens abroad, id. at 5–6, 10–12, and evinced some
doubt with regard to the Insular Cases as well. Id. at 12–14. Justices Frankfurter
and Harlan, concurring, would not accept these strictures, but were content to limit
Ross to its particular factual situation and to distinguish the Insular Cases. Id. at
41, 65. Cf. Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25, 33–42 (1976) (declining to decide whether
there is a right to counsel in a court-martial, but ruling that the summary court-
martial involved in the case was not a “criminal prosecution” within the meaning of
the Amendment).
