the authority to exercise it, as when the defendant simply lacks the
competence to make a knowing or intelligent waiver of counsel or
when his self-representation is so disruptive of orderly procedures
that the judge may curtail it.349 The right applies only at trial; there
is no constitutional right to self-representation on direct appeal from
a criminal conviction.350
     The essential elements of self-representation were spelled out
in McKaskle v. Wiggins,351 a case involving the self-represented de-
fendant’s rights vis-a-vis “standby counsel” appointed by the trial
court. The “core of the Faretta right” is that the defendant “is en-
titled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present
to the jury,” and consequently, standby counsel’s participation “should
not be allowed to destroy the jury’s perception that the defendant
is representing himself.” 352 But participation of standby counsel even
in the jury’s presence and over the defendant’s objection does not
violate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights when serving the
basic purpose of aiding the defendant in complying with routine court-
room procedures and protocols and thereby relieving the trial judge
of these tasks.353

Right to Assistance of Counsel in Nontrial Situations
    Judicial Proceedings Before Trial.—Even a preliminary hear-
ing where no government prosecutor is present can trigger the right
to counsel.354 “[A] criminal defendant’s defendant’s initial appear-
ance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charges against
him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the start of ad-
versary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.” 355 “Attachment,” however, may sig-
nify “nothing more than the beginning of the defendant’s prosecu-
tion [and] . . . not mark the beginning of a substantive entitlement

546 U.S. 9 (2005) (per curiam). Related to the right of self-representation is the right
to testify in one’s own defense. Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44 (1987) (per se rule
excluding all hypnotically refreshed testimony violates right).
     349 The fact that a defendant is mentally competent to stand trial does not pre-

clude a court from finding him not mentally competent to represent himself at trial.
Indiana v. Edwards, 128 S. Ct. 2379 (2008). Mental competence to stand trial, how-
ever, is sufficient to ensure the right to waive the right to counsel in order to plead
guilty. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 398 (1993).
     350 Martinez v. Court of App. of Cal., Fourth App. Dist., 528 U.S. 152 (2000).

The Sixth Amendment itself “does not include any right to appeal.” 528 U.S. at 160.
     351 465 U.S. 168 (1984).
     352 465 U.S. at 178.
     353 465 U.S. at 184.
     354 Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 128 S. Ct. 2578 (2008) (right to appointed coun-

sel attaches even if no public prosecutor, as distinct from a police officer, is aware of
that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct).
     355 128 S. Ct. at 2592.
