federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 erred when it took
the issue of the “materiality” of the false statement away from the
jury.73 Later, however, the Court backed off from this latter ruling,
holding that failure to submit the issue of materiality to the jury
in a tax fraud case can constitute harmless error.74 Subsequently,
the Court held that, just as failing to prove materiality to the jury
beyond a reasonable doubt can be harmless error, so can failing to
prove a sentencing factor to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
“Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be rec-
onciled with our recognition in Apprendi that elements and sentenc-
ing factors must be treated the same for Sixth Amendment pur-
poses.” 75
    When the Jury Trial Guarantee Applies.—The Sixth Amend-
ment is phrased in terms of “all criminal prosecutions,” but the Court
has always excluded petty offenses from the guarantee to a jury
trial in federal courts, defining the line between petty and serious
offenses either by the maximum punishment available 76 or by the
nature of the offense.77 This line has been adhered to in the appli-
cation of the Sixth Amendment to the states,78 and the Court has
now held “that no offense can be deemed ‘petty’ for purposes of the
right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six months
is authorized.” 79 A defendant who is prosecuted in a single proceed-
ing for multiple petty offenses, however, does not have a constitu-

     75 Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S. 212, 220 (2006). Apprendi is discussed in

the next section.
     76 District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States,

195 U.S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540 (1888).
     77 District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U.S. 63 (1930).
     78 Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 159–62 (1968); Dyke v. Taylor Implement

Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216 (1968).
     79 Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 69 (1970). Justices Black and Douglas would

have required a jury trial in all criminal proceedings in which the sanction imposed
bears the indicia of criminal punishment. Id. at 74 (concurring); Cheff v. Schnackenberg,
384 U.S. 373, 384, 386 (1966) (dissenting). Chief Justice Burger and Justices Har-
lan and Stewart objected to setting this limitation at six months for the States, pre-
ferring to give them greater leeway. Baldwin, 399 U.S. at 76; Williams v. Florida,
399 U.S. 78, 117, 143 (1970) (dissenting). No jury trial was required when the trial
judge suspended sentence and placed defendant on probation for three years. Frank
v. United States, 395 U.S. 147 (1969). There is a presumption that offenses carrying
a maximum imprisonment of six months or less are “petty,” although it is possible
that such an offense could be pushed into the “serious” category if the legislature
tacks on onerous penalties not involving incarceration. No jury trial is required, how-
ever, when the maximum sentence is six months in jail, a fine not to exceed $1,000,
a 90-day driver’s license suspension, and attendance at an alcohol abuse education
course. Blanton v. City of North Las Vegas, 489 U.S. 538, 542–44 (1989).
