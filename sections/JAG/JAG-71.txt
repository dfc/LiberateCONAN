cal presence of the accused at a trial-like confrontation at which
the accused requires the guiding hand of counsel, the Sixth Amend-
ment does not guarantee the assistance of counsel.
    Because the defendant was not present when witnesses to the
crime viewed photographs of possible guilty parties, and therefore
there was no trial-like confrontation, and because the possibilities
of abuse in a photographic display are discoverable and reconstructable
at trial by examination of witnesses, an indicted defendant is not
entitled to have his counsel present at such a display.396
     Both Wade and Gilbert had already been indicted and counsel
had been appointed to represent them when their lineups were con-
ducted, a fact noted in the opinions and in subsequent ones,397 but
the cases in which the rulings were denied retroactive application
involved preindictment lineups.398 Nevertheless, in Kirby v. Illi-
nois,399 the Court held that no right to counsel exists with respect
to lineups that precede some formal act of charging a suspect. The
Sixth Amendment does not become operative, explained Justice Stew-
art’s plurality opinion, until “the initiation of adversary judicial crimi-
nal proceedings—whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hear-
ings, indictment, information, or arraignment. . . . The initiation of
judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism. It is the
starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice. For
it is only then that the government has committed itself to pros-
ecute, and only then that the adverse positions of Government and
defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself
faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and im-
mersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.
It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the ‘crimi-
nal prosecutions’ to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth
Amendment are applicable.” 400 The Court’s distinguishing of the un-
appointed psychiatrist to determine his competency to stand trial, after his indict-
ment, was a “critical” stage, and he was entitled to the assistance of counsel before
submitting to it. Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 469–71 (1981). Constructive notice
is insufficient to alert counsel to psychiatric examination to assess future dangerous-
ness of an indicted client. Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249 (1987) (also subjecting
Estelle v. Smith violations to harmless error analysis in capital cases).

argued that it had never previously been doubted that Wade and Gilbert applied in
preindictment lineup situations and that, in any event, the rationale of the rule was
no different whatever the formal status of the case. Id. at 691. Justice White, who
