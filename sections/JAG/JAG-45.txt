for face-to-face confrontation.” 249 This preference can be overcome
“only where denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an
important public policy and only where the reliability of the testi-
mony is otherwise assured.” 250 Relying on the traditional and “tran-
scendent” state interest in protecting the welfare of children, on the
significant number of state laws designed to protect child wit-
nesses, and on “the growing body of academic literature document-
ing the psychological trauma suffered by child abuse victims,” 251
the Court found a state interest sufficiently important to outweigh
a defendant’s right to face-to-face confrontation. Reliability of the
testimony was assured by the “rigorous adversarial testing [that]
preserves the essence of effective confrontation.” 252 All of this, of
course, would have led to a different result in Coy as well, but Coy
was distinguished with the caveat that “[t]he requisite finding of
necessity must of course be a case-specific one”; Maryland’s re-
quired finding that a child witness would suffer “serious emotional
distress” if not protected was clearly adequate for this purpose.253
    In another case involving child sex crime victims, the Court held
that there is no right of face-to-face confrontation at an in-
chambers hearing to determine the competency of a child victim to
testify, because the defendant’s attorney participated in the hear-
ing, and because the procedures allowed “full and effective” oppor-
tunity to cross-examine the witness at trial and request reconsid-
eration of the competency ruling.254 And there is no absolute right
to confront witnesses with relevant evidence impeaching those wit-
nesses; failure to comply with a rape shield law’s notice require-
ment can validly preclude introduction of evidence relating to a wit-
ness’s prior sexual history.255

                          COMPULSORY PROCESS
    The provision requires, of course, that the defendant be af-
forded legal process to compel witnesses to appear,256 but another
apparent purpose of the provision was to make inapplicable in fed-
    249  497 U.S. at 849 (emphasis in original).
    250  497 U.S. at 850. Dissenting Justice Scalia objected that face-to-face confron-
tation “is not a preference ‘reflected’ by the Confrontation Clause [but rather] a con-
stitutional right unqualifiedly guaranteed,” and that the Court “has applied ‘interest-
balancing’ analysis where the text of the Constitution simply does not permit it.” Id.
