    Against this background, a unanimous Court in Gideon v. Wain-
wright 282 overruled Betts v. Brady and held “that in our adversary
system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too
poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel
is provided for him.” 283 Justice Black, a dissenter in the 1942 deci-
sion, asserted for the Court that Betts was an “abrupt break” with
earlier precedents, citing Powell and Johnson v. Zerbst. Rejecting
the Betts reasoning, the Court decided that the right to assistance
of counsel is “fundamental” and the Fourteenth Amendment does
make the right constitutionally required in state courts.284 The Court’s
opinion in Gideon left unanswered the question whether the right
to assistance of counsel could be claimed by defendants charged with
misdemeanors or serious misdemeanors as well as with felonies, and
it was not until later that the Court held that the right applies to
any misdemeanor case in which imprisonment is imposed—that no
person may be sentenced to jail who was convicted in the absence
of counsel, unless he validly waived his right.285 The Court subse-
quently extended the right to cases where a suspended sentence or
probationary period is imposed, on the theory that any future incar-
ceration that occurred would be based on the original uncounseled
conviction.286
    Because the absence of counsel when a defendant is convicted
or pleads guilty goes to the fairness of the proceedings and under-
himself. The case seemed to require reversal of any conviction when the record con-
tained a prejudicial occurrence that under state law might have been prevented or
ameliorated. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506 (1962), reversed a conviction because
the unrepresented defendant failed to follow some advantageous procedure that a
lawyer might have utilized. Chewning v. Cunningham, 368 U.S. 443 (1962), found
that a lawyer might have developed several defenses and adopted several tactics to
defeat a charge under a state recidivist statute, and that therefore the unrepresented
defendant had been prejudiced.

     283 372 U.S. at 344.
     284 372 U.S. at 342–43, 344. Justice Black, of course, believed the Fourteenth

Amendment made applicable to the States all the provisions of the Bill of Rights,
Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 71 (1947), but for purposes of delivering the
opinion of the Court followed the due process absorption doctrine. Justice Douglas,
concurring, maintained the incorporation position. Gideon, 372 U.S. at 345. Justice
Harlan concurred, objecting both to the Court’s manner of overruling Betts v. Brady
and to the incorporation implications of the opinion. Id. at 349.
     285 Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979), adopted a rule of actual punishment

and thus modified Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972), which had held coun-
sel required if imprisonment were possible. The Court has also extended the right
of assistance of counsel to juvenile proceedings. In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967). See
