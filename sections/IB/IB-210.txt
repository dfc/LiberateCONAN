and trust companies was invalidated.1122 The Court plainly thought
the statute was protectionist, but instead of voiding it for that rea-
son it held that the legitimate interests the state might have did
not justify the burdens placed on out-of-state companies and that
the state could pursue the accomplishment of legitimate ends through
some intermediate form of regulation. In Edgar v. MITE Corp.,1123
an Illinois regulation of take-over attempts of companies that had
specified business contacts with the state, as applied to an at-
tempted take-over of a Delaware corporation with its principal place
of business in Connecticut, was found to constitute an undue bur-
den, with special emphasis upon the extraterritorial effect of the
law and the dangers of disuniformity. These problems were found
lacking in the next case, in which the state statute regulated the
manner in which purchasers of corporations chartered within the
state and with a specified percentage of in-state shareholders could
proceed with their take-over efforts. The Court emphasized that the
state was regulating only its own corporations, which it was empow-
ered to do, and no matter how many other states adopted such laws
there would be no conflict. The burdens on interstate commerce, and
the Court was not that clear that the effects of the law were bur-
densome in the appropriate context, were justified by the state’s in-
terests in regulating its corporations and resident shareholders.1124
    In other areas, although the Court repeats balancing language,
it has not applied it with any appreciable bite,1125 but in most re-
spects the state regulations involved are at most problematic in the
context of the concerns of the Commerce Clause.

Foreign Commerce and State Powers
    State taxation and regulation of commerce from abroad are also
subject to negative commerce clause constraints. In the seminal case
of Brown v. Maryland,1126 in the course of striking down a state
statute requiring “all importers of foreign articles or commodities,”
preparatory to selling the goods, to take out a license, Chief Jus-
tice Marshall developed a lengthy exegesis explaining why the law
