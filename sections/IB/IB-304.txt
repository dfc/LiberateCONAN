Delegation of Legislative Power in Wartime
     During wartime, Congress has been prone to delegate more pow-
ers to the President than at other times.1694 The Court, however,
has insisted that, “[i]n peace or war it is essential that the Consti-
tution be scrupulously obeyed, and particularly that as in times of
peace the respective branches of the government keep within the
power assigned to each by the Constitution. On the other hand, . . .
[i]n time of crisis nothing could be more tragic and less expressive
of the intent of the people than so to construe their Constitution
that by its own terms it would substantially hinder rather than help
them in defending its national safety.” 1695 Few cases, however, ac-
tually discuss when a wartime delegation of legislative power might
be excessive.1696 Two theories have been advanced at times when
the delegation doctrine carried more force than it has in recent years.
First, has been suggested that, because the war power is inherent
in the Federal Government, and one shared by the legislative and
executive branches, Congress does not really delegate legislative power
when it authorizes the President to exercise the war power in a
prescribed manner. But this view overlooks the fact that the Con-
stitution expressly vests the war power as a legislative power in
Congress. Second, it has been suggested that Congress’s power to
delegate in wartime is as limited as in other situations, but that
the existence of a state of war is a factor weighing in favor of the
validity of the delegation.
    The first theory was fully stated by Justice Bradley in Hamil-
ton v. Dillin,1697 upholding a levy imposed by the Secretary of the
Treasury pursuant to an act of Congress. To the argument that the
levy was a tax the fixing of which Congress could not delegate, Jus-
tice Bradley noted that the power exercised “does not belong to the

    1693  335 U.S. at 170.
    1694  For an extensive consideration of this subject in the context of the Presi-
dent’s redelegation of it, see N. GRUNDSTEIN, PRESIDENTIAL DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY IN
WARTIME (1961).
     1695 Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 779–80 (1948).
     1696 In the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 389 (1918), a “contention

that an act [was] void as a delegation of federal power to state officials” was dis-
missed as “too wanting in merit to require further notice.” Likewise, “the contention
that . . . vesting administrative officers with legislative discretion [is unconstitu-
tional] has been so completely adversely settled as to require reference only to some
of the decided cases.” Id. (citing three cases). A wartime delegation was upheld by
reference to peacetime precedents in Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 424 (1944).
     1697 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 73 (1875).
