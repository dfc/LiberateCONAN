       declared: “The constitutionality of this delegation of authority has
       never been seriously questioned.” 1981

                              PAYMENT OF CLAIMS
           No officer of the Federal Government is authorized to pay a debt
       due from the United States, whether reduced to judgment or not,
       without an appropriation for that purpose.1982 Nor may a govern-
       ment employee, by erroneous advice to a claimant, bind the United
       States through equitable estoppel principles to pay a claim for which
       an appropriation has not been made.1983
           After the Civil War, a number of controversies arose out of at-
       tempts by Congress to restrict the payment of the claims of per-
       sons who had aided the Rebellion but had thereafter received a par-
       don from the President. The Supreme Court held that Congress could
       not prescribe the evidentiary effect of a pardon in a proceeding in
       the Court of Claims for property confiscated during the Civil War,1984
       but that where the confiscated property had been sold and the pro-
       ceeds paid into the Treasury, a pardon did not of its own force au-
       thorize the restoration of such proceeds.1985 It was within the com-
       petence of Congress to declare that the amount due to persons thus
       pardoned should not be paid out of the Treasury and that no gen-
       eral appropriation should extend to their claims.1986

    Clause 8. No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United
States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust un-
der them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress accept of
any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever,
from any King, Prince, or foreign State.
                                 IN GENERAL
          In 1871 the Attorney General of the United States ruled that:
       “A minister of the United States abroad is not prohibited by the
       Constitution from rendering a friendly service to a foreign power,
       even that of negotiating a treaty for it, provided he does not be-
       come an officer of that power . . . but the acceptance of a formal
       commission, as minister plenipotentiary, creates an official relation
