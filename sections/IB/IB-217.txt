language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.” 1153
Because preemption cases, when the statute contains no express pro-
vision, theoretically turn on statutory construction, generalizations
about them can carry one only so far. Each case must construe a
different federal statute with a distinct legislative history. If the stat-
ute and the legislative history are silent or unclear, the Supreme
Court has developed general criteria which it purports to use in de-
termining the preemptive reach.
    “Absent explicit pre-emptive language, we have recognized at
least two types of implied pre-emption: field pre-emption, where the
scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable
the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supple-
ment it, . . . and conflict pre-emption, where compliance with both
federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility, . . . or where
state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-
tion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” 1154 However,
“federal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed pre-
emptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive rea-
sons—either that the nature of the regulated subject matters per-
mits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably
so ordained.” 1155 At the same time, “[t]he relative importance to the


sion of Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 regulating activi-
ties of motor carriers “with respect to transportation of property” held not to pre-
empt state laws on the disposal of towed vehicles by towing companies).

used throughout the preemption cases. E.g., Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505

Congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the States, courts should “start
with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be
superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of
Congress.” Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Dev.
Comm., 461 U.S. 190, 206 (1983) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S.
218, 230 (1947)). Nonetheless, this assumption may go only so far. See, e.g., Pliva,
Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S. ___, No. 09–993, slip op. at 15 (2011) (Thomas, J., plural-
