can exercise only the powers granted to it, would seem too appar-
ent, to have required to be enforced by all those arguments, which
its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people,
found it necessary to urge; that principle is now universally admit-
ted.” 34
     Early in the history of the Constitution, however, Hamilton as-
serted that the “executive power,” textually committed to the Presi-
dent, is not confined to those items expressly enumerated in Ar-
ticle II.35 A similarly broad conception of “the judicial power of the
United States,” as vested in the courts, is seen in Justice Brewer’s
opinion for the Court in Kansas v. Colorado.36 But, even the more
narrowly worded delegation to the Congress of “legislative powers
herein granted” is severely strained by Chief Justice Marshall’s broad
conception of some of these powers. In McCulloch v. Maryland, the
Chief Justice asserted that “[t]he sword and the purse, all the ex-
ternal relations, and no inconsiderable portion of the industry of
the nation, are intrusted to its government”; 37 he characterizes “the
power of making war, or levying taxes, or of regulating commerce”
as “great substantive and independent power[s]”; 38 and he declares
that the power conferred by the “necessary and proper” clause em-
braces all legislative “means which are appropriate” to carry out
the legitimate ends of the Constitution, unless inconsistent “with
the letter and spirit of the constitution.” 39
     Nine years later, Marshall introduced what Story in his Com-
mentaries labels the concept of “resulting powers,” which are those
that “result from the whole mass of the powers of the National Gov-
ernment, and from the nature of political society, [rather] than [as]
a consequence or incident of the powers specially enumerated.” 40
Story references Marshall’s opinion in American Ins. Co. v. Can-
ter,41 which states that “the constitution confers absolutely on the
government of the Union, the powers of making war, and of mak-
ing treaties; consequently, that government possesses the power of
acquiring territory, either by conquest or by treaty.” 42 And from the
