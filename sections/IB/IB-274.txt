exhibit originality, embody some creative expression; 1491 to merit
patent protection, an invention must be an innovative advance-
ment, “push back the frontiers.” 1492 Also deriving from the phrase
“promotion of science and the arts” is the issue of whether Con-
gress may only provide for grants of protection that broaden the
availability of new materials.1493
    Acting within these strictures, Congress has broad leeway to de-
termine how best to promote creativity and utility through tempo-
rary monopolies. “It is Congress that has been assigned the task of
defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted
to authors,” the Court has said.1494 “Satisfied” in Eldred v. Ashcroft
that the Copyright Term Extension Act did not violate the “limited
times” prescription, the Court saw the only remaining question to
be whether the enactment was “a rational exercise of the legisla-

     1491 Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991) (pub-

lisher of telephone directory, consisting of white pages and yellow pages, not en-
titled to copyright in white pages, which are only compilations). “To qualify for copy-
right protection, a work must be original to the author. . . . Originality, as the term
is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the
author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses some minimal
degree of creativity. . . . To be sure, the requisite level of creativity is extremely low;
even a slight amount will suffice.” Id. at 345. First clearly articulated in The Trade-
Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879), and Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111
U.S. 53, 58–60 (1884), the requirement is expressed in nearly every copyright opin-
ion, but its forceful iteration in Feist was noteworthy, because originality is a statu-
tory requirement as well, 17 U.S.C. § 102(a), and it was unnecessary to discuss the
concept in constitutional terms.
     1492 A. & P. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147 (1950). In a

concurring opinion, Justice Douglas wrote, for himself and Justice Black: “Every pat-
ent is the grant of a privilege of exacting tolls from the public. The Framers plainly
did not want those monopolies freely granted. . . . It is not enough that an article
is new and useful. The Constitution never sanctioned the patenting of gadgets. Pat-
ents serve a higher end—the advancement of science. An invention need not be as
startling as an atomic bomb to be patentable. But it has to be of such quality and
distinction that masters of the scientific field in which it falls will recognize it as an
advance.” 340 U.S. at 154–55 (Justice Douglas concurring).
     1493 Kendall v. Winsor, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 322, 328 (1859) (“[T]he inventor who

designedly, and with the view of applying it indefinitely and exclusively for his own
profit, withholds his invention from the public, comes not within the policy or ob-
jects of the Constitution or acts of Congress.”).
     In Golan v. Holder, publishers and musicians challenged a law that allowed for
copyright protection of certain foreign works theretofore in the public domain, in
conformance with international practice. Plaintiffs alleged the provision was invalid
because, inter alia, it failed to give incentives for creating new works. Though this
view found support in Justice Breyer’s dissent, the majority held the Copyright Clause
does not require that every provision of copyright law be designed to encourage new
works. Rather, Congress has broad discretion to determine the intellectual property
regime that, in its judgment, best serves the overall purposes of the Clause, includ-
ing broader dissemination of existing and future American works. 565 U.S. ___, No.
