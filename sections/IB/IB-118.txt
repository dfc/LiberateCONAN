ply with the federal conditions,643 more recently the Court has re-
quired that any such susceptibility to suit be clearly spelled out so
that states will be informed of potential consequences of accepting
aid. Finally, it should be noted that Congress has enacted a range
of laws forbidding discrimination in federal assistance programs,644
and some of these laws are enforceable against the states.645
    Earmarked Funds.—The appropriation of the proceeds of a tax
to a specific use does not affect the validity of the exaction, if the
general welfare is advanced and no other constitutional provision
is violated. Thus a processing tax on coconut oil was sustained de-
spite the fact that the tax collected upon oil of Philippine produc-
tion was segregated and paid into the Philippine Treasury.646 In Helver-
ing v. Davis,647 the excise tax on employers—the proceeds of which
were not earmarked in any way, although intended to provide funds
for payments to retired workers—was upheld under the “general
welfare” clause, the Tenth Amendment’s being found inapplicable.
    Debts of the United States.—The power to pay the debts of
the United States is broad enough to include claims of citizens aris-
ing on obligations of right and justice.648 The Court sustained an
act of Congress which set apart for the use of the Philippine Is-
lands, the revenue from a processing tax on coconut oil of Philip-
pine production, as being in pursuance of a moral obligation to pro-
tect and promote the welfare of the people of the Islands.649 Curiously
enough, this power was first invoked to assist the United States to
collect a debt due to it. In United States v. Fisher,650 the Supreme
Court sustained a statute that gave the Federal Government prior-
ity in the distribution of the estates of its insolvent debtors. The
debtor in that case was the endorser of a foreign bill of exchange
     643 E.g., King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968); Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397

(1970); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974); Miller v. Youakim, 440 U.S. 125 (1979).
Suits may be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, see Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1
(1980), although in some instances the statutory conferral of rights may be too im-
precise or vague for judicial enforcement. Compare Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347
(1992), with Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Auth., 479 U.S. 418 (1987).
     644 E.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; Title IX of

the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681; Title V of the Rehabilita-
tion Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.
     645 Here the principal constraint is the Eleventh Amendment. See, e.g., Board of

Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001) (Americans with Disabili-
ties Act of 1990 exceeds congressional power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment,
and violates the Eleventh Amendment, by subjecting states to suits brought by state
employees in federal courts to collect money damages).
