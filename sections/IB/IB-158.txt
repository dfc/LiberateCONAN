been sustained by the Court under Congress’s revenue powers and
under its power to regulate foreign commerce. For the Court in Board
of Trustees v. United States,845 in 1933, Chief Justice Hughes said:
“The Congress may determine what articles may be imported into
this country and the terms upon which importation is permitted.
No one can be said to have a vested right to carry on foreign com-
merce with the United States. . . . It is true that the taxing power
is a distinct power; that it is distinct from the power to regulate
commerce. . . . It is also true that the taxing power embraces the
power to lay duties. Art. I, § 8, par. 1. But because the taxing power
is a distinct power and embraces the power to lay duties, it does
not follow that duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the
power to regulate commerce. The contrary is well established. Gib-
bons v. Ogden, supra, p. 202. ‘Under the power to regulate foreign
commerce Congress impose duties on importations, give draw-
backs, pass embargo and non-intercourse laws, and make all other
regulations necessary to navigation, to the safety of passengers, and
the protection of property.’ Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505.
The laying of duties is ‘a common means of executing the power.’ 2

     Foreign Commerce: Banned Articles.—The forerunners of more
recent acts excluding objectionable commodities from interstate com-
merce are the laws forbidding the importation of like commodities
from abroad. Congress has exercised this power since 1842, when
it forbade the importation of obscene literature or pictures from
abroad.847 Six years, later it passed an act “to prevent the importa-
tion of spurious and adulterated drugs” and to provide a system of
inspection to make the prohibition effective.848 Such legislation guard-
ing against the importation of noxiously adulterated foods, drugs,
or liquor has been on the statute books ever since. In 1887, the im-
portation by Chinese nationals of opium was prohibited,849 and sub-
sequent statutes passed in 1909 and 1914 made it unlawful for any-
one to import it.850 In 1897, Congress forbade the importation of
any tea “inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption” as
compared with a legal standard.851 The Act was sustained in 1904,
in Buttfield v. Stranahan.852 In “The Abby Dodge” an act excluding
sponges taken by means of diving or diving apparatus from the wa-
