stituted a violation of the First Amendment and was void.336 In the
course of that decision, the Court denied state legislators the power
to look behind the willingness of any legislator to take the oath to
support the Constitution of the United States, prescribed by Article
VI, cl. 3, to test his sincerity in taking it.337 The unanimous Court
noted the views of Madison and Hamilton on the exclusivity of the
qualifications set out in the Constitution and alluded to Madison’s
view that the unfettered discretion of the legislative branch to ex-
clude members could be abused in behalf of political, religious or
other orthodoxies.338 The First Amendment holding and the hold-
ing with regard to testing the sincerity with which the oath of of-
fice is taken is no doubt as applicable to the United States Con-
gress as to state legislatures.
    State Additions.—However much Congress may have devi-
ated from the principle that the qualifications listed in the Consti-
tution are exclusive when the issue has been congressional enlarge-
ment of those qualifications, it has been uniform in rejecting efforts
by the states to enlarge the qualifications. Thus, the House in 1807
seated a Member-elect who was challenged as not being in compli-

ment in the district, rather than the federal requirement of being
an inhabitant of the state at the time of election; the state require-
ment, the House resolved, was unconstitutional.339 Similarly, both
the House and Senate have seated other Members-elect who did not
meet additional state qualifications or who suffered particular state
disqualifications on eligibility, such as running for Congress while
holding particular state offices.
    The Supreme Court reached the same conclusion as to state power,
albeit by a surprisingly close 5–4 vote, in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v.
Thornton.340 Arkansas, along with twenty-two other states, all but
two by citizen initiatives, had limited the number of terms that Mem-
bers of Congress may serve. In striking down the Arkansas term
limits, the Court determined that the Constitution’s qualifications
