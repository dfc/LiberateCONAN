        to the effect that the House had no power to expel for misconduct
        occurring prior to the Congress in which the expulsion is proposed,
        as was the case of Mr. Powell’s alleged misconduct. The Court based
        its rejection on its inability to conclude that, if the Members of the
        House had been voting to expel, they would still have cast an affir-
        mative vote in excess of two-thirds.418

        Duty To Keep a Journal
             The object of the clause requiring the keeping of a Journal is
        “to insure publicity to the proceedings of the legislature, and a cor-
        respondent responsibility of the members to their respective con-
        stituents.” 419 When the Journal of either House is put in evidence
        for the purpose of determining whether the yeas and nays were or-
        dered, and what the vote was on any particular question, the Jour-
        nal must be presumed to show the truth, and a statement therein
        that a quorum was present, though not disclosed by the yeas and
        nays, is final.420 But when an enrolled bill, which has been signed
        by the Speaker of the House and by the President of the Senate, in
        open session receives the approval of the President and is depos-
        ited in the Department of State, its authentication as a bill that
        has passed Congress is complete and unimpeachable, and it is not
        competent to show from the Journals of either House that an act
        so authenticated, approved, and deposited, in fact omitted one sec-
        tion actually passed by both Houses of Congress.421

    SECTION 6. Clause 1. The Senators and Representatives shall

be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Ses-

        that a state legislature has ratified a proposed amendment to the Constitution. Leser
