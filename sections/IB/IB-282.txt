State Power Affecting Patents and Copyrights
    Displacement of state police or taxing powers by federal patent
or copyright has been a source of considerable dispute. Ordinarily,
rights secured to inventors must be enjoyed in subordination to the
general authority of the states over all property within their limits.
A state statute requiring the condemnation of illuminating oils in-
flammable at less than 130 degrees Fahrenheit was held not to in-
terfere with any right secured by the patent laws, although the oil
for which the patent was issued could not be made to comply with
state specifications.1544 In the absence of federal legislation, a state
may prescribe reasonable regulations for the transfer of patent rights,
so as to protect its citizens from fraud. Hence, a requirement of state
law that the words “given for a patent right” appear on the face of
notes given in payment for such right is not unconstitutional.1545
Royalties received from patents or copyrights are subject to nondis-
criminatory state income taxes, a holding to the contrary being over-
ruled.1546
    State power to protect things not patented or copyrighted un-
der federal law has been buffeted under changing Court doctrinal
views. In two major cases, the Court held that a state could not
use unfair competition laws to prevent or punish the copying of prod-
ucts not entitled to a patent. Emphasizing the necessity for a uni-
form national policy and adverting to the monopolistic effects of the
state protection, the Court inferred that, because Congress had not
extended the patent laws to the material at issue, federal policy
was to promote free access when the materials were thus in the
public domain.1547 But, in Goldstein v. California,1548 the Court dis-
tinguished the two prior cases and held that the determination whether
a state “tape piracy” statute conflicted with the federal copyright
statute depended upon the existence of a specific congressional in-
tent to forbid state protection of the “writing” there involved. Its
consideration of the statute and of its legislative history convinced
the Court that Congress in protecting certain “writings” and in not

tudes with respect to the preclusion of the states from acting in fields covered by
the Copyright Clause, whether Congress had or had not acted. The latter case rec-
ognized permissible state interests, id. at 552–560, whereas the former intimated
that congressional power was exclusive. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S.
