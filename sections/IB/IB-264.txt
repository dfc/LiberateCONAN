    The power of Congress to vest the adjudication of bankruptcy
claims in entities not having the constitutional status of Article III
federal courts is unsettled. At least, it may not give to non-Article
III courts the authority to hear state law claims made subject to
federal jurisdiction only because of their relevance to a bankruptcy
proceeding.1423

Constitutional Status of State Insolvency Laws: Preemption
     Prior to 1898, Congress exercised the power to establish “uni-
form laws on the subject of bankruptcy” only intermittently. The
first national bankruptcy law was not enacted until 1800 and was
repealed in 1803; the second was passed in 1841 and was repealed
two years later; a third was enacted in 1867 and repealed in 1878.1424
Thus, during the first eighty-nine years under the Constitution, a
national bankruptcy law was in existence only sixteen years alto-
gether. Consequently, the most important issue of interpretation that
arose during that period concerned the effect of the clause on state
law.
    The Supreme Court ruled at an early date that, in the absence
of congressional action, the states may enact insolvency laws, be-
cause it is not the mere existence of the power but rather its exer-
cise that is incompatible with the exercise of the same power by
the states.1425 Later cases settled further that the enactment of a
national bankruptcy law does not invalidate state laws in conflict
therewith but serves only to relegate them to a state of suspended
animation with the result that upon repeal of the national statute
they again come into operation without re-enactment.1426
    A state, of course, has no power to enforce any law governing
bankruptcies that impairs the obligation of contracts,1427 extends
to persons or property outside its jurisdiction,1428 or conflicts with
the national bankruptcy laws.1429 Giving effect to the policy of the
federal statute, the Court has held that a state statute regulating
this distribution of property of an insolvent was suspended by that
