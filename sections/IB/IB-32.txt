sible, the constitutional requirements of delegation have been ful-
filled.136 This requirement may be met through the provisions of
the Administrative Procedure Act,137 but where that Act is inappli-
cable or where the Court sees the necessity for exceeding its provi-
sions, due process can supply the safeguards of required hearing,
notice, supporting statements, and the like.138
     Conflict Between State or Federal Statutes and Delegated
Authority.— A rule or regulation properly promulgated under au-
thority received from Congress is law, and under the supremacy
clause of the Constitution can preempt state law.139 Further, in ex-
ercising a delegated power, the President or another officer may ef-
fectively suspend or rescind a law passed by Congress. Early cases
sustained contingency legislation giving the President power, upon
the finding of certain facts, to revive or suspend a law,140 and the
President’s power to raise or lower tariff rates equipped him to al-
ter statutory law.141 The Court in Opp Cotton Mills v. Administra-
tor 142 upheld Congress’s decision to delegate to the Wage and Hour
Administrator of the Labor Department the authority to establish
a minimum wage in particular industries greater than the statu-
tory minimum but no higher than a prescribed figure. Congress has
not often expressly addressed the issue of repeals or supersessions,
but in authorizing the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of civil



    136 Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426; Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline

Co., 490 U.S. 212, 218 (1989); American Light & Power Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90,
107, 108 (1946); Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, 312 U.S. 126, 144 (1941). It should
be remembered that the Court has renounced strict review of economic regulation
wholly through legislative enactment, forsaking substantive due process, so that re-
view of the exercise of delegated power by the same relaxed standard forwards a
consistent policy. E.g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726 (1963); Williamson v. Lee
Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955).
    137 Act of June 11, 1946, 60 Stat. 237, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551–559. In NLRB v. Wyman-

Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759 (1969), six Justices agreed that a Board proceeding had
been in fact rule-making and not adjudication and that the APA should have been
complied with. The Board won the particular case, however, because of a coales-
cence of divergent views of the Justices, but the Board has since reversed a policy
of not resorting to formal rule-making.
    138 E.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400

U.S. 433 (1971).
    139 City of New York v. FCC, 486 U.S. 57, 63–64 (1988); Louisiana PSC v. FCC,

458 U.S. 141, 153–54 (1982).
    140 E.g., The Brig Aurora, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 382 (1813).
    141 E.g., J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928); Field v.

Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892).
