point of disagreement was over which department of the govern-
ment had authority to say with finality what regions lie within the
theater of military operations. The majority claimed this function
for the courts and asserted that an area in which the civil courts
were open and functioning, and in which there were no hostilities,
does not qualify.1706 The minority argued that the question was for
Congress’s determination.1707 The entire Court rejected the Govern-
ment’s contention that the President’s determination was conclu-
sive in the absence of restraining legislation.1708
     Similarly, in Duncan v. Kahanamoku,1709 the Court declared that
the authority granted by Congress to the territorial governor of Ha-
waii to declare martial law under certain circumstances, which he
exercised in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, did not
warrant the supplanting of civil courts with military tribunals and
the trial of civilians for civilian crimes in these military tribunals
at a time when no obstacle stood in the way of the operation of the
civil courts, except, of course, the governor’s order.
    Enemy Country.—It has seemed reasonably clear that the Con-
stitution does not follow the advancing troops into conquered terri-
tory. Persons in such territory have been held entirely beyond the
reach of constitutional limitations and subject to the laws of war
as interpreted and applied by the Congress and the President.1710
“What is the law which governs an army invading an enemy’s coun-
try?” the Court asked in Dow v. Johnson.1711 “It is not the civil law
of the invaded country; it is not the civil law of the conquering coun-
try; it is military law—the law of war—and its supremacy for the
protection of the officers and soldiers of the army, when in service
in the field in the enemy’s country, is as essential to the efficiency
of the army as the supremacy of the civil law at home, and, in time
of peace, is essential to the preservation of liberty.”
    These conclusions follow not only from the usual necessities of
war but also from the Court’s doctrine that the Constitution is not
automatically applicable in all territories acquired by the United
States. The question turns upon whether Congress has made the
area “incorporated” or “unincorporated” territory.1712 In Reid v. Co-
