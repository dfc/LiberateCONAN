Bills of Credit
     Within the sense of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a pa-
per medium of exchange, intended to circulate between individu-
als, and between the government and individuals, for the ordinary
purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal
tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates, in
denominations not exceeding ten dollars, that were issued by loan
offices established by the state of Missouri and made receivable in
payment of taxes or other moneys due to the state, and in payment
of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit
whose issuance was banned by this section.1993 The states are not
forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes,1994 nor to
execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future
day for services rendered or money borrowed.1995 Bills issued by state
banks are not bills of credit; 1996 it is immaterial that the state is
the sole stockholder of the bank,1997 that the officers of the bank
were elected by the state legislature,1998 or that the capital of the
bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.1999

Legal Tender 2000
    Relying on this clause, which applies only to the states and not
to the Federal Government, the Supreme Court has held that, where
the marshal of a state court received state bank notes in payment
and discharge of an execution, the creditor was entitled to demand
payment in gold or silver.2001 Because, however, there is nothing in
the Constitution prohibiting a bank depositor from consenting when
he draws a check that payment may be made by draft, a state law
