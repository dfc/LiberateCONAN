     The modern doctrine may be traced to the 1928 case, J. W.
Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, in which the Court, speaking
through Chief Justice Taft, upheld Congress’s delegation to the Presi-
dent of the authority to set tariff rates that would equalize produc-
tion costs in the United States and competing countries.57 Al-
though formally invoking the theory that Congress had merely
established a contingency upon which the law became effective,58
the Court’s opinion also looked forward, emphasizing that in seek-
ing the cooperation of another branch Congress was restrained only
according to “common sense and the inherent necessities” of the situ-
ation.59 This vague statement was elaborated somewhat in the state-
ment that the Court would sustain delegations whenever Congress
provided an “intelligible principle” to which the President or an agency
must conform.60
     In 1935, the Court struck down what it characterized as broad
and unprecedented delegations in Panama Refining v. Ryan 61 and
A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States.62 Both cases in-
volved provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act. At issue
in Panama Refining was a delegation to the President of authority
to prohibit interstate transportation of what was known as “hot oil”—
oil produced in excess of quotas set by state law. The problem was
that the Act provided no guidance to the President in determining
whether or when to exercise this authority, and required no finding
by the President as a condition of exercise of the authority. Con-
gress “declared no policy, . . . established no standard, [and] laid
down no rule,” but rather “left the matter to the President without
standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.” 63
     At issue in Schechter was a delegation to the President of au-
thority to promulgate codes of fair competition that could be drawn
up by industry groups or prescribed by the President on his own
initiative. The codes were required to implement the policies of the
Act, but those policies were so general as to be nothing more than
    57  276 U.S. 394 (1928).
    58  The Court noted it had upheld a similar law in Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649
(1892) because the President “was the mere agent of the lawmaking department to
ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to take effect”.
276 U.S. at 410–411.
     59 276 U.S. at 406.
     60 276 U.S. at 409. The “intelligible principle” test of Hampton is the same as

the “legislative standards” test found in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
States, 295 U.S. 495, 530 (1935), and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388,
421 (1935).
     61 293 U.S. 388 (1935).
     62 295 U.S. 495 (1935).
     63 293 U.S. at 430, 418, respectively. Similarly, the executive order exercising

the authority contained no finding or other explanation by which the legality of the
action could be tested. Id. at 431–33.
