“The organization of the Senate continued and was intact. The Sec-
retary of the Senate was functioning and was able to receive, and
did receive the bill.” 500 Such a procedure complied with the consti-
tutional provisions. “The Constitution does not define what shall con-
stitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in
effecting the return.” 501 The concerns activating the Court in The
Pocket Veto Case were not present. There was no indefinite period
in which a bill was in a state of suspended animation with public
uncertainty over the outcome. “When there is nothing but such a
temporary recess the organization of the House and its appropriate
officers continue to function without interruption, the bill is prop-
erly safeguarded for a very limited time and is promptly reported
and may be reconsidered immediately after the short recess is over.” 502
    The tension between the two cases, even though at a certain
level of generality they are consistent because of factual differ-
ences, has existed without the Supreme Court yet having occasion
to review the issue again. But, in Kennedy v. Sampson,503 an appel-
late court held that a return is not prevented by an intra-session
adjournment of any length by one or both Houses of Congress, so
long as the originating House arranged for receipt of veto mes-
sages. The court stressed that the absence of the evils deemed to
bottom the Court’s premises in The Pocket Veto Case—long delay
and public uncertainty—made possible the result.
    The two-thirds vote of each House required to pass a bill over
a veto means two-thirds of a quorum.504 After a bill becomes law,
of course, the President has no authority to repeal it. Asserting this
truism, the Court in The Confiscation Cases 505 held that the immu-
    500 302 U.S. at 589–90.
    501 302 U.S. at 589.
    502 302 U.S. at 595.
    503 511 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The Administration declined to appeal the case

to the Supreme Court. The adjournment here was for five days. Subsequently, the
President attempted to pocket veto two other bills, one during a 32-day recess and
one during the period in which Congress had adjourned sine die from the first to
the second session of the 93d Congress. After renewed litigation, the Administration
entered its consent to a judgment that both bills had become law, Kennedy v. Jones,
412 F. Supp. 353 (D.D.C., decree entered April 13, 1976), and it was announced that
President Ford “will use the return veto rather than the pocket veto during intra-
session and intersession recesses and adjournments of the Congress”, provided that
the House to which the bill must be returned has authorized an officer to receive
vetoes during the period it is not in session. President Reagan repudiated this agree-
ment and vetoed a bill during an intersession adjournment. Although the lower court
applied Kennedy v. Sampson to strike down the exercise of the power, but the case
was mooted prior to Supreme Court review. Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21 (D.C. Cir.
1985), vacated and remanded to dismiss sub nom. Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361
(1987).
    504 Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Kansas, 248 U.S. 276 (1919).
    505 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 92 (1874).
