another and held that this power applied to the transportation even
though the oil or gas was the property of the lines.768 Subse-
quently, the Court struck down state regulation of rates of electric
current generated within that state and sold to a distributor in an-
other State as a burden on interstate commerce.769 Proceeding on
the assumption that the ruling meant the Federal Government had
the power, Congress in the Federal Power Act of 1935 conferred on
the Federal Power Commission authority to regulate the wholesale
distribution of electricity in interstate commerce 770 and three years
later vested the FPC with like authority over natural gas moving
in interstate commerce.771 Thereafter, the Court sustained the power
of the Commission to set the prices at which gas originating in one
state and transported into another should be sold to distributors
wholesale in the latter state.772 “The sale of natural gas originat-
ing in the State and its transportation and delivery to distributors
in any other State constitutes interstate commerce, which is sub-
ject to regulation by Congress . . . . The authority of Congress to
regulate the prices of commodities in interstate commerce is at least
as great under the Fifth Amendment as is that of the States under
the Fourteenth to regulate the prices of commodities in intrastate
commerce.” 773
    Other acts regulating commerce and communication originat-
ing in this period have evoked no basic constitutional challenge. These
include the Federal Communications Act of 1934, providing for the
regulation of interstate and foreign communication by wire and ra-

sell the gas in other states is subject to FPC jurisdiction. See also California v. Lo-
