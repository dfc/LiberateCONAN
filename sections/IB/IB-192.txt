erations, in pursuit of these interests.1033 Here, too, safety concerns
became overriding objects of deference, even in doubtful cases.1034
In regard to navigation, which had given rise to Gibbons v. Ogden
and Cooley, the Court generally upheld much state regulation on
the basis that the activities were local and did not demand uni-
form rules.1035
    As a general rule, although the Court during this time did not
permit states to regulate a purely interstate activity or prescribe
prices for purely interstate transactions,1036 it did sustain a great
deal of price and other regulation imposed prior to or subsequent
to the travel in interstate commerce of goods produced for such com-
merce or received from such commerce. For example, decisions late
in the period upheld state price-fixing schemes applied to goods in-
tended for interstate commerce.1037
    However, the states always had an obligation to act nondiscriminatorily.
Just as in the taxing area, regulation that was parochially ori-
ented, to protect local producers or industries, for instance, was not
evaluated under ordinary standards but subjected to practically per
se invalidation. The mirror image of Welton v. Missouri,1038 the tax
case, was Minnesota v. Barber,1039 in which the Court invalidated a
facially neutral law that in its practical effect discriminated against
interstate commerce and in favor of local commerce. The law re-
quired fresh meat sold in the state to have been inspected by its

     1033 E.g., Bradley v. Public Utility Comm’n, 289 U.S. 92 (1933) (state could deny

an interstate firm a necessary certificate of convenience to operate as a common car-
rier on the basis that the route was overcrowded); Welch Co. v. New Hampshire,
306 U.S. 79 (1939) (maximum hours for drivers of motor vehicles); Eichholz v. Pub-
lic Service Comm’n, 306 U.S. 268 (1939) (reasonable regulations of traffic). But com-
pare Michigan Comm’n v. Duke, 266 U.S. 570 (1925) (state may not impose common-
carrier responsibilities on business operating between states that did not assume
them); Buck v. Kuykendall, 267 U.S. 307 (1925) (denial of certificate of convenience
under circumstances was a ban on competition).
     1034 E.g., Mauer v. Hamilton, 309 U.S. 598 (1940) (ban on operation of any mo-

tor vehicle carrying any other vehicle above the head of the operator). By far, the
example of the greatest deference is South Carolina Highway. Dep’t v. Barnwell Bros.,
303 U.S. 177 (1938), in which the Court upheld, in a surprising Stone opinion, truck
weight and width restrictions prescribed by practically no other state (in terms of
the width, no other).
     1035 E.g., Transportation Co. v. City of Chicago, 99 U.S. 635 (1879); Willamette

Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, 125 U.S. 1 (1888). See Kelly v. Washington, 302 U.S. 1
(1937) (upholding state inspection and regulation of tugs operating in navigable wa-
ters, in absence of federal law).

ers Grain Co., 258 U.S. 50 (1922); State Comm’n v. Wichita Gas Co., 290 U.S. 561
