involved was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935,816 which de-
clared the right of workers to organize, forbade unlawful employer
interference with this right, established procedures by which work-
ers could choose exclusive bargaining representatives with which
employers were required to bargain, and created a board to over-
see all these processes.817
     The Court, speaking through Chief Justice Hughes, upheld the
Act and found the corporation to be subject to the Act. “The close
and intimate effect,” he said, “which brings the subject within the
reach of federal power may be due to activities in relation to pro-
ductive industry although the industry when separately viewed is
local.” Nor will it do to say that such effect is “indirect.” Consider-
ing defendant’s “far-flung activities,” the effect of strife between it
and its employees “would be immediate and [it] might be cata-
strophic. We are asked to shut our eyes to the plainest facts of our
national life and to deal with the question of direct and indirect
effects in an intellectual vacuum. . . . When industries organize them-
for each Justice on the Court who was more than 70 years old, in the name of “judi-
cial efficiency.” The plan was defeated in the Senate, in part, perhaps, because in
such cases as Jones & Laughlin a Court majority began to demonstrate sufficient
“judicial efficiency.” See Leuchtenberg, The Origins of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ‘Court-
Packing’ Plan, 1966 SUP. CT. REV. 347 (P. Kurland ed.); Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone

     817 The NLRA was enacted against the backdrop of depression, although obvi-

ously it went far beyond being a mere antidepression measure, and Congress could
find precedent in railway labor legislation. In 1898, Congress passed the Erdman
Act, 30 Stat. 424, which attempted to influence the unionization of railroad workers
and facilitate negotiations with employers through mediation. The statute fell largely
into disuse because the railroads refused to mediate. Additionally, in Adair v. United
States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908), the Court struck down a section of the law outlawing
“yellow-dog contracts,” by which employers exacted promises of workers to quit or
not to join unions as a condition of employment. The Court held the section not to
be a regulation of commerce, there being no connection between an employee’s mem-
bership in a union and the carrying on of interstate commerce. Cf. Coppage v. Kan-
sas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915).
     In Wilson v. New, 243 U.S. 332 (1917), the Court did uphold a congressional
settlement of a threatened rail strike through the enactment of an eight-hour day
and a time-and-a-half for overtime for all interstate railway employees. The na-
tional emergency confronting the Nation was cited by the Court, but with the impli-
cation that the power existed in more normal times, suggesting that Congress’s pow-
ers were not as limited as some judicial decisions had indicated.
     Congress’s enactment of the Railway Labor Act in 1926, 44 Stat. 577, as amended,
45 U.S.C. §§ 151 et seq., was sustained by a Court decision admitting the connection
between interstate commerce and union membership as a substantial one. Texas &
N.L.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, 281 U.S. 548 (1930). A subsequent de-
cision sustained the application of the Act to “back shop” employees of an interstate
carrier who engaged in making heavy repairs on locomotives and cars withdrawn
from service for long periods, the Court finding that the activities of these employ-
ees were related to interstate commerce. Virginian Ry. v. System Federation No. 40,
300 U.S. 515 (1937).
