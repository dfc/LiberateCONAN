and detailed course of conduct and imposed an exaction on those
who transgress its standard. The Court did note that the law did
not bear characteristics of a regulatory penalty, as the cost of the
tax was far outweighed by the cost of obtaining health insurance,
making the payment of the tax a reasonable financial decision.590
Still, the majority’s discussion suggests that, for constitutional pur-
poses, the prominence of regulatory motivations for tax provisions
may become less important than the nature of the exactions im-
posed and the manner in which they are administered.
     In those areas where activities are subject to both taxation and
regulation, the taxing authority is not limited from reaching activi-
ties otherwise prohibited. For instance, Congress may tax an activ-
ity, such as the business of accepting wagers,591 regardless of whether
it is permitted or prohibited by the laws of the United States 592 or
by those of a state.593 However, Congress’s authority to regulate us-
ing the taxing power “reaches only existing subjects.” 594 Thus, so-
called federal “licenses,” so far as they relate to topics outside Con-
gress’s constitutional authority, merely express, “the purpose of the
government not to interfere . . . with the trade nominally licensed,
if the required taxes are paid.” In those instance, whether the “li-
censed” trade shall be permitted at all is a question that remains a
decision by the state.595

Promotion of Business: Protective Tariff
    The earliest examples of taxes levied with a view to promoting
desired economic objectives in addition to raising revenue were, of
course, import duties. The second statute adopted by the first Con-
gress was a tariff act reciting that “it is necessary for the support
of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States,
and the encouragement and protection of manufactures, that du-
ties be laid on goods, wares and merchandise imported.” 596 After
being debated for nearly a century and a half, the constitutionality
of protective tariffs was finally settled by the Supreme Court’s unani-
mous decision in J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, which
rejected a contention “that the only power of Congress in the levy-

furter maintained that this was not a bona fide tax, but was essentially an effort to
check, if not stamp out, professional gambling, an activity left to the responsibility
of the States. Justices Jackson and Douglas noted partial agreement with this con-
clusion. See also Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419 (1955).
