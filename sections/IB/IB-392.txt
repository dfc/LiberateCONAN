Tennessee,2250 decided more than a half century later, the Court shifted
position, holding that the unqualified prohibition of compacts and
agreements between states without the consent of Congress did not
apply to agreements concerning such minor matters as adjust-
ments of boundaries, which have no tendency to increase the politi-
cal powers of the contracting states or to encroach upon the just
supremacy of the United States. Adhering to this later understand-
ing of the clause, the Court found no enhancement of state power
in relation to the Federal Government through entry into the
Multistate Tax Compact, and thus sustained the agreement among
participating states without congressional consent.2251

Subject Matter of Interstate Compacts
    For many years after the Constitution was adopted, boundary
disputes continued to predominate as the subject matter of agree-
ments among the states. Since the turn of the twentieth century,
however, the interstate compact has been used to an increasing ex-
tent as an instrument for state cooperation in carrying out affirma-
tive programs for solving common problems.2252 The execution of
vast public undertakings, such as the development of the Port of
New York by the Port Authority created by compact between New
York and New Jersey, flood control, the prevention of pollution, and
the conservation and allocation of water supplied by interstate streams,
are among the objectives accomplished by this means. Another im-
portant use of this device was recognized by Congress in the act of
June 6, 1934,2253 whereby it consented in advance to agreements
for the control of crime. The first response to this stimulus was the
Crime Compact of 1934, providing for the supervision of parolees
and probationers, to which most of the states have given adher-
ence.2254 Subsequently, Congress has authorized, on varying condi-
tions, compacts touching the production of tobacco, the conserva-
tion of natural gas, the regulation of fishing in inland waters, the
furtherance of flood and pollution control, and other matters. More-
over, many states have set up permanent commissions for inter-
state cooperation, which have led to the formation of a Council of
State Governments, the creation of special commissions for the study
