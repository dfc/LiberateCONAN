ments was ever successful,365 and Congress deleted the standards
from the 1929 apportionment act.366
    In 1866, Congress was more successful in legislating to remedy
a situation under which deadlocks in state legislatures over the elec-
tion of Senators were creating vacancies in the office. The act re-
quired the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session
on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator
was selected.367
    The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections
was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the Fifteenth Amend-
ment’s guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage
rights.368 Under the Enforcement Act of 1870, and subsequent laws,
false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false
returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of
election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required of
him by state or federal law were made federal offenses.369 Provi-
sion was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to
attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to
challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to wit-
ness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the
added. These provisions were repeated in the next Act, 37 Stat. 13 (1911), there was
no apportionment following the 1920 Census, and the permanent 1929 Act omitted
the requirements. 46 Stat. 13. Cf. Wood v. Broom, 287 U.S. 1 (1932).
     365 The first challenge was made in 1843. The committee appointed to inquire

into the matter divided, the majority resolving that Congress had no power to bind
the States in regard to their manner of districting, the minority contending to the
contrary. H. REP. NO. 60, 28th Congress, 1st sess. (1843). The basis of the majority
view was that while Article I, § 4 might give Congress the power to create the dis-
tricts itself, the clause did not authorize Congress to tell the state legislatures how
to do it if the legislatures were left the task of drawing the lines. L. SCHMECKEBIER,
CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT 135–138 (1941). This argument would not appear to be
maintainable in light of the language in Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 383–86 (1880).
     366 46 Stat. 13 (1929). In 1967, Congress restored the single-member district re-

quirement. 81 Stat. 581, 2 U.S.C. § 2c.
     367 14 Stat. 243 (1866). Still another such regulation was the congressional speci-

fication of a common day for the election of Representatives in all the states. 17
Stat. 28 (1872), 2 U.S.C. § 7.
     368 Article I, § 4, and the Fifteenth Amendment have had quite different appli-

cations. The Court insisted that under the latter, while Congress could legislate to
protect the suffrage in all elections, it could do so only against state interference
based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, James v. Bowman, 190 U.S.
127 (1903); United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214 (1876), whereas under the former it
could also legislate against private interference for whatever motive, but only in fed-
eral elections. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S.
651 (1884).
     369 The Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 140; The Force Act of Febru-

ary 28, 1871, 16 Stat. 433; The Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13. The
text of these and other laws and the history of the enactments and subsequent de-
velopments are set out in R. CARR, FEDERAL PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS: QUEST FOR A
SWORD (1947).
