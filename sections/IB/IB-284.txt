       Trade-Marks and Advertisements
           In the famous Trade-Mark Cases,1556 decided in 1879, the Su-
       preme Court held void acts of Congress that, in apparent reliance
       upon this clause, extended the protection of the law to trademarks
       registered in the Patent Office. “The ordinary trade mark,” Justice
       Miller wrote for the Court, “has no necessary relation to invention
       or discovery”; nor is it to be classified “under the head of writings
       of authors.” It does not “depend upon novelty, invention, discovery,
       or any work of the brain.” 1557 Not many years later, the Court, again
       speaking through Justice Miller, ruled that a photograph may be
       constitutionally copyrighted,1558 and still later the Court held a cir-
       cus poster to be entitled to the same protection. In answer to the
       objection of the circuit court that a lithograph that “has no other
       use than that of a mere advertisement” would not be within the
       meaning of the Constitution, Justice Holmes summoned forth the
       shades of Velasquez, Whistler, Rembrandt, Ruskin, Degas, and oth-
       ers in support of the proposition that it is not for the courts to at-
       tempt to judge the worth of pictorial illustrations outside the nar-
       rowest and most obvious limits.1559

       Origin of the Clause
           “When the United States ceased to be a part of the British em-
       pire, and assumed the character of an independent nation, they be-
       came subject to that system of rules which reason, morality, and
       custom had established among civilized nations of Europe, as their
