Guidelines are advisory only, an increase in the applicable sentenc-
ing range is ex post facto if applied to a previously committed crime
because of a significant risk of a lengthier sentence being im-
posed.2029 But laws providing heavier penalties for new crimes there-
after committed by habitual criminals; 2030 “prescrib[ing] electrocu-
tion as the method of producing death instead of hanging, fix[ing]
the place therefor within the penitentiary, and permitt[ing] the pres-
ence of more invited witnesses that had theretofore been al-
lowed”; 2031 or providing for close confinement of six to nine months
in the penitentiary, in lieu of three to six months in jail prior to
execution, and substituting the warden for the sheriff as hangman,
have been sustained.2032
    In Dobbert v. Florida,2033 the Court may have formulated a new
test for determining when the punishment provided by a criminal
statute is ex post facto. The defendant murdered two of his chil-
dren at a time when Florida law provided the death penalty upon
conviction for certain takings of life. Subsequently, the Supreme Court
held capital sentencing laws similar to Florida’s unconstitutional,
although convictions obtained under the statutes were not to be over-
turned,2034 and the Florida Supreme Court voided its death pen-
alty statutes on the authority of the High Court decision. The Florida
legislature then enacted a new capital punishment law, which was
sustained. Dobbert was convicted and sentenced to death under the
new law, which had been enacted after the commission of his of-
fenses. The Court rejected the ex post facto challenge to the sen-
tence on the basis that whether or not the old statute was constitu-
tional, “it clearly indicated Florida’s view of the severity of murder
and of the degree of punishment which the legislature wished to
impose upon murderers. The statute was intended to provide maxi-
mum deterrence, and its existence on the statute books provided
fair warning as to the degree of culpability which the State as-

of covered offenders. Henceforth, “the focus of ex post facto inquiry is . . . whether
any such change alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty
by which a crime is punishable.” Id. at 506 n.3. Accord, Garner v. Jones, 529 U.S.
244 (2000) (evidence insufficient to determine whether change in frequency of pa-
role hearings significantly increases the likelihood of prolonging incarceration). But
see Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433 (1997) (cancellation of release credits already earned
and used, resulting in reincarceration, violates the Clause).
