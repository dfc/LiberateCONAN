the Act as “necessary and proper” for the enforcement of the Com-
merce Clause and also sustained the Commission’s power to go to
court to secure compliance with its orders. Later decisions circum-
scribed somewhat the ICC’s power.748
     Expansion of the Commission’s authority came in the Hepburn
Act of 1906 749 and the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910.750 By the former,
the Commission was explicitly empowered, after a full hearing on
a complaint, “to determine and prescribe just and reasonable” maxi-
mum rates; by the latter, it was authorized to set rates on its own
initiative and empowered to suspend any increase in rates by a car-
rier until it reviewed the change. At the same time, the Commis-
sion’s jurisdiction was extended to telegraphs, telephones, and cables.751
By the Motor Carrier Act of 1935,752 the ICC was authorized to regu-
late the transportation of persons and property by motor vehicle
common carriers.
     The modern powers of the Commission were largely defined by
the Transportation Acts of 1920 753 and 1940.754 The jurisdiction of
the Commission covers not only the characteristics of the rail, mo-
tor, and water carriers in commerce among the states but also the
issuance of securities by them and all consolidations of existing com-
panies or lines.755 Further, the Commission was charged with regu-
lating so as to foster and promote the meeting of the transporta-
tion needs of the country. Thus, from a regulatory exercise originally
begun as a method of restraint there has emerged a policy of en-
couraging a consistent national transportation policy.756

     751 These regulatory powers are now vested, of course, in the Federal Communi-

cations Commission.

     753 41 Stat. 474.
     754 54 Stat. 898, U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. The two acts were “intended . . . to provide

a completely integrated interstate regulatory system over motor, railroad, and wa-
ter carriers.” United States v. Pennsylvania R.R., 323 U.S. 612, 618–19 (1945). The
ICC’s powers include authority to determine the reasonableness of a joint through
international rate covering transportation in the United States and abroad and to
order the domestic carriers to pay reparations in the amount by which the rate is
unreasonable. Canada Packers v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry., 385 U.S. 182 (1966), and
cases cited.
     755 Disputes between the ICC and other government agencies over mergers have

occupied a good deal of the Court’s time. Cf. United States v. ICC, 396 U.S. 491
(1970). See also County of Marin v. United States, 356 U.S. 412 (1958); McLean Truck-
ing Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67 (1944); Penn-Central Merger & N & W Inclu-
sion Cases, 389 U.S. 486 (1968).
     756 Among the various provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act which have

been upheld are: a section penalizing shippers for obtaining transportation at less
than published rates, Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U.S. 56 (1908); a
