ing to tonnage,2233 for services rendered to the vessel, such as pilot-
age, towage, charges for loading and unloading cargoes, wharfage,
or storage.2234
    For the purpose of determining wharfage charges, it is immate-
rial whether the wharf was built by the state, a municipal corpora-
tion, or an individual. Where the wharf was owned by a city, the
fact that the city realized a profit beyond the amount expended did
not render the toll objectionable.2235 The services of harbor masters
for which fees are allowed must be actually rendered, and a law
permitting harbor masters or port wardens to impose a fee in all
cases is void.2236 A state may not levy a tonnage duty to defray the
expenses of its quarantine system,2237 but it may exact a fixed fee
for examination of all vessels passing quarantine.2238 A state li-
cense fee for ferrying on a navigable river is not a tonnage tax but
rather is a proper exercise of the police power and the fact that a
vessel is enrolled under federal law does not exempt it.2239 In the
State Tonnage Tax Cases,2240 an annual tax on steamboats mea-
sured by their registered tonnage was held invalid despite the con-
tention that it was a valid tax on the steamboat as property.
                          KEEPING TROOPS
     This provision contemplates the use of the stateâ€™s military power
to put down an armed insurrection too strong to be controlled by
civil authority,2241 and the organization and maintenance of an ac-
tive state militia is not a keeping of troops in time of peace within
the prohibition of this clause.2242
