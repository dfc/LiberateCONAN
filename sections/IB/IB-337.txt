the constitutionality of the measure was made by Hamilton, who
treated it as an “excise tax,” 1926 whereas Madison, both on the floor
of Congress and in correspondence, attacked it as “direct” and there-
fore void, because it was levied without apportionment.1927 The Court,
taking the position that the direct tax clause constituted in practi-
cal operation an exception to the general taxing powers of Con-
gress, held that no tax ought to be classified as “direct” that could
not be conveniently apportioned, and on this basis sustained the
tax on carriages as one on their “use” and therefore an “excise.”
Moreover, each of the judges advanced the opinion that the direct
tax clause should be restricted to capitation taxes and taxes on land,
or that, at most, it might cover a general tax on the aggregate or
mass of things that generally pervade all the states, especially if
an assessment should intervene, while Justice Paterson, who had
been a member of the Federal Convention, testified to his recollec-
tion that the principal purpose of the provision had been to allay
the fear of the Southern states that their Negroes and land should
be subjected to a specific tax.1928

From the Hylton to the Pollock Case
    The result of the Hylton case was not challenged until after the
Civil War. A number of the taxes imposed to meet the demands of
that war were assailed during the postwar period as direct taxes,
but without result. The Court sustained successively, as “excises”
or “duties,” a tax on an insurance company’s receipts for premiums
and assessments,1929 a tax on the circulating notes of state banks,1930
an inheritance tax on real estate,1931 and finally a general tax on
incomes.1932 In the last case, the Court took pains to state that it
regarded the term “direct taxes” as having acquired a definite and
fixed meaning, to wit, capitation taxes, and taxes on land.1933 Then,
almost one hundred years after the Hylton case, the famous case of
Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co.1934 arose under the Income
Tax Act of 1894.1935 Undertaking to correct “a century of error,” the

ing of the word excise is to be sought in the British statutes, it will be found to
include the duty on carriages, which is there considered as an excise, and then must
necessarily be uniform and liable to apportionment; consequently, not a direct tax.”
