the Commerce Clause is not concerned.” 976 As first enacted, the bounty
plan did not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state proces-
sors, but it was amended in a manner that substantially disadvan-
taged out-of-state processors. The Court held “that entry by the State
itself into the market itself as a purchaser, in effect, of a potential
article of interstate commerce [does not] create[ ] a burden upon
that commerce if the State restricts its trade to its own citizens or
businesses within the State.” 977
    Affirming and extending this precedent, the Court held that a
state operating a cement plant could in times of shortage (and pre-
sumably at any time) confine the sale of cement by the plant to
residents of the state.978 “[T]he Commerce Clause responds princi-
pally to state taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private
trade in the national marketplace. . . . There is no indication of a
constitutional plan to limit the ability of the States themselves to
operate freely in the free market.” 979 It is yet unclear how far this
concept of the state as market participant rather than market regu-
lator will be extended.980
    Congressional Authorization of Otherwise Impermissible
State Action.—The Supreme Court has heeded the lesson that was
administered to it by the Act of Congress of August 31, 1852,981 which
pronounced the Wheeling Bridge “a lawful structure,” thereby set-
ting aside the Court’s determination to the contrary earlier the same
year.982 The lesson, subsequently observed the Court, is that “[i]t is
Congress, and not the Judicial Department, to which the Constitu-
tion has given the power to regulate commerce.” 983 Similarly, when
in the late 1880s and the early 1890s statewide prohibition laws
began making their appearance, Congress again authorized state
laws that the Court had held to violate the dormant commerce clause.

     982 Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 54 U.S. (13 How.) 518 (1852),

statute sustained in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18
How.) 421 (1856). The latter decision seemed facially contrary to a dictum of Justice
Curtis in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299,
318 (1851), and cf. Tyler Pipe Indus., Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue,
483 U.S. 232, 263 n.4 (1987) (Justice Scalia concurring in part and dissenting in
part), but if indeed the Court is interpreting the silence of Congress as a bar to
action under the dormant commerce clause, then when Congress speaks it is enact-
ing a regulatory authorization for the states to act.
