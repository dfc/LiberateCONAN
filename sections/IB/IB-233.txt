on some of the union conduct in question.1221 A cease-and-desist or-
der of a state board implementing a state provision making it an
unfair labor practice for employees to conduct a slowdown or to oth-
erwise interfere with production while on the job was found not to
conflict with federal law,1222 and another order of the board was also
sustained in its prohibition of the discharge of an employee under
a maintenance-of-membership clause inserted in a contract under
pressure from the War Labor Board and which violated state law.1223
    By contrast, a state statute requiring business agents of unions
operating in the state to file annual reports and to pay an annual
fee of one dollar was voided as in conflict with federal law.1224 And
state statutes providing for mediation and outlawing public utility
strikes were similarly voided as being in specific conflict with fed-
eral law.1225 A somewhat different approach was noted in several
cases in which the Court held that the federal act had so occupied
the field in certain areas as to preclude state regulation.1226 The
latter approach was predominant through the 1950s, as the Court

    1222  United Automobile Workers v. WERB, 336 U.S. 245 (1949), overruled by Ma-
chinists & Aerospace Workers v. WERC, 427 U.S. 132 (1976).
     1223 Algoma Plywood Co. v. WERB, 336 U.S. 301 (1949).
     1224 Hill v. Florida ex rel. Watson, 325 U.S. 538 (1945). More recently, the Court

has held that Hill’s premise that the NLRA grants an unqualified right to select
union officials has been removed by amendments prohibiting some convicted crimi-
nals from holding union office. Partly because the federal disqualification standard
was itself dependent upon application of state law, the Court ruled that more strin-
gent state disqualification provisions, also aimed at individuals who had been in-
volved in racketeering and other criminal conduct, were not inconsistent with fed-
eral law. Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U.S. 491 (1984).

(finding a practice of a state labor commissioner preempted because it stood as an
obstacle to the achievement of the purposes of NLRA). Of course, where Congress
clearly specifies, the Court has had no difficulty. Thus, in the NLRA, Congress pro-
vided, 29 U.S.C. § 164(b), that state laws on the subject could override the federal
law on union security arrangements and the Court sustained those laws. Lincoln
Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525 (1949); AFL v.
American Sash & Door Co., 335 U.S. 538 (1949). When Congress in the Railway
Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. § 152, Eleventh, provided that the federal law on union secu-
rity was to override contrary state laws, the Court sustained that determination.
Railway Employes’ Dep’t v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956). The Court has held that
state courts may adjudicate questions relating to the permissibility of particular types
of union security arrangements under state law even though the issue involves as
well an interpretation of federal law. Retail Clerks Int’l Ass’n v. Schermerhorn, 375
U.S. 96 (1963).
