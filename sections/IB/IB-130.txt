another illustration. Because of the doctrine thus stated, the mea-
sure met no serious constitutional challenge either on the floors of
Congress or in the Courts.710
Congressional Regulation of Waterways
    Navigation.—In Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge
Co.,711 the Court granted an injunction requiring that a bridge erected
over the Ohio River under a charter from the State of Virginia ei-
ther be altered so as to admit of free navigation of the river or else
be entirely abated. The decision was justified on the basis both of
the Commerce Clause and of a compact between Virginia and Ken-
tucky, under which both these states had agreed to keep the Ohio
River “free and common to the citizens of the United States.” The
injunction was promptly rendered inoperative by an act of Con-
gress declaring the bridge to be “a lawful structure” and requiring
all vessels navigating the Ohio to be so regulated as not to inter-
fere with it.712 This act the Court sustained as within Congress’s
power under the Commerce Clause, saying: “So far . . . as this bridge
created an obstruction to the free navigation of the river, in view of
the previous acts of Congress, they are to be regarded as modified
by this subsequent legislation; and, although it still may be an ob-
struction in fact, [it] is not so in the contemplation of law. . . . [Con-
gress] having in the exercise of this power, regulated the naviga-
tion consistent with its preservation and continuation, the authority
to maintain it would seem to be complete. That authority combines
the concurrent powers of both governments, State and federal, which,
if not sufficient, certainly none can be found in our system of gov-
ernment.” 713 In short, it is Congress, and not the Court, which is
authorized by the Constitution to regulate commerce.714
    The law and doctrine of the earlier cases with respect to the
fostering and protection of navigation are well summed up in a fre-
     710 “No question is presented as to the power of the Congress, in its regulation

of interstate commerce, to regulate radio communication.” Chief Justice Hughes speak-
ing for the Court in Federal Radio Comm’n v. Nelson Bros. Bond & Mortgage Co.,
289 U.S. 266, 279 (1933). See also Fisher’s Blend Station v. Tax Comm’n, 297 U.S.
650, 654–55 (1936).

     713 Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 421, 430

(1856). “It is Congress, and not the Judicial Department, to which the Constitution
has given the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the sev-
eral States. The courts can never take the initiative on this subject.” Transportation
Co. v. Parkersburg, 107 U.S. 691, 701 (1883). See also Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benja-
min, 328 U.S. 408 (1946); Robertson v. California, 328 U.S. 440 (1946).
     714 But see In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895), in which the Court held that in the

absence of legislative authorization the Executive had power to seek and federal courts
to grant injunctive relief to remove obstructions to interstate commerce and the free
flow of the mail.
