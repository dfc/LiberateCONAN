ally populated district was 3,421 persons.301 Adhering to the prin-
ciple of strict population equality in a subsequent case, the Court
refused to find a plan valid simply because the variations were smaller
than the estimated census undercount. Rejecting the plan, the dif-
ference in population between the most and least populous dis-
tricts being 3,674 people, in a state in which the average district
population was 526,059 people, the Court opined that, given rapid
advances in computer technology, it is now “relatively simple to draw
contiguous districts of equal population and at the same time . . .
further whatever secondary goals the State has.” 302
    Attacks on partisan gerrymandering have proceeded under equal-
protection analysis, and, although the Court has held claims of de-
nial of effective representation to be justiciable, the standards are
so high that neither voters nor minority parties have yet benefitted
from the development.303

                       ELECTOR QUALIFICATIONS
    It was the original constitutional scheme to vest the determina-
tion of qualifications for electors in congressional elections 304 solely
in the discretion of the states, save only for the express require-
ment that the states could prescribe no qualifications other than
those provided for voters for the more numerous branch of the leg-
islature.305 This language has never been expressly changed, but
the discretion of the states—and not only with regard to the quali-
     301 White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783 (1973). The Court did set aside the district

court’s own plan for districting, instructing that court to adhere more closely to the
legislature’s own plan insofar as it reflected permissible goals of the legislators, re-
flecting an ongoing deference to legislatures in this area to the extent possible.
     302 Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 733 (1983). Illustrating the point about

computer-generated plans containing absolute population equality is Hastert v. State
Bd. of Elections, 777 F. Supp. 634 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (three-judge court), in which the
court adopted a congressional-districting plan in which 18 of the 20 districts had
571,530 people each and each of the other two had 571,531 people.
     303 The principal case was Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986), a legislative

apportionment case, but congressional districting is also covered. See Badham v. Eu,
694 F. Supp. 664 (N.D. Cal. 1988) (three-judge court) (adjudicating partisan gerry-
mandering claim as to congressional districts but deciding against plaintiffs on mer-
its), aff’d, 488 U.S. 1024 (1988); Pope v. Blue, 809 F. Supp. 392 (W.D.N.C. 1992)
(three-judge court) (same), aff’d, 506 U.S. 801 (1992); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S.
267 (2004) (same); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399
(2006) (same). Additional discussion of this issue appears under Amendment 14, The
New Equal Protection, Apportionment and Districting.
     304 The clause refers only to elections to the House of Representatives, of course,

and, inasmuch as Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures and presiden-
tial electors as the States would provide, it was only with the qualifications for these
voters with which the Constitution was originally concerned.

302 U.S. 277, 283 (1937). See 2 J. STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES 576–585 (1833).
