tion. By specific treaty provision, they yielded up other sovereign
powers, and Congress has removed still others. “The sovereignty that
the Indian tribes retain is of a unique and limited character. It ex-
ists only at the sufferance of Congress and is subject to complete
defeasance.” 1275
    In a case of major import for the settlement of Indian land claims,
the Court ruled in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation,1276
that an Indian tribe may obtain damages for wrongful possession
of land conveyed in 1795 without the federal approval required by
the Nonintercourse Act.1277 The Act reflected the accepted principle
that extinguishment of the title to land by Native Americans re-
quired the consent of the United States and left intact a tribe’s
common-law remedies to protect possessory rights. The Court reit-
erated the accepted rule that enactments are construed liberally in
favor of Native Americans and that Congress may abrogate Indian
treaty rights or extinguish aboriginal land title only if it does so
clearly and unambiguously. Consequently, federal approval of land-
conveyance treaties containing references to earlier conveyances that
had violated the Nonintercourse Act did not constitute ratification
of the invalid conveyances.1278 Similarly, the Court refused to apply
the general rule for borrowing a state statute of limitations for the
federal common-law action, and it rejected the dissent’s view that,
given “the extraordinary passage of time,” the doctrine of laches should
have been applied to bar the claim.1279
     Although the power of Congress over Indian affairs is broad, it
is not limitless.1280 The Court has promulgated a standard of re-
view that defers to the legislative judgment “[a]s long as the spe-
cial treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress’s
      1275 United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323 (1978). See South Dakota v.

Bourland, 508 U.S. 679 (1993) (abrogation of Indian treaty rights and reduction of
sovereignty). Congress may also remove restrictions on tribal sovereignty. The Court
has held that, absent authority from federal statute or treaty, tribes possess no crimi-
nal authority over non-Indians. Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191
(1978). The Court also held, in Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676 (1990), that a tribe has
no criminal jurisdiction over non-tribal Indians who commit crimes on the reserva-
tion; jurisdiction over members rests on consent of the self-governed, and absence of
consent defeats jurisdiction. Congress, however, quickly enacted a statute recogniz-
ing inherent authority of tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over
non-member Indians, and the Court upheld congressional authority to do so in United
States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004).
      1276 470 U.S. 226 (1985).
      1277 1 Stat. 379 (1793).
      1278 470 U.S. at 246–48.
      1279 470 U.S. at 255, 257 (Justice Stevens).
      1280 “The power of Congress over Indian affairs may be of a plenary nature; but

it is not absolute.” United States v. Alcea Bank of Tillamooks, 329 U.S. 40, 54 (1946)
(plurality opinion) (quoted with approval in Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v. Weeks,
430 U.S. 73, 84 (1977)).
