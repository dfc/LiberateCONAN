motels were declared covered—that is, declared to “affect com-
merce”—if they provided lodging to transient guests; restaurants,
cafeterias, and the like, were covered only if they served or offered
to serve interstate travelers or if a substantial portion of the food
which they served had moved in commerce.935 The Court sustained
the Act as applied to a downtown Atlanta motel that did serve in-
terstate travelers,936 to an out-of-the-way restaurant in Birming-
ham that catered to a local clientele but that had spent 46 percent
of its previous year’s out-go on meat from a local supplier who had
procured it from out-of-state,937 and to a rural amusement area op-
erating a snack bar and other facilities, which advertised in a man-
ner likely to attract an interstate clientele and that served food a
substantial portion of which came from outside the state.938
    Writing for the Court in Heart of Atlanta Motel and McClung,
Justice Clark denied that Congress was disabled from regulating
the operations of motels or restaurants because those operations may
be, or may appear to be, “local” in character. “[T]he power of Con-
gress to promote interstate commerce also includes the power to regu-
late the local incidents thereof, including local activities in both the
States of origin and destination, which might have a substantial
and harmful effect upon that commerce.” 939
    But, it was objected, Congress is regulating on the basis of moral
judgments and not to facilitate commercial intercourse. “That Con-
gress [may legislate] . . . against moral wrongs . . . rendered its
enactments no less valid. In framing Title II of this Act Congress
was also dealing with what it considered a moral problem. But that
fact does not detract from the overwhelming evidence of the disrup-
tive effect that racial discrimination has had on commercial inter-
course. It was this burden which empowered Congress to enact ap-
propriate legislation, and, given this basis for the exercise of its power,
Congress was not restricted by the fact that the particular obstruc-
tion to interstate commerce with which it was dealing was also deemed
a moral and social wrong.” 940 The evidence did, in fact, noted the
Justice, support Congress’s conclusion that racial discrimination im-
peded interstate travel by more than 20 million black citizens, which
was an impairment Congress could legislate to remove.941
