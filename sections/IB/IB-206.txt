tally granted monopoly—an exclusive franchise, indistinguishable
from a host of local monopolies at the state and local level.1102
    In United Haulers Ass’n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste
Management Authority,1103 the Court declined to apply Carbone where
haulers were required to bring waste to facilities owned and oper-
ated by a state-created public benefit corporation instead of to a
private processing facility, as was the case in Carbone. The Court
found this difference constitutionally significant because “[d]ispos-
ing of trash has been a traditional government activity for years,
and laws that favor the government in such areas—but treat every
private business, whether in-state or out-of-state, exactly the same—do
not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the
Commerce Clause. Applying the Commerce Clause test reserved for
regulations that do not discriminate against interstate commerce,
we uphold these ordinances because any incidental burden they may
have on interstate commerce does not outweigh the benefits they
confer . . . .” 1104
    In Department of Revenue of Kentucky v. Davis,1105 the Court
considered a challenge to the long-standing state practice of issu-
ing bonds for public purposes while exempting interest on the bonds
from state taxation.1106 In Davis, a challenge was brought against
Kentucky for such a tax exemption because it applied only to gov-
ernment bonds that Kentucky issued, and not to government bonds
issued by other states. The Court, however, recognizing the long pedi-
gree of such taxation schemes, applied the logic of United Haulers
Ass’n, Inc., noting that the issuance of debt securities to pay for
public projects is a “quintessentially public function,” and that Ken-
tucky’s differential tax scheme should not be treated like one that

149–59 (1994). Weight was given to this consideration by Justice O’Connor, 511 U.S.
at 401 (concurring) (local law an excessive burden on interstate commerce), and by
Justice Souter, id. at 410 (dissenting).
    1103 550 U.S. 330 (2007).
    1104 550 U.S. at 334. The Commerce Clause test referred to is the test set forth

in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970). “Under the Pike test, we will
uphold a nondiscriminatory statute . . . ‘unless the burden imposed on [interstate]
commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.’ ” Id. at 1797
(quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142). The fact that a state is seeking to protect itself
from economic or other difficulties, is not, by itself, sufficient to justify barriers to
interstate commerce. Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941) (striking down Cali-
fornia effort to bar “Okies”—persons fleeing the Great Plains dust bowl during the
Depression). Cf. Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 (1867) (without tying it to
any particular provision of Constitution, Court finds a protected right of interstate
movement). The right of travel is now an aspect of equal protection jurisprudence.

    1106 This exemption from state taxes is also generally made available to bonds

issued by local governmental entities within a state.
