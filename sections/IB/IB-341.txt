port cargo did not correspond reliably with the federal harbor ser-
vices used or usable by the exporter. Instead, the extent and man-
ner of port use depended on such factors as size and tonnage of a
vessel and the length of time it spent in port.1961 The HMT was
thus a tax, and therefore invalid.
     Where the sale to a commission merchant for a foreign con-
signee was consummated by delivery of the goods to an exporting
carrier, the sale was held to be a step in the exportation and hence
exempt from a general tax on sales of such commodity.1962 The giv-
ing of a bond for exportation of distilled liquor was not the com-
mencement of exportation so as to exempt from an excise tax spir-
its that were not exported pursuant to such bond.1963 A tax on the
income of a corporation derived from its export trade was not a tax
on “articles exported” within the meaning of the Constitution.1964
    In United States v. IBM Corp.,1965 the Court rejected the gov-
ernment’s argument that it should refine its export-tax-clause juris-
prudence. Rather than read the clause as a bar on any tax that
applies to a good in the export stream, the government contended
that the Court should bring this clause in line with the Import-
Export Clause 1966 and with dormant-commerce-clause doctrine. In
that view, the Court should distinguish between discriminatory and
nondiscriminatory taxes on exports. But the Court held that suffi-
cient differences existed between the export clause and the other
two clauses, so that its bar should continue to apply to any and all
taxes on goods in the course of exportation.

Stamp Taxes
    A stamp tax imposed on foreign bills of lading,1967 charter par-
ties,1968 or marine insurance policies,1969 was in effect a tax or duty
upon exports, and so void; but an act requiring the stamping of all

v. IBM Corp., 517 U.S. 843 (1996), the Court adhered to Thames & Mersey, and
held unconstitutional a federal excise tax upon insurance policies issued by foreign
countries as applied to coverage for exported products. The Court admitted that one
could question the earlier case’s equating of a tax on the insurance of exported goods
with a tax on the goods themselves, but it observed that the government had cho-
