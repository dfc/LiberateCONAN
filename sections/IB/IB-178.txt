with them and suggested that the power to regulate commerce be-
tween the states might be an exclusively federal power.960
    Chief Justice Marshall originated the concept of the “dormant
commerce clause” in Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co.,961 al-
though in dicta. Attacked before the Court was a state law autho-
rizing the building of a dam across a navigable creek, and it was
claimed the law was in conflict with the federal power to regulate
interstate commerce. Rejecting the challenge, Marshall said that the
state act could not be “considered as repugnant to the [federal] power
to regulate commerce in its dormant state . . . .”
    Returning to the subject in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port
of Philadelphia,962 the Court, upholding a state law that required
ships to engage a local pilot when entering or leaving the port of
Philadelphia, enunciated a doctrine of partial federal exclusivity. Ac-
cording to Justice Curtis’ opinion, the state act was valid on the
basis of a distinction between those subjects of commerce that “im-
peratively demand a single uniform rule” operating throughout the
country and those that “as imperatively” demand “that diversity which
alone can meet the local necessities of navigation,” that is to say, of
commerce. As to the former, the Court held Congress’s power to be
“exclusive”; as to the latter, it held that the states enjoyed a power
of “concurrent legislation.” 963 The Philadelphia pilotage require-
ment was of the latter kind.
    Thus, the contention that the federal power to regulate inter-
state commerce was exclusive of state power yielded to a rule of
partial exclusivity. Among the welter of such cases, the first actu-

     960 22 U.S. at 17–18, 209. In Sturges v. Crowninshield, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 122,

193–96 (1819), Chief Justice Marshall denied that the grant of the bankruptcy power
to Congress was exclusive. See also Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 1 (1820)
(militia).
     961 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 245, 252 (1829).
     962 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299 (1851). The issue of exclusive federal power and the

separate issue of the dormant commerce clause was present in the License Cases,
46 U.S. (5 How.) 504 (1847), and the Passenger Cases, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283 (1849),
but, despite the fact that much ink was shed in multiple opinions discussing the
questions, nothing definitive emerged. Chief Justice Taney, in contrast to Marshall,
viewed the clause only as a grant of power to Congress, containing no constraint
upon the states, and the Court’s role was to void state laws in contravention of fed-
eral legislation. 46 U.S. (5 How.) at 573; 48 U.S. (7 How.) at 464.
     963 48 U.S. at 317–20. Although Chief Justice Taney had formerly taken the strong

position that Congress’s power over commerce was not exclusive, he acquiesced si-
lently in the Cooley opinion. For a modern discussion of Cooley, see Goldstein v. Cali-
fornia, 412 U.S. 546, 552–60 (1973), in which, in the context of the Copyright Clause,
the Court, approving Cooley for Commerce Clause purposes, refused to find the Copy-
right Clause either fully or partially exclusive.
