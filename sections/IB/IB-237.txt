ing was the sole inquiry. Thus, there was deemed to be no realistic
risk of state interference with Board jurisdiction.1246
     Second, in determining whether the picketing was protected, the
Board would have been concerned with the situs of the picketing,
since under federal labor laws the employer has no absolute right
to prohibit union activity on his property. Preemption of state court
jurisdiction was denied, nonetheless, in this case on two joined bases.
One, preemption is not required in those cases in which the party
who could have presented the protection issue to the Board has not
done so and the other party to the dispute has no acceptable means
of doing so. In this case, the union could have filed with the Board
when the company demanded removal of the pickets, but did not,
and the company could not file with the Board at all. Two, even if
the matter is not presented to the Board, preemption is called for
if there is a risk of erroneous state court adjudication of the protec-
tion issue that is unacceptable, so that one must look to the strength
of the argument that the activity is protected. While the state court
had to make an initial determination that the trespass was not pro-
tected under federal law, the same determination the Board would
have made, in the instance of trespassory conduct, the risk of erro-
neous determination is small, because experience shows that a tres-
pass is far more likely to be unprotected than protected.1247
    Introduction of these two balancing tests into the Garmon ratio-
nale substantially complicates determining when state courts do not
have jurisdiction, and will no doubt occasion much more litigation
in state courts than has previously existed.
    Another series of cases involves not a Court-created exception
to the Garmon rule but the applicability and interpretation of § 301
of the Taft-Hartley Act,1248 which authorizes suits in federal, and
state,1249 courts to enforce collective bargaining agreements. The Court
has held that in enacting § 301, Congress authorized actions based
on conduct arguably subject to the NLRA, so that the Garmon pre-
emption doctrine does not preclude judicial enforcement of duties
and obligations which would otherwise be within the exclusive ju-
risdiction of the NLRB so long as those duties and obligations are
