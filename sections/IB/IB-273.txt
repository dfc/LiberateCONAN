       juries,1484 or subjecting a union of railway mail clerks to a general
       law forbidding any “labor organization” to deny any person member-
       ship because of his race, color or creed,1485 have been held not to
       conflict with national legislation or policy in this field. Despite the
       interference pro tanto with the performance of a federal function, a
       state may arrest a postal employee charged with murder while he
       is engaged in carrying out his official duties,1486 but it cannot pun-
       ish a person for operating a mail truck over its highways without
       procuring a driver’s license from state authorities.1487

                             COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS

       Origins and Scope of the Power
           This clause is the foundation upon which the national patent
       and copyright laws rest, although it uses neither of those terms. As
       to patents, modern legislation harks back to the Statute of Monopo-
       lies of 1624, whereby Parliament endowed inventors with the sole
       right to their inventions for fourteen years.1488 Copyright law, in
       turn, traces back to the Statute of Anne of 1710, which secured to
       authors of books sole publication rights for designated periods.1489
       These English statutes curtailed the royal prerogative to bestow mo-
       nopolies to Crown favorites over works and products they did not
       create and many of which had long been enjoyed by the public.1490
       Informed by these precedents and colonial practice, the Framers re-
       stricted the power to confer monopolies over the use of intellectual
       property through the Copyright and Patent Clause. For example,
       the “exclusive Right” conferred to the writings of authors and the
       discoveries of inventors must be time limited. Another fundamen-
       tal limitation inheres in the phrase “[t]o promote the Progress of
       Science and useful Arts”: To merit copyright protection, a work must
