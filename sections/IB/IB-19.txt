power to acquire territory, Marshall continues, arises, as “the inevi-
table consequence,” the right to govern it.43
    Subsequently, the Court has repeatedly ascribed powers to the
National Government on grounds that ill accord with the doctrine
of enumerated powers: the power to legislate in effectuation of the
“rights expressly given, and duties expressly enjoined” by the Con-
stitution; 44 the power to impart to the paper currency of the gov-
ernment the quality of legal tender in the payment of debts; 45 the
power to acquire territory by discovery; 46 the power to legislate for
the Indian tribes wherever situated in the United States; 47 the power
to exclude and deport aliens; 48 and to require that those who are
admitted be registered and fingerprinted; 49 and finally the com-
plete powers of sovereignty, both those of war and peace, in the con-
duct of foreign relations. Thus, in United States v. Curtiss-Wright
Export Corp.,50 decided in 1936, Justice Sutherland asserted the di-
chotomy of domestic and foreign powers, with the former limited
under the enumerated powers doctrine and the latter virtually free
of any such restraint. That doctrine has been the source of much
scholarly and judicial controversy, but, although limited, it has not
been repudiated.
    Yet, as Justice Sutherland pointed out, these holdings do not
directly affect “the internal affairs” of the nation, but instead relate
principally to its peripheral relations. The most serious inroads on
the doctrine of enumerated powers are, in fact, those that have taken
place under cover of the other doctrines. This would include the vast
expansion in recent years of the national legislative power under
the authority to regulate interstate commerce and the power to pro-
vide for the expenditure of the national revenues. Still, some of the
groundwork for these later doctrinal developments can be seen in
Justice Marshall’s language as quoted above from McCulloch.
