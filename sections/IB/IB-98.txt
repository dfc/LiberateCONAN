    In INS v. Chadha,516 the Court held a one-House congressional
veto to be unconstitutional as violating both the bicameralism prin-
ciples reflected in Art. I, §§ 1 and 7, and the presentment provi-
sions of § 7, cl. 2 and 3. The provision in question was § 244(c)(2) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorized either house
of Congress by resolution to veto the decision of the Attorney Gen-
eral to allow a particular deportable alien to remain in the country.
The Court’s analysis of the presentment issue made clear, however,
that two-House veto provisions, despite their compliance with bi-
cameralism, and committee veto provisions suffer the same consti-
tutional infirmity.517 In the words of dissenting Justice White, the
Court in Chadha “sound[ed] the death knell for nearly 200 other
statutory provisions in which Congress has reserved a ‘legislative
veto.’ ” 518
    In determining that veto of the Attorney General’s decision on
suspension of deportation was a legislative action requiring present-
ment to the President for approval or veto, the Court set forth the
general standard. “Whether actions taken by either House are, in
law and in fact, an exercise of legislative power depends not on their
form but upon ‘whether they contain matter which is properly to
be regarded as legislative in its character and effect.’ [T]he action
taken here . . . was essentially legislative,” the Court concluded, be-
cause “it had the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, du-
ties and relations of persons, including the Attorney General, Ex-
ecutive Branch officials and Chadha, all outside the legislative
branch.” 519
    The other major component of the Court’s reasoning in Chadha
stemmed from its reading of the Constitution as making only “ex-
plicit and unambiguous” exceptions to the bicameralism and pre-
nal Review of Agency Rules: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Rules of the House
of the House Rules Committee, 96th Congress, 1st sess. (1979); Regulatory Reform
Legislation: Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, 96th
Congress, 1st sess. (1979).
     516 462 U.S. 919 (1983).
     517 Shortly after deciding Chadha, the Court removed any doubts on this score

with summary affirmance of an appeals court’s invalidation of a two-House veto in
Consumers Union v. FTC, 691 F.2d 575 (D.C. Cir. 1982), aff’d sub nom. Process Gas
Consumers Group v. Consumer Energy Council, 463 U.S. 1216 (1983). Prior to Chadha,
an appellate court in AFGE v. Pierce, 697 F.2d 303 (D.C. Cir. 1982), had voided a
form of committee veto, a provision prohibiting the availability of certain funds for
a particular purpose without the prior approval of the Committees on Appropria-
tions.
     518 Chadha, 462 U.S. at 967. Justice Powell concurred separately, asserting that

Congress had violated separation of powers principles by assuming a judicial func-
tion in determining that a particular individual should be deported. Justice Powell
therefore found it unnecessary to express his view on “the broader question of whether
legislative vetoes are invalid under the Presentment Clauses.” Id. at 959.
     519 462 U.S. at 952 (citation omitted).
