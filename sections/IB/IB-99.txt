sentment requirements. Thus the House alone was given power of
impeachment, and the Senate alone was given power to convict upon
impeachment, to advise and consent to executive appointments, and
to advise and consent to treaties; similarly, the Congress may pro-
pose a constitutional amendment without the President’s approval,
and each House is given autonomy over certain “internal matters,”
e.g., judging the qualifications of its members. By implication then,
exercises of legislative power not falling within any of these “nar-
row, explicit, and separately justified” exceptions must conform to
the prescribed procedures: “passage by a majority of both Houses
and presentment to the President.” 520
    The breadth of the Court’s ruling in Chadha was evidenced in
its 1986 decision in Bowsher v. Synar.521 Among that case’s ratio-
nales for holding the Deficit Control Act unconstitutional was that
Congress had, in effect, retained control over executive action in a
manner resembling a congressional veto. “[A]s Chadha makes clear,
once Congress makes its choice in enacting legislation, its partici-
pation ends. Congress can thereafter control the execution of its en-
actment only indirectly—by passing new legislation.” 522 Congress
had offended this principle by retaining removal authority over the
Comptroller General, charged with executing important aspects of
the Budget Act.
    That Chadha does not spell the end of some forms of the legis-
lative veto is evident from events since 1983, which have seen the
enactment of various devices, such as “report and wait” provisions
and requirements for various consultative steps before action may
be undertaken. But the decision has stymied the efforts in Con-
gress to confine the discretion it confers through delegation by giv-
ing it a method of reviewing and if necessary voiding actions and
rules promulgated after delegations.
     The Line Item Veto.—For more than a century, United States
Presidents had sought the authority to strike out of appropriations
bills particular items—to veto “line items” of money bills and some-
times legislative measures as well. Finally, in 1996, Congress ap-
proved and the President signed the Line Item Veto Act.523 The law
empowered the President, within five days of signing a bill, to “can-
cel in whole” spending items and targeted, defined tax benefits. In
acting on this authority, the President was to determine that the

greater length in the concurring opinion of Justice Stevens. Id. at 736.
