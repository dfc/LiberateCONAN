serve such waters for the use of public. The trust devolving upon
the State for the public, and which can only be discharged by the
management and control of property in which the public has an in-
terest, cannot be relinquished by a transfer of the property. . . . Any
grant of the kind is necessarily revocable, and the exercise of the
trust by which the property was held by the State can be resumed
at any time.” 2143
     On the other hand, repeated endeavors to subject tax exemp-
tions to the doctrine of inalienability, though at times supported by
powerful minorities on the Bench, have failed.2144 As recently as Janu-
ary 1952, the Court ruled that the Georgia Railway Company was
entitled to seek an injunction in the federal courts against an at-
tempt by Georgia’s Revenue Commission to compel it to pay ad va-
lorem taxes contrary to the terms of its special charter issued in
1833. In answer to the argument that this was a suit contrary to
the Eleventh Amendment, the Court declared that the immunity
from federal jurisdiction created by the Amendment “does not ex-
tend to individuals who act as officers without constitutional author-
ity.” 2145
     The leading case involving the police power is Stone v. Missis-
sippi.2146 In 1867, the legislature of Mississippi chartered a com-
pany to which it expressly granted the power to conduct a lottery.
Two years later, the state adopted a new Constitution which con-
tained a provision forbidding lotteries, and a year later the legisla-
ture passed an act to put this provision into effect. In upholding
this act and the constitutional provision on which it was based, the
Court said: “The power of governing is a trust committed by the
people to the government, no part of which can be granted away.
The people, in their sovereign capacity, have established their agen-
cies for the preservation of the public health and the public mor-
als, and the protection of public and private rights,” and these agen-
cies can neither give away nor sell their discretion. All that one can
get by a charter permitting the business of conducting a lottery “is
suspension of certain governmental rights in his favor, subject to
withdrawal at will.” 2147

Court distinguished In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443 (1887) on the ground that the action
there was barred “as one in substance directed at the State merely to obtain specific
performance of a contract with the State.” 342 U.S. at 305.
