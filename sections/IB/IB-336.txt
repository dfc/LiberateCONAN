        passage of the law was held not to impose a punishment, but in-
        stead simply to deprive the alien of his ill-gotten privileges.1919

        Change in Place or Mode of Trial
            A change of the place of trial of an alleged offense after its com-
        mission is not an ex post facto law. If no place of trial was provided
        when the offense was committed, Congress may designate the place
        of trial thereafter.1920 A law that alters the rule of evidence to per-
        mit a person to be convicted upon less or different evidence than
        was required when the offense was committed is invalid,1921 but a
        statute that simply enlarges the class of persons who may be com-
        petent to testify in criminal cases is not ex post facto as applied to
        a prosecution for a crime committed prior to its passage.1922

    Clause 4. No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,
unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein be-
fore directed to be taken.
                                       DIRECT TAXES

        The Hylton Case
            The crucial problem under clause 4 is to distinguish “direct” from
        other taxes. In its opinion in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co.,
        the Court declared: “It is apparent . . . that the distinction be-
        tween direct and indirect taxation was well understood by the fram-
        ers of the Constitution and those who adopted it.” 1923 Against this
        confident dictum may be set the following brief excerpt from Madi-
        son’s Notes on the Convention: “Mr. King asked what was the pre-
        cise meaning of direct taxation? No one answered.” 1924 The first case
        to come before the Court on this issue was Hylton v. United States,1925
        which was decided early in 1796. Congress has levied, according to
        the rule of uniformity, a specific tax upon all carriages, for the con-
        veyance of persons, which were to be kept by, or for any person, for
        his own use, or to be let out for hire, or for the conveying of passen-
        gers. In a fictitious statement of facts, it was stipulated that the
        carriages involved in the case were kept exclusively for the per-
        sonal use of the owner and not for hire. The principal argument for
