    When, in the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, Congress au-
thorized the President “to issue such orders and regulations as he
may deem appropriate to stabilize prices, rents, wages, and sala-
ries,” and the President responded by imposing broad national con-
trols, the lower court decision sustaining the action was not even
appealed to the Supreme Court.122 Explicit standards are not even
required in all situations, the Court having found standards reason-
ably implicit in a delegation to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
to regulate banking associations.123 Even in “sweeping regulatory
schemes” that affect the entire economy, the Court has “never de-
manded . . . that statutes provide a ‘determinate criterion’ for say-
ing ‘how much [of the regulated harm] is too much.’ ” 124 Thus Con-
gress need not quantify how “imminent” is too imminent, how
“necessary” is necessary enough, how “hazardous” is too hazardous,
or how much profit is “excess.” Rather, discretion to make such de-
terminations may be conferred on administrative agencies.125
     For a time, the Court appeared to have approved a bootstrap
theory under which administrative implementation of a congressio-
nal enactment could provide the intelligible standard necessary to
uphold a delegation. The Court’s decision in Lichter v. United States 126
relied on an administrative interpretation of the term “excessive prof-
its” as applied to the performance of certain wartime government
contracts, and was applied to profits earned prior to Congress’s in-
corporation into the statute of the administrative interpretation.127
The Court, however, subsequently rejected the idea in Whitman v.
American Trucking Associations.128 In Whitman, the Court as-
serted that Lichter mentioned agency regulations only “because a
subsequent Congress had incorporated the regulations into a re-
vised version of the statute.” 129 “We have never suggested that an

     127 In upholding the delegation as applied to the pre-incorporation administra-

tive definition, the Court explained that “[t]he statutory term ‘excessive profits,’ in
its context, was a sufficient expression of legislative policy and standards to render
it constitutional.” 334 U.S. at 783. The “excessive profits” standard, prior to defini-
tion, was contained in Tit. 8 of the Act of October 21, 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 982. The
administrative definition was added by Tit. 7 of the Act of February 25, 1944, 58
Stat. 21, 78.
