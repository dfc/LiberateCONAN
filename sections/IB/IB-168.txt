fell within the three broad categories of activity that Congress may
regulate or protect under its commerce power: (1) use of the chan-
nels of interstate commerce, (2) the use of instrumentalities of in-
terstate commerce, or (3) activities that substantially affect inter-
state commerce.906
     Clearly, the Court said, the criminalized activity did not impli-
cate the first two categories.907 As for the third, the Court found an
insufficient connection. First, a wide variety of regulations of “intra-
state economic activity” has been sustained where an activity sub-
stantially affects interstate commerce. But the statute being chal-
lenged, the Court continued, was a criminal law that had nothing
to do with “commerce” or with “any sort of economic enterprise.”
Therefore, it could not be sustained under precedents “upholding
regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a
commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substan-
tially affects interstate commerce.” 908 The provision did not con-
tain a “jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-
case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate
commerce.” 909 The existence of such a section, the Court implied,
would have saved the constitutionality of the provision by requir-
ing a showing of some connection to commerce in each particular
case.
    Finally, the Court rejected the arguments of the government and
of the dissent that there existed a sufficient connection between the
offense and interstate commerce.910 At base, the Court’s concern was
that accepting the attenuated connection arguments presented would
result in the evisceration of federalism. “Under the theories that
the government presents . . . it is difficult to perceive any limita-
tion on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforce-
ment or education where States historically have been sovereign.
Thus, if we were to accept the Government’s arguments, we are hard
pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is with-
out power to regulate.” 911
    Whether Lopez bespoke a Court determination to police more
closely Congress’s exercise of its commerce power, so that it would
