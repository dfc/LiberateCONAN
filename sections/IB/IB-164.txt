substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that
substantially affect interstate commerce.” 883
     An example of the first category, regulating to protect the chan-
nels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, is Pierce County
v. Guillen,884 in which the Court upheld a prohibition on the use in
state or federal court proceedings of highway data required to be
collected by states on the basis that “Congress could reasonably be-
lieve that adopting a measure eliminating an unforeseen side effect
of the information-gathering requirement . . . would result in more
diligent efforts [by states] to collect the relevant information.”
     Under the second category, which attaches to instrumentali-
ties 885 and persons crossing of state lines, Congress has validly leg-
islated to protect interstate travelers from harm, to prevent such
travelers from being deterred in the exercise of interstate travel-
ing, and to prevent them from being burdened. Many of the 1964
public accommodations law applications have been premised on the
point that larger establishments do serve interstate travelers and
that even small stores, restaurants, and the like may serve inter-
state travelers, and, therefore, it is permissible to regulate them to
prevent or deter racial discrimination.886
    Commerce regulation under this second category is not limited
to persons who cross state lines but can also extend to an object
that will or has crossed state lines, and the regulation of a purely
intrastate activity may be premised on the presence of such object.
Thus, the public accommodations law reached small establish-
ments that served food and other items that had been purchased
from interstate channels.887 Congress has validly penalized con-
victed felons, who had no other connection to interstate commerce,
for possession or receipt of firearms, which had been previously trans-
ported in interstate commerce independently of any activity by the
two felons.888

shipments. Accord Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 150 (1971).

lice powers of the states, the Court insists Congress clearly speak to its intent to
cover such local activities. United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971). See also Rewis
v. United States, 401 U.S. 808 (1971); United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396 (1973).
