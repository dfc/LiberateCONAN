drafted and loosely worded . . . resolutions can leave tremendous
latitude to the discretion of the investigators. The more vague the
committee’s charter is, the greater becomes the possibility that the
committee’s specific actions are not in conformity with the will of
the parent house of Congress.” Speaking directly of the authorizing
resolution, which created the House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee,228 the Chief Justice thought it “difficult to imagine a less
explicit authorizing resolution.” 229 But the far-reaching implica-
tions of these remarks were circumscribed by Barenblatt v. United
States,230 in which the Court, “[g]ranting the vagueness of the Rule,”
noted that Congress had long since put upon it a persuasive gloss
of legislative history through practice and interpretation, which, read
with the enabling resolution, showed that “the House has clothed
the Un-American Activities Committee with pervasive authority to
investigate Communist activities in this country.” 231 “[W]e must con-
clude that [the Committee’s] authority to conduct the inquiry pres-
ently under consideration is unassailable, and that . . . the Rule
cannot be said to be constitutionally infirm on the score of vague-
ness.” 232
    Because of the usual precision with which authorizing resolu-
tions have generally been drafted, few controversies have arisen about
whether a committee has projected its inquiry into an area not sanc-
tioned by the parent body.233 But in United States v. Rumely,234 the
Court held that the House of Representatives, in authorizing a se-
lect committee to investigate lobbying activities devoted to the pro-
motion or defeat of legislation, did not thereby intend to empower
the committee to probe activities of a lobbyist that were uncon-
nected with his representations directly to Congress but rather de-
signed to influence public opinion by distribution of literature. Con-
sequently the committee was without authority to compel the

contesting the constitutionality of the Rule establishing the Committee on allega-

close the contention.
