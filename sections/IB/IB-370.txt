    An excellent illustration of the operation of the rule in relation
to tax exemptions was furnished by the derivative doctrine that an
immunity of this character must be deemed as intended solely for
the benefit of the corporation receiving it and hence, in the absence
of express permission by the state, may not be passed on to a suc-
cessor.2124 Thus, where two companies, each exempt from taxation,
were permitted by the legislature to consolidate, the new corpora-
tion was held to be subject to taxation.2125 Again, a statute that
granted a corporation all “the rights and privileges” of an earlier
corporation was held not to confer the latter’s “immunity” from taxa-
tion.2126 Yet again, a legislative authorization of the transfer by one
corporation to another of the former’s “estate, property, right, privi-
leges, and franchises” was held not to clothe the later company with
the earlier one’s exemption from taxation.2127
    Furthermore, an exemption from taxation is to be strictly con-
strued even in the hands of one clearly entitled to it. Thus, the ex-
emption conferred by its charter on a railway company was held
not to extend to branch roads it constructed pursuant to a later
statute.2128 Also, a general exemption of the property of a corpora-
tion from taxation was held to refer only to the property actually
employed in its business.2129 And, the charter exemption of the capi-
tal stock of a railroad from taxation “for ten years after completion
of the said road” was held not to become operative until the comple-
tion of the road.2130 So also the exemption of the campus and en-
dowment fund of a college was held to leave other lands of the col-
lege, though a part of its endowment, subject to taxation.2131 Provisions
in a statute that bonds of the state and its political subdivisions
were not to be taxed and should not be taxed were held not to ex-
empt interest on them from taxation as income of the owners.2132
