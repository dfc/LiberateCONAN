poused a different interpretation, contending that the Constitution
vested in Congress the power to initiate war but that when an-
other nation made war upon the United States we were already in
a state of war and no declaration by Congress was needed.1598 Con-
gress thereafter enacted a statute authorizing the President to in-
struct the commanders of armed vessels of the United States to seize
all vessels and goods of the Bey of Tripoli “and also to cause to be
done all such other acts of precaution or hostility as the state of
war will justify . . . .” 1599 But no formal declaration of war was passed,
Congress apparently accepting Hamilton’s view.1600
     Sixty years later, the Supreme Court sustained the blockade of
the Southern ports instituted by Lincoln in April 1861 at a time
when Congress was not in session.1601 Congress had subsequently
ratified Lincoln’s action,1602 so that it was unnecessary for the Court
to consider the constitutional basis of the President’s action in the
absence of congressional authorization, but the Court nonetheless
approved, five-to-four, the blockade order as an exercise of Presiden-
tial power alone, on the ground that a state of war was a fact. “The
President was bound to meet it in the shape it presented itself, with-
out waiting for Congress to baptize it with a name; and no name
given to it by him or them could change the fact.” 1603 The minority
challenged this doctrine on the ground that while the President could
unquestionably adopt such measures as the laws permitted for the
enforcement of order against insurgency, Congress alone could stamp
an insurrection with the character of war and thereby authorize the
legal consequences ensuing from a state of war.1604
    The view of the majority was proclaimed by a unanimous Court
a few years later when it became necessary to ascertain the exact
dates on which the war began and ended. The Court, the Chief Jus-
tice said, must “refer to some public act of the political depart-
ments of the government to fix the dates; and, for obvious reasons,
those of the executive department, which may be, and, in fact, was,
at the commencement of hostilities, obliged to act during the recess
of Congress, must be taken. The proclamation of intended blockade
