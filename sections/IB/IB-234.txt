voided state court action in enjoining 1227 or awarding damages 1228
for peaceful picketing, in awarding of relief by damages or other-
wise for conduct that constituted an unfair labor practice under fed-
eral law,1229 or in enforcing state antitrust laws so as to affect col-
lective bargaining agreements 1230 or to bar a strike as a restraint
of trade,1231 even with regard to disputes over which the NLRB de-
clined to assert jurisdiction because of the degree of effect on inter-
state commerce.
    In San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,1232 the Court
enunciated the rule, based on its previous decade of adjudication.
“When an activity is arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the Act, the
States . . . must defer to the exclusive competence of the National
Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with na-
tional policy is to be averted.” 1233
    For much of the period since Garmon, the dispute in the Court
concerned the scope of the few exceptions permitted in the Garmon
principle. First, when picketing is not wholly peaceful but is at-
tended by intimidation, violence, and obstruction of the roads afford-
ing access to the struck establishment, state police powers have been
held not disabled to deal with the conduct and narrowly drawn in-
junctions directed against violence and mass picketing have been
permitted 1234 as well as damages to compensate for harm growing
out of such activities.1235
    A 1958 case permitted a successful state court suit for reinstate-
ment and damages for lost pay because of a wrongful expulsion,
leading to discharge from employment, based on a theory that the
union constitution and by-laws constitute a contract between the
union and the members the terms of which can be enforced by state
courts without the danger of a conflict between state and federal
