     “The right of a person to become a naturalized citizen of the
United States shall not be denied or abridged because of race or
sex or because such person is married.” 1305 However, any person
“who advocates or teaches, or who is a member of or affiliated with
any organization that advocates or teaches . . . opposition to all or-
ganized government,” or “who advocates or teaches or who is a mem-
ber of or affiliated with any organization that advocates or teaches
the overthrow by force or violence or other unconstitutional means
of the Government of the United States” or who is a member of or
affiliated with the Communist Party, or other communist organiza-
tions, or other totalitarian organizations is ineligible.1306 These pro-
visions moreover are “applicable to any applicant for naturaliza-
tion who at any time within a period of ten years immediately
preceding the filing of the petition for naturalization or after such
filing and before taking the final oath of citizenship is, or has been
found to be, within any of the classes enumerated within this sec-
tion, notwithstanding that at the time the petition is filed he may
not be included within such classes.” 1307
     Other limitations on eligibility are also imposed. Eligibility may
turn upon the decision of the responsible officials whether the peti-
tioner is of “good moral character.” 1308 The immigration and nation-
ality laws themselves include a number of specific congressional de-
terminations that certain persons do not possess “good moral
character,” including persons who are “habitual drunkards,” 1309 adul-
terers,1310 polygamists or advocates of polygamy,1311 gamblers,1312
convicted felons,1313 and homosexuals.1314 In order to petition for
naturalization, an alien must have been resident for at least five
years and to have possessed “good moral character” for all of that
period.
     The process of naturalization culminates in the taking in open
court of an oath “(1) to support the Constitution of the United States;
(2) to renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and

    1306  § 313(a), 66 Stat. 240 (1952), 8 U.S.C. § 1424(a). Whether “mere” member-
ship is sufficient to constitute grounds for ineligibility is unclear. Compare Galvan v.
Press, 347 U.S. 522 (1954), with Berenyi v. Immigration Director, 385 U.S. 630 (1967).

“psychopathic personality,” “a term of art intended to exclude homosexuals from en-
try into the United States.” Boutilier v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 387
