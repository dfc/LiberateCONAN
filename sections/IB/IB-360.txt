contracts and those which are mere revocable licenses, although on
account of the doctrine of presumed consideration mentioned ear-
lier, this has not always been easy to do. In pursuance of the prec-
edent set in New Jersey v. Wilson,2083 the legislature of a state “may
exempt particular parcels of property or the property of particular
persons or corporations from taxation, either for a specified period
or perpetually, or may limit the amount or rate of taxation, to which
such property shall be subjected,” and such an exemption is fre-
quently a contract within the sense of the Constitution. Indeed this
is always so when the immunity is conferred upon a corporation by
the clear terms of its charter.2084 When, on the other hand, an im-
munity of this sort springs from general law, its precise nature is
more open to doubt, as a comparison of decisions will serve to illus-
trate.
    In State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop,2085 a closely divided Court held
that a general banking law of Ohio, which provided that compa-
nies complying therewith and their stockholders should be exempt
from all but certain taxes, was, as to a bank organized under it
and its stockholders, a contract within the meaning of Article I, § 10.
The provision was not, the Court said, “a legislative command nor
a rule of taxation until changed, but a contract stipulating against
any change, from the nature of the language used and the circum-
stances under which it was adopted.” 2086 When, however, the State
of Michigan pledged itself, by a general legislative act, not to tax
any corporation, company, or individual undertaking to manufac-
ture salt in the state from water there obtained by boring on prop-
erty used for this purpose and, furthermore, to pay a bounty on
the salt so manufactured, it was held not to have engaged itself
within the constitutional sense. “General encouragements,” the Court
wrote, “held out to all persons indiscriminately, to engage in a par-
ticular trade or manufacture, whether such encouragement be in
the shape of bounties or drawbacks, or other advantage, are al-
ways under the legislative control, and may be discontinued at any
time.” 2087 So far as exemption from taxation is concerned the differ-

ally affect an already accrued right to compensation.
