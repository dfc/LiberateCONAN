. . . .” 1471 Again, when the Court sustained an order of the Postmas-
ter General excluding from the second-class privilege a newspaper
he had found to have published material in contravention of the
Espionage Act of 1917, the claim of absolute power in Congress to
withhold the privilege was sedulously avoided.1472
    A unanimous Court transformed these reservations into a hold-
ing in Lamont v. Postmaster General,1473 in which it struck down a
statute authorizing the Post Office to detain mail it determined to
be “communist political propaganda” and to forward it to the ad-
dressee only if he notified the Post Office he wanted to see it. Not-
ing that Congress was not bound to operate a postal service, the
Court observed that while it did, it was bound to observe constitu-
tional guarantees.1474 The statute violated the First Amendment be-
cause it inhibited the right of persons to receive any information
that they wished to receive.1475
    On the other hand, a statute authorizing persons to place their
names on a list in order to reject receipt of obscene or sexually sug-
gestive materials is constitutional, because no sender has a right
to foist his material on any unwilling receiver.1476 But, as in other
areas, postal censorship systems must contain procedural guaran-
tees sufficient to ensure prompt resolution of disputes about the char-
acter of allegedly objectionable material consistently with the First
Amendment.1477

     1474 381 U.S. at 305, quoting Justice Holmes in United States ex rel. Milwau-

kee Social Democratic Pub. Co. v. Burleson, 255 U.S. 407, 437 (1921) (dissenting
opinion): “The United States may give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while
it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the
right to use our tongues. . . .” See also Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410, 416 (1971)
(quoting same language). But for a different perspective on the meaning and appli-
cation of Holmes’ language, see United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh
Civic Assn’s, 453 U.S. 114, 127 n.5 (1981), although there too the Court observed
that the postal power may not be used in a manner that abridges freedom of speech
or press. Id. at 126. Notice, too, that first-class mail is protected against opening
and inspection, except in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. Ex parte Jack-
son, 96 U.S. 727, 733 (1878); United States v. van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249 (1970).
