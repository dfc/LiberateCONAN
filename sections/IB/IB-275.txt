tive authority conferred by the Copyright Clause.” 1495 The Act, the
Court concluded, “reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically
makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature’s
domain.” 1496 Moreover, the duration of copyrights and patents may
be prolonged and, even then, the limits may not be easily enforced.
The protection period may extend well beyond the life of the au-
thor or inventor.1497 Also, in extending the duration of existing copy-
rights and patents, Congress may protect the rights of purchasers
and assignees.1498
    The copyright and patent laws do not, of their own force, have
any extraterritorial operation.1499

Patentable Discoveries
    The protection traditionally afforded by acts of Congress under
this clause has been limited to new and useful inventions,1500 and,
although a patentable invention is a mental achievement,1501 for an
idea to be patentable it must have first taken physical form.1502 De-
    1495  537 U.S. at 204.
    1496  537 U.S. at 205.
     1497 The Court in Eldred upheld extension of the term of existing copyrights from

life of the author plus 50 years to life of the author plus 70 years. Although the
more general issue was not raised, the Court opined that this length of time, extend-
able by Congress, was “clearly” not a regime of “perpetual” copyrights. The only two
dissenting Justices, Stevens and Breyer, challenged this assertion.

(“The presumption that United States law governs domestically but does not rule
the world applies with particualr force in patent law”.). It is, however, the ultimate
objective of many nations, including the United States, to develop a system of pat-
ent issuance and enforcement which transcends national boundaries; it has been rec-
ommended, therefore, that United States policy should be to harmonize its patent
system with that of foreign countries so long as such measures do not diminish the
quality of the United States patent standards. President’s Commission on the Pat-
ent System, To Promote the Progress of Useful Arts, Report to the Senate Judiciary
Committee, S. Doc. No. 5, 90th Cong., 1st sess. (1967), recommendation XXXV. Ef-
fectuation of this goal of transnational protection of intellectual property was begun
with the United States agreement to the Berne Convention (the Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Sept. 9, 1886), and Congress’s conditional
implementation of the Convention through legislation. The Berne Convention Imple-
