    Clause 6. No Preference shall be given by any Regulation
of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of
another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged
to enter, clear, or pay duties in another.

                           THE “NO PREFERENCE” CLAUSE
            The no-preference clause was designed to prevent preferences
        between ports because of their location in different states. Discrimi-
        nations between individual ports are not prohibited. Acting under
        the Commerce Clause, Congress may do many things that benefit
        particular ports and that incidentally result to the disadvantage of
        other ports in the same or neighboring states. It may establish ports
        of entry, erect and operate lighthouses, improve rivers and harbors,
        and provide structures for the convenient and economical handling
        of traffic.1971 A rate order of the Interstate Commerce Commission
        that allowed an additional charge to be made for ferrying traffic
        across the Mississippi to cities on the east bank of the river was
        sustained over the objection that it gave an unconstitutional prefer-
        ence to ports in Texas.1972 Although there were a few early intima-
        tions that this clause was applicable to the states as well as to Con-
        gress,1973 the Supreme Court declared emphatically in 1886 that state
        legislation was unaffected by it.1974 After more than a century, the
        Court confirmed, over the objection that this clause was offended,

        sen not to present that argument. Principles of stare decisis thus cautioned obser-
        vance of the earlier case. Id. at 854–55. The dissenters argued that the issue had
        been presented and should be decided by overruling the earlier case. Id. at 863 (Jus-
        tices Kennedy and Ginsburg dissenting).

        (1921), the argument that an act of Congress which prohibited interstate transpor-
        tation of liquor into states whose laws prohibited manufacture or sale of liquor for
        beverage purposes was repugnant to this clause was rejected.
