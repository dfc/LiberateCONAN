selves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate com-
merce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be main-
tained that their industrial labor relations constitute a forbidden
field into which Congress may not enter when it is necessary to
protect interstate commerce from the paralyzing consequences of in-
dustrial war? We have often said that interstate commerce itself is
a practical conception. It is equally true that interferences with that
commerce must be appraised by a judgment that does not ignore
actual experience.” 818
     While the Act was thus held to be within the constitutional pow-
ers of Congress in relation to a productive concern because the in-
terruption of its business by strike “might be catastrophic,” the de-
cision was forthwith held to apply also to two minor concerns,819
and in a later case the Court stated specifically that the smallness
of the volume of commerce affected in any particular case is not a
material consideration.820 Subsequently, the act was declared to be
applicable to a local retail auto dealer on the ground that he was
an integral part of the manufacturer’s national distribution sys-
tem,821 to a labor dispute arising during alteration of a county court-
house because one-half of the cost—$225,000—was attributable to
materials shipped from out-of-state,822 and to a dispute involving a
retail distributor of fuel oil, all of whose sales were local, but who
obtained the oil from a wholesaler who imported it from another
state.823
     Indeed, “[t]his Court has consistently declared that in passing
the National Labor Relations Act, Congress intended to and did vest
in the Board the fullest jurisdictional breadth constitutionally per-
missible under the Commerce Clause.” 824 Thus, the Board has for-
mulated jurisdictional standards which assume the requisite effect
on interstate commerce from a prescribed dollar volume of busi-
ness and these standards have been implicitly approved by the
Court.825
