federal prisoner past the term of his imprisonment 1836 if that pris-
oner would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually vio-
lent conduct or child molestation. The statute contained no require-
ment that the threatened future conduct would fall under federal
jurisdiction, raising the question of what constitutional basis could
be cited for its enforcement. The majority opinion in Comstock up-
held the statute after considering five factors: (1) the historic breadth
of the Necessary and Proper Clause; (2) the history of federal in-
volvement in this area; (3) the reason for the statute’s enactment;
(4) the statute’s accommodation of state interests; and (5) whether
the scope of statute was too attenuated from Article I powers.1837
    In evaluating these factors, the Court noted that previous fed-
eral involvement in the area included not only the civil commit-
ment of defendants who were incompetent to stand trial or who be-
came insane during the course of their imprisonment, but, starting
in 1949, the continued confinement of those adjudged incompetent
or insane past the end of their prison term. In upholding the sex
offender statute, the Court found that protection of the public and
the probability that such prisoners would not be committed by the
state represented a “rational basis” for the passage of such legisla-
tion.1838 The Court further found that state interests were pro-
tected by the legislation, as the statute provided for transfer of the
committed individuals to state authorities willing to accept them.
Finally, the Court found that the statute was not too attenuated
from the Article I powers underlying the criminal laws which had
been the basis for incarceration, as it related to the responsible ad-
ministration of the United States prison system.

     1836 Where an ex-convict is still subject to legal requirements related to his pre-

vious conviction, the Court has found little difficultly in those requirements being
varied after his release. In United States v. Kebodeaux, 570 U.S. ___, No. 12–418,
slip op. (2013), the Court found that a sex offender, convicted by the Air Force in a
special court-martial, had, upon his release, been subject to state sex offender regis-
tration laws, violation of which was prohibited under the Jacob Wetterling Crimes
Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub. L. No., 103–
322, 108 Stat. 2038–2042. When he was later convicted of failing to register under
the “very similar” provisions of the later-enacted Sex Offender Registration and No-
tification Act (SORNA), Public Law 109–24, Title I, 120 Stat. 590, 42 U.S.C. §16901
et seq., the Court found the Congress was well within its authority under the Nec-
essary and Proper Clause to have modified the registration requirements.
     1837 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–1224, slip op. at 22.
     1838 Justice Kennedy, in concurrence, expressed concern that whether a statute

is “rationally related” to the implementation of a power, see Williamson v. Lee Opti-
cal Co., 348 U.S. 483, 487–88 (1955) (Due Process Clause), is too deferential a stan-
dard to be used as regards the Necessary and Proper Clause. Justice Kennedy would
use a more rigorous “rational basis” standard, found in Commerce Clause cases, where
there must be shown a “demonstrated link in fact, based on empirical demonstra-
tion.” See Comstock, 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–1224, slip op. at 3 (Kennedy, J., concur-
ring).
