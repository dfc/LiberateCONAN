    The Commerce Clause basis for civil rights legislation prohibit-
ing private discrimination was important because of the understand-
ing that Congress’s power to act under the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments was limited to official discrimination.942 The
Court’s subsequent determination that Congress is not necessarily
so limited in its power reduces greatly the importance of the Com-
merce Clause in this area.943
    Criminal Law.—Federal criminal jurisdiction based on the com-
merce power, and frequently combined with the postal power, has
historically been an auxiliary criminal jurisdiction. That is, Con-
gress has made federal crimes of acts that constitute state crimes
on the basis of some contact, however tangential, with a matter sub-
ject to congressional regulation even though the federal interest in
the acts may be minimal.944 Examples of this type of federal crimi-
nal statute abound, including the Mann Act designed to outlaw in-
terstate white slavery,945 the Dyer Act punishing interstate trans-
portation of stolen automobiles,946 and the Lindbergh Law punishing
interstate transportation of kidnapped persons.947 But, just as in
other areas, Congress has passed beyond a proscription of the use
of interstate facilities in the commission of a crime, it has in the
criminal law area expanded the scope of its jurisdiction. Typical of
this expansion is a statute making it a federal offense to “in any
way or degree obstruct . . . delay . . . or affect . . . commerce . . .
by robbery or extortion . . . .” 948 With the expansion of the scope
of the reach of “commerce” the statute potentially could reach crimes
involving practically all business concerns, although it appears to
be used principally against organized crime.

(1876); Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651 (1951).
     943 The Fair Housing Act (Title VIIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), 82 Stat.

73, 81, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq., was based on the Commerce Clause, but, in Jones
v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), the Court held that legislation that
prohibited discrimination in housing could be based on the Thirteenth Amendment
and made operative against private parties. Similarly, the Court has concluded that,
although § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is judicially enforceable only against “state
action,” Congress is not so limited under its enforcement authorization of § 5. United
