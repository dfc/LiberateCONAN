    Typically the Court looks to the entire statute to determine
whether there is an intelligible standard to guide administrators,
and a statute’s declaration of policies or statement of purposes can
provide the necessary guidance. If a statute’s declared policies are
not open-ended, then a delegation of authority to implement those
policies can be upheld. For example, in United States v. Rock Royal
Co-operative, Inc.,111 the Court contrasted the National Industrial
Recovery Act’s statement of policy, “couched in most general terms”
and found lacking in Schechter, with the narrower policy that an
agricultural marketing law directed the Secretary of Agriculture to
implement.112 Similarly, the Court found ascertainable standards in
the Emergency Price Control Act’s conferral of authority to set prices
for commodities if their prices had risen in a manner “inconsistent
with the purposes of this Act.” 113
    The Court has been notably successful in finding standards that
are constitutionally adequate. Standards have been ascertained to
exist in such formulations as “just and reasonable,” 114 “public inter-
est,” 115 “public convenience, interest, or necessity,” 116 “unfair meth-
ods of competition,” 117 and “requisite to protect the public health
[with] an adequate margin of safety.” 118 Thus, in National Broad-
casting Co. v. United States,119 the Court found that the discretion
conferred on the Federal Communications Commission to license broad-
casting stations to promote the “public interest, convenience, or ne-
cessity” conveyed a standard “as complete as the complicated fac-
tors for judgment in such a field of delegated authority permit.” 120
Yet the regulations upheld were directed to the contractual rela-
tions between networks and stations and were designed to reduce
the effect of monopoly in the industry, a policy on which the stat-
ute was silent.121

    112 307 U.S. at 575. Other guidance in the marketing law limited the terms of
implementing orders and specified the covered commodities.
    113 Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944) (the principal purpose was to

control wartime inflation, and the administrator was directed to give “due consider-
ation” to a specified pre-war base period).

(1933).

    121 Similarly, the promulgation by the FCC of rules creating a “fairness doc-

trine” and a “right to reply” rule has been sustained, Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), as well as a rule requiring the carrying of anti-smoking
commercials. Banzhaf v. FCC, 405 F.2d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom.
Tobacco Institute v. FCC, 396 U.S. 842 (1969).
