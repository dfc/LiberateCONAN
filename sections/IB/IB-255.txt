    The power of Congress “to exclude aliens from the United States
and to prescribe the terms and conditions on which they come in”
is absolute, being an attribute of the United States as a sovereign
nation. “That the government of the United States, through the ac-
tion of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its terri-
tory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy.
Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of
every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could
not exclude aliens, it would be to that extent subject to the control
of another power. . . . The United States, in their relation to for-
eign countries and their subjects or citizens, are one nation, in-
vested with powers which belong to independent nations, the exer-
cise of which can be invoked for the maintenance of its absolute
independence and security throughout its entire territory.” 1355

753 (1972). In Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530–531 (1954), Justice Frankfurter
for the Court wrote: “[M]uch could be said for the view, were we writing on a clean
slate, that the Due Process Clause qualifies the scope of political discretion hereto-
fore recognized as belonging to Congress in regulating the entry and deportation of
aliens. . . . But the slate is not clean. As to the extent of the power of Congress
under review, there is not merely ‘a page of history,’ . . . but a whole volume. . . .
[T]hat the formulation of these policies is entrusted exclusively to Congress has be-
come about as firmly imbedded in the legislative and judicial tissues of our body
politic as any aspect of our government.” Although the issue of racial discrimination
was before the Court in Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846 (1985), in the context of parole
for undocumented aliens, the Court avoided it, holding that statutes and regula-
tions precluded INS considerations of race or national origin. Justices Marshall and
Brennan, in dissent, argued for reconsideration of the long line of precedents and
for constitutional restrictions on the government. Id. at 858. That there exists some
limitation upon exclusion of aliens is one permissible interpretation of Reagan v.
Abourezk, 484 U.S. 1 (1987), aff’g by an equally divided Court, 785 F.2d 1043 (D.C.
Cir. 1986), holding that mere membership in the Communist Party could not be used
to exclude an alien on the ground that his activities might be prejudicial to the in-
terests of the United States.
     The power of Congress to prescribe the rules for exclusion or expulsion of aliens
is a “fundamental sovereign attribute” which is “of a political character and there-
fore subject only to narrow judicial review.” Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S.
88, 101 n.21 (1976); Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81–82 (1976); Fiallo v. Bell, 430
U.S. 787, 792 (1977). Although aliens are “an identifiable class of persons,” who aside
from the classification at issue “are already subject to disadvantages not shared by
the remainder of the community,” Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. at 102, Con-
gress may treat them in ways that would violate the Equal Protection Clause if a
state should do it. Diaz (residency requirement for welfare benefits); Fiallo (sex and
illegitimacy classifications). Nonetheless in Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. at 103, the Court
observed that when the Federal Government asserts an overriding national interest
as justification for a discriminatory rule that would violate the Equal Protection Clause
if adopted by a state, due process requires that it be shown that the rule was actu-
