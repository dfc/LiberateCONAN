of Arizona’s law barring the operation within the state of trains of
more than 14 passenger cars (no other state had a figure this low)
or 70 freight cars (only one other state had a cap this low). First,
the Court observed that the law substantially burdened interstate
commerce. Enforcement of the law in Arizona, while train lengths
went unregulated or were regulated by varying standards in other
states, meant that interstate trains of a length lawful in other states
had to be broken up before entering Arizona. As it was not practi-
cable to break up trains at the border, that act had to be done at
yards quite removed, with the result that the Arizona limitation con-
trolled train lengths as far east as El Paso, Texas, and as far west
as Los Angeles. Nearly 95 percent of the rail traffic in Arizona was
interstate. The other alternative was to operate in other states with
the lowest cap, Arizona’s, with the result that Arizona’s law con-
trolled the railroads’ operations over a wide area.1115 If other states
began regulating at different lengths, as they would be permitted
to do, the burden on the railroads would burgeon. Moreover, the
additional number of trains needed to comply with the cap just within
Arizona was costly, and delays were occasioned by the need to break
up and remake lengthy trains.1116
    Conversely, the Court found that, as a safety measure, the state
cap had “at most slight and dubious advantage, if any, over unregu-
lated train lengths.” That is, although there were safety problems
with longer trains, the shorter trains mandated by state law re-
quired increases in the numbers of trains and train operations and
a consequent increase in accidents generally more severe than those
attributable to longer trains. In short, the evidence did not show
that the cap lessened rather than increased the danger of acci-
dents.1117
    Conflicting state regulations appeared in Bibb v. Navajo Freight
Lines.1118 There, Illinois required the use of contour mudguards on
trucks and trailers operating on the state’s highways, while adja-
cent Arkansas required the use of straight mudguards and banned
ingly to the state legislature. Barnwell Bros. involved a state law that prohibited
use on state highways of trucks that were over 90 inches wide or that had a gross
weight over 20,000 pounds, with from 85% to 90% of the Nation’s trucks exceeding
these limits. This deference and refusal to evaluate evidence resurfaced in a case
involving an attack on railroad “full-crew” laws. Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire-
men & Enginemen v. Chicago, R.I. & P. Railroad Co., 393 U.S. 129 (1968).
    1115 The concern about the impact of one state’s regulation upon the laws of other

states is in part a reflection of the Cooley national uniformity interest and partly a
hesitation about the autonomy of other states. E.g., CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America, 481 U.S. 69, 88–89 (1987); Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State
Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 583–84 (1986).
    1116 Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761, 771–75 (1945).
    1117 325 U.S. at 775–79, 781–84.
    1118 359 U.S. 520 (1959).
