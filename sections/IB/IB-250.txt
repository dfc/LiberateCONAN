ral born’ citizen is eligible to be President.” 1324 The failure of the
statute, the Court held, was that it impermissibly distinguished be-
tween native-born and naturalized citizens, denying the latter the
equal protection of the laws.1325 “This statute proceeds on the im-
permissible assumption that naturalized citizens as a class are less
reliable and bear less allegiance to this country than do the native-
born. This is an assumption that is impossible for us to make. . . .
A native-born citizen is free to reside abroad indefinitely without
suffering loss of citizenship. The discrimination aimed at natural-
ized citizens drastically limits their rights to live and work abroad
in a way that other citizens may. It creates indeed a second-class
citizenship. Living abroad, whether the citizen be naturalized or native-
born, is no badge of lack of allegiance and in no way evidences a
voluntary renunciation of nationality and allegiance.” 1326
    The Schneider equal protection rationale was abandoned in the
next case in which the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment
forbade involuntary expatriation of naturalized persons.1327 But in
Rogers v. Bellei,1328 the Court refused to extend this holding to per-
sons statutorily naturalized at birth abroad because one of their par-
ents was a citizen and similarly refused to apply Schneider. Thus,
one who failed to honor a condition subsequent had his citizenship
revoked. “Neither are we persuaded that a condition subsequent in
this area impresses one with ‘second-class citizenship.’ That cliche
is too handy and too easy, and, like most cliches, can be mislead-
ing. That the condition subsequent may be beneficial is apparent
in the light of the conceded fact that citizenship was fully deniable.
The proper emphasis is on what the statute permits him to gain
from the possible starting point of noncitizenship, not on what he
claims to lose from the possible starting point of full citizenship to
which he has no constitutional right in the first place. His citizen-
ship, while it lasts, although conditional, is not ‘second-class.’ ” 1329
    It is not clear where the progression of cases has left us in this
area. Clearly, naturalized citizens are fully entitled to all the rights
and privileges of those who are citizens because of their birth here.

    1325  Although there is no equal protection clause specifically applicable to the
Federal Government, it is established that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-
ment forbids discrimination in much the same manner as the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In fact, “[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amend-
ment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Buckley v. Valeo,
