v. Shaughnessy,1364 an order of the Attorney General excluding, on
the basis of confidential information he would not disclose, a war-
time bride, who was prima facie entitled to enter the United States,1365
was held to be unreviewable by the courts. Nor were regulations
on which the order was based invalid as an undue delegation of
legislative power. “Normally Congress supplies the conditions of the
privilege of entry into the United States. But because the power of
exclusion of aliens is also inherent in the executive department of
the sovereign, Congress may in broad terms authorize the execu-
tive to exercise the power, e.g., as was done here, for the best inter-
ests of the country during a time of national emergency. Executive
officers may be entrusted with the duty of specifying the proce-
dures for carrying out the congressional intent.” 1366 However, when
Congress has spelled out the basis for exclusion or deportation, the
Court remains free to interpret the statute and review the admin-
istration of it and to apply it, often in a manner to mitigate the
effects of the law on aliens.1367
    Congress’s power to admit aliens under whatever conditions it
lays down is exclusive of state regulation. The states “can neither
add to nor take from the conditions lawfully imposed by Congress
upon admission, naturalization and residence of aliens in the United
States or the several states. State laws which impose discrimina-
tory burdens upon the entrance or residence of aliens lawfully within
the United States conflict with this constitutionally derived federal
power to regulate immigration, and have accordingly been held in-
valid.” 1368 This principle, however, has not precluded all state regu-
lations dealing with aliens.1369 The power of Congress to legislate
with respect to the conduct of alien residents is a concomitant of
     1364 338 U.S. 537 (1950). See also Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei,

345 U.S. 206 (1953), in which the Court majority upheld the Government’s power to
exclude on the basis of information it would not disclose a permanent resident who
had gone abroad for about nineteen months and was seeking to return on a new
visa. But the Court will frequently read the applicable statutes and regulations strictly
against the government for the benefit of persons sought to be excluded. Cf. Delgadillo
