         on the high seas, and crimes of every grade committed on them while
         in foreign territorial waters.” 1570 Within the meaning of this sec-
         tion, an offense is committed on the high seas even when the ves-
         sel on which it occurs is lying at anchor on the road in the territo-
         rial waters of another country.1571

                                      THE WAR POWER

         Source and Scope
             Three Theories.—Three different views regarding the source
         of the war power found expression in the early years of the Consti-
         tution and continued to vie for supremacy for nearly a century and
         a half. Writing in The Federalist,1572 Hamilton elaborated the theory
         that the war power is an aggregate of the particular powers granted
         by Article I, § 8. Not many years later, in 1795, the argument was
         advanced that the war power of the National Government is an at-
         tribute of sovereignty and hence not dependent upon the affirma-
         tive grants of the written Constitution.1573 Chief Justice Marshall
         appears to have taken a still different view, namely that the power
         to wage war is implied from the power to declare it. In McCulloch
         v. Maryland,1574 he listed the power “to declare and conduct a war” 1575
         as one of the “enumerated powers” from which the authority to char-
         ter the Bank of the United States was deduced. During the era of
         the Civil War, the two latter theories were both given countenance
         by the Supreme Court. Speaking for four Justices in Ex parte Mil-
            1570 United States v. Flores, 289 U.S. 137, 149–50 (1933).
            1571 United States v. Furlong, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 184, 200 (1820).
            1572 THE FEDERALIST, No. 23 (J. Cooke ed. 1937), 146–51.
            1573 Penhallow v. Doane, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 53 (1795).
            1574 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819).
            1575 17 U.S. at 407. (emphasis supplied).
