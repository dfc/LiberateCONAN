not bar all legislative restrictions of the rights guaranteed by it.257
“[T]he protections of the First Amendment, unlike a proper claim
of the privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amend-
ment, do not afford a witness the right to resist inquiry in all cir-
cumstances. Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar gov-
ernmental interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a
balancing by the courts of the competing private and public inter-
ests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.” 258
    Thus, the Court has declined to rule that under the circum-
stances of the cases investigating committees are precluded from
making inquiries simply because the subject area was education 259
or because the witnesses at the time they were called were en-
gaged in protected activities such as petitioning Congress to abol-
ish the inquiring committee.260 However, in an earlier case, the Court
intimated that it was taking a narrow view of the committee’s au-
thority because a determination that authority existed would raise
a serious First Amendment issue.261 And in a state legislative inves-
tigating committee case, the majority of the Court held that an in-
quiry seeking the membership lists of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People was so lacking in a “nexus” be-
tween the organization and the Communist Party that the inquiry
infringed the First Amendment.262
    Dicta in the Court’s opinions acknowledge that the Fourth Amend-
ment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures are
applicable to congressional committees.263 The issue would most of-
ten arise in the context of subpoenas, inasmuch as that procedure
is the usual way by which committees obtain documentary mate-
rial and inasmuch as Fourth Amendment standards apply to sub-

    257 The matter is discussed fully in the section on the First Amendment but a

good statement of the balancing rule may be found in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S.
37, 51 (1971), by Justice Black, supposedly an absolutist on the subject: “Where a
statute does not directly abridge free speech, but—while regulating a subject within
the State’s power—tends to have the incidental effect of inhibiting First Amend-
ment rights, it is well settled that the statute can be upheld if the effect on speech
is minor in relation to the need for control of the conduct and the lack of alternative
means for doing so.”
