power to impose criminal penalties, described below, further illus-
trate the difference between delegating the underlying power to set
basic policy—whether it be the decision to impose taxes or the de-
cision to declare that certain activities are crimes—and the author-
ity to exercise discretion in implementing the policy.
     Crime and Punishment.—The Court has confessed that its
“cases are not entirely clear as to whether more specific guidance
is in fact required” for delegations relating to the imposition of crimi-
nal sanctions.175 It is clear, however, that some essence of the power
to define crimes and set a range of punishments is not delegable,
but must be exercised by Congress. This conclusion derives in part
from the time-honored principle that penal statutes are to be strictly
construed, and that no one should be “subjected to a penalty un-
less the words of the statute plainly impose it.” 176 Both Schechter 177
and Panama Refining 178—the only two cases in which the Court
has invalidated delegations—involved broad delegations of power to
“make federal crimes of acts that never had been such before.” 179
Thus, Congress must provide by statute that violation of the stat-
ute’s terms—or of valid regulations issued pursuant thereto—shall
constitute a crime, and the statute must also specify a permissible
range of penalties. Punishment in addition to that authorized in
the statute may not be imposed by administrative action.180
     However, once Congress has exercised its power to declare cer-
tain acts criminal, and has set a range of punishment for viola-
tions, authority to flesh out the details may be delegated. Congress
may provide that violation of valid administrative regulations shall
be punished as a crime.181 For example, the Court has upheld a
delegation of authority to classify drugs as “controlled substances,”
    175  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 166 (1991).
    176  Tiffany v. National Bank of Missouri, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 409, 410 (1873).
     177 A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935).
     178 Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935).
     179 Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 249 (1947).
     180 L. P. Steuart & Bro. v. Bowles, 322 U.S. 398, 404 (1944) (“[I]t is for Congress

to prescribe the penalties for the laws which it writes. It would transcend both the
judicial and the administrative function to make additions to those which Congress
has placed behind a statute”).
     181 United States v. Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506 (1911). The Forest Reserve Act at

issue in Grimaud clearly provided for punishment for violation of “rules and regula-
tions of the Secretary.” The Court in Grimaud distinguished United States v. Eaton,
144 U.S. 677 (1892), which had held that authority to punish for violation of a regu-
lation was lacking in more general language authorizing punishment for failure to
do what was “required by law.” 220 U.S. at 519. Extension of the principle that pe-
nal statutes should be strictly construed requires that the prohibited acts be clearly
identified in the regulation. M. Kraus & Bros. v. United States, 327 U.S. 614, 621
(1946). The Court summarized these cases in Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748
(1996), drawing the conclusion that “there is no absolute rule . . . against Con-
gress’s delegation of authority to define criminal punishments.”
