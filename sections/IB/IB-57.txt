that as nearly as is practicable one man’s vote in a congressional
election is to be worth as much as another’s.” 282
    Court involvement in this issue developed slowly. In our early
history, state congressional delegations were generally elected at-
large instead of by districts, and even when Congress required single-
member districting 283 and later added a provision for equally popu-
lated districts 284 the relief sought by voters was action by the House
refusing to seat Members-elect selected under systems not in com-
pliance with the federal laws.285 The first series of cases did not
reach the Supreme Court, in fact, until the states began redistrict-
ing through the 1930 Census, and these were resolved without reach-
ing constitutional issues and indeed without resolving the issue
whether such voter complaints were justiciable at all.286 In the late
1940s and the early 1950s, the Court used the “political question”
doctrine to decline to adjudicate districting and apportionment suits,
a position changed in Baker v. Carr.287
    For the Court in Wesberry,288 Justice Black argued that a read-
ing of the debates of the Constitutional Convention conclusively dem-
onstrated that the Framers had meant, in using the phrase “by the
People,” to guarantee equality of representation in the election of
Members of the House of Representatives.289 Justice Harlan in dis-
sent argued that the statements on which the majority relied had
uniformly been in the context of the Great Compromise—Senate rep-
resentation of the states with Members elected by the state legisla-
tures, House representation according to the population of the states,
qualified by the guarantee of at least one Member per state and
the counting of slaves as three-fifths of persons—and not at all in
the context of intrastate districting. Further, he thought the Con-
vention debates clear to the effect that Article I, § 4, had vested
exclusive control over state districting practices in Congress, and
that the Court action overrode a congressional decision not to re-
quire equally populated districts.290
