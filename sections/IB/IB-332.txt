statute as merely expressing in shorthand the characteristics of those
persons who were likely to utilize union responsibilities to accom-
plish harmful acts; Congress could validly conclude that all mem-
bers of the Communist Party possessed those characteristics.1893
     The majority’s decision in Brown cast in doubt certain statutes
and certain statutory formulations that had been held not to consti-
tute bills of attainder. For example, a predecessor of the statute struck
down in Brown, which had conditioned a union’s access to the NLRB
upon the filing of affidavits by all of the union’s officers attesting
that they were not members of or affiliated with the Communist
Party, had been upheld,1894 and although Chief Justice Warren dis-
tinguished the previous case from Brown on the basis that the Court
in the previous decision had found the statute to be preventive rather
than punitive,1895 he then proceeded to reject the contention that
the punishment necessary for a bill of attainder had to be punitive
or retributive rather than preventive,1896 thus undermining the prior
decision. Of much greater significance was the effect of the Brown
decision on “conflict-of-interest” legislation typified by that upheld
in Board of Governors v. Agnew.1897 The statute there forbade any
partner or employee of a firm primarily engaged in underwriting
securities from being a director of a national bank.1898 Chief Jus-
tice Warren distinguished the prior decision and the statute on three
grounds from the statute then under consideration. First, the union
statute inflicted its deprivation upon the members of a suspect po-
litical group in typical bill-of-attainder fashion, unlike the statute
in Agnew. Second, in the Agnew statute, Congress did not express
a judgment upon certain men or members of a particular group; it
rather concluded that any man placed in the two positions would
suffer a temptation any man might yield to. Third, Congress estab-
lished in the Agnew statute an objective standard of conduct ex-
pressed in shorthand which precluded persons from holding the two
positions.
    Apparently withdrawing from the Brown analysis in upholding
a statute providing for governmental custody of documents and re-

389 U.S. 258 (1967), a very similar statute making it unlawful for any member of a
“Communist-action organization” to be employed in a defense facility was struck down
on First Amendment grounds and the bill of attainder argument was ignored.
