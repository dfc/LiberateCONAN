their officers.2170 But where a municipal organization has ceased prac-
tically to exist through the vacation of its offices, and the govern-
ment’s function is exercised once more by the state directly, the Court
has thus far found itself powerless to frustrate a program of repu-
diation.2171 However, there is no reason why the state should enact
the role of particeps criminis in an attempt to relieve its municipali-
ties of the obligation to meet their honest debts. Thus, in 1931, dur-
ing the Great Depression, New Jersey created a Municipal Finance
Commission with power to assume control over its insolvent munici-
palities. To the complaint of certain bondholders that this legisla-
tion impaired the contract obligations of their debtors, the Court,
speaking by Justice Frankfurter, pointed out that the practical value
of an unsecured claim against a city is “the effectiveness of the city’s
taxing power,” which the legislation under review was designed to
conserve.2172
     Private Contracts and the Police Power.—The increasing sub-
jection of public grants to the police power of the states has been
previously pointed out. That purely private contracts should be in
any stronger situation in this respect obviously would be anoma-
lous in the extreme. In point of fact, the ability of private parties
to curtail governmental authority by the easy device of contracting
with one another is, with an exception to be noted, even less than
that of the state to tie its own hands by contracting away its own
powers. So, when it was contended in an early Pennsylvania case
that an act prohibiting the issuance of notes by unincorporated bank-
ing associations violated the Contract Clause because of its effect
upon certain existing contracts of members of such association, the
state Supreme Court answered: “But it is said, that the members
had formed a contract between themselves, which would be dis-
solved by the stoppage of their business. And what then? Is that
such a violation of contracts as is prohibited by the Constitution of
the United States? Consider to what such a construction would lead.
Let us suppose, that in one of the States there is no law against

    2171  Heine v. Levee Commissioners, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 655 (1874). Cf. Virginia v.
West Virginia, 246 U.S. 565 (1918).
     2172 Faitoute Co. v. City of Asbury Park, 316 U.S. 502, 510 (1942). Alluding to

the ineffectiveness of purely judicial remedies against defaulting municipalities, Jus-
tice Frankfurter says: “For there is no remedy when resort is had to ‘devices and
contrivances’ to nullify the taxing power which can be carried out only through au-
thorized officials. See Rees v. City of Watertown, 19 Wall. [86 U.S.] 107, 124 [1874].
And so we have had the spectacle of taxing officials resigning from office in order to
frustrate tax levies through mandamus, and officials running on a platform of will-
ingness to go to jail rather than to enforce a tax levy (see Raymond, State and Mu-
nicipal Bonds, 342–343), and evasion of service by tax collectors, thus making impo-
tent a court’s mandate. Yost v. Dallas County, 236 U.S. 50, 57 [1915].” Id. at 511.
