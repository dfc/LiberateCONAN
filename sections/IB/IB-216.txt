has failed to make. In making this determination, the Court’s evalu-
ation of the desirability of overlapping regulatory schemes or over-
lapping criminal sanctions cannot but be a substantial factor.” 1149
     Preemption Standards.—Until roughly the New Deal, as re-
cited above, the Supreme Court applied a doctrine of “dual federal-
ism,” under which the Federal Government and the states were sepa-
rate sovereigns, each preeminent in its own fields but lacking authority
in the other’s. This conception affected preemption cases, with the
Court taking the view, largely, that any congressional regulation of
a subject effectively preempted the field and ousted the states.1150
Thus, when Congress entered the field of railroad regulation, the
result was invalidation of many previously enacted state measures.
Even here, however, safety measures tended to survive, and health
and safety legislation in other areas was protected from the effects
of federal regulatory actions.
    In the 1940s, the Court began to develop modern standards, still
recited and relied on, for determining when preemption oc-
curred.1151 All modern cases recite some variation of the basic stan-
dards. “[T]he question whether a certain state action is pre-empted
by federal law is one of congressional intent. The purpose of Con-
gress is the ultimate touchstone. To discern Congress’s intent we
examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and pur-
pose of the statute.” 1152 Congress’s intent to supplant state author-
ity in a particular field may be “explicitly stated in the statute’s

U. CHI. L. REV. 85, 87–88 (1956). “The [Court] appears to use essentially the same
reasoning process in a case nominally hinging on preemption as it has in past cases
in which the question was whether the state law regulated or burdened interstate
commerce. [The] Court has adopted the same weighing of interests approach in pre-
emption cases that it uses to determine whether a state law unjustifiably burdens
interstate commerce. In a number of situations the Court has invalidated statutes
on the preemption ground when it appeared that the state laws sought to favor lo-
cal economic interests at the expense of the interstate market. On the other hand,
when the Court has been satisfied that valid local interests, such as those in safety
or in the reputable operation of local business, outweigh the restrictive effect on in-
terstate commerce, the Court has rejected the preemption argument and allowed
state regulation to stand.” Note, Preemption as a Preferential Ground: A New Canon
