ticles exported from any State may not be taxed at all. Direct taxes
must be levied by the rule of apportionment and indirect taxes by
the rule of uniformity. The Court has emphasized the sweeping char-
acter of this power by saying from time to time that it “reaches
every subject,” 530 that it is “exhaustive” 531 or that it “embraces ev-
ery conceivable power of taxation.” 532 Despite these generaliza-
tions, the power has been at times substantially curtailed by judi-
cial decision with respect to the subject matter of taxation, the manner
in which taxes are imposed, and the objects for which they may be
levied.
    Decline of the Forbidden Subject Matter Test.—The Su-
preme Court has restored to Congress the power to tax most of the
subject matter which had previously been withdrawn from its reach
by judicial decision. The holding of Evans v. Gore 533 and Miles v.
Graham 534 that the inclusion of the salaries received by federal judges
in measuring the liability for a nondiscriminatory income tax vio-
lated the constitutional mandate that the compensation of such judges
should not be diminished during their continuance in office was re-
pudiated in O’Malley v. Woodrough.535 The specific ruling of Collec-
tor v. Day 536 that the salary of a state officer is immune to federal
income taxation also has been overruled.537 But the principle under-

was decided in 1871 while the country was still in the throes of Reconstruction. As
noted by Chief Justice Stone in a footnote to his opinion in Helvering v. Gerhardt,
304 U.S. 405, 414 n.4 (1938), the Court had not determined how far the Civil War
Amendments had broadened the federal power at the expense of the states, but the
fact that the taxing power had recently been used with destructive effect upon notes
issued by the state banks, Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 533 (1869), sug-
gested the possibility of similar attacks upon the existence of the states themselves.
Two years later, the Court took the logical step of holding that the federal income
tax could not be imposed on income received by a municipal corporation from its
investments. United States v. Railroad Co., 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 322 (1873). A far-
reaching extension of private immunity was granted in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &
Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429 (1895), where interest received by a private investor on state
or municipal bonds was held to be exempt from federal taxation. (Though relegated
to virtual desuetude, Pollock was not expressly overruled until South Carolina v.
Baker, 485 U.S. 505 (1988)). As the apprehension of this era subsided, the doctrine
of these cases was pushed into the background. It never received the same wide
application as did McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), in curbing
the power of the states to tax operations or instrumentalities of the Federal Govern-
ment. Only once since the turn of the century has the national taxing power been
further narrowed in the name of dual federalism. In 1931 the Court held that a
federal excise tax was inapplicable to the manufacture and sale to a municipal cor-
