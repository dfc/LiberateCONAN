both taxes alike in all respects.1050 In Complete Auto Transit, Inc.
v. Brady,1051 the Court overruled the cases embodying the distinc-
tion and articulated a standard that has governed the cases since.
The tax in Brady was imposed on the privilege of doing business
as applied to a corporation engaged in interstate transportation ser-
vices in the taxing state; it was measured by the corporation’s gross
receipts from the service. The appropriate concern, the Court wrote,
was to pay attention to “economic realities” and to “address the prob-
lems with which the commerce clause is concerned.” 1052 The stan-
dard, a set of four factors that was distilled from precedent but newly
applied, was firmly set out. A tax on interstate commerce will be
sustained “when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial
nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discrimi-
nate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the ser-
vices provided by the State.” 1053 All subsequent cases have been de-
cided in this framework.
    Nexus.—“The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause im-
pose distinct but parallel limitations on a State’s power to tax out-
of-state activities. The Due Process Clause demands that there ex-
ist some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state
and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax, as well as a
rational relationship between the tax and the values connected with
the taxing State. The Commerce Clause forbids the States to levy
taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce or that bur-
den it by subjecting activities to multiple or unfairly apportioned
taxation.” 1054 “The broad inquiry subsumed in both constitutional
requirements is whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears

ated nature of the purported distinction was evidenced in Colonial Pipeline Co. v.
Traigle, 421 U.S. 100 (1975), in which the Court sustained a nondiscriminatory, fairly
apportioned franchise tax that was measured by the taxpayer’s capital stock, im-
posed on a pipeline company doing an exclusively interstate business in the taxing
state, on the basis that it was a tax imposed on the privilege of conducting business
in the corporate form.

taxes, our goal has instead been to ‘establish a consistent and rational method of
inquiry’ focusing on ‘the practical effect of a challenged tax.’ ” Commonwealth Edison
