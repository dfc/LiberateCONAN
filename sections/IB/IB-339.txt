cause of its ownership, but a true excise levied on the results of
the business of carrying on mining operations.” 1945
    A convincing demonstration of the extent to which the Pollock
decision had been whittled down by the time the Sixteenth Amend-
ment was adopted is found in Billings v. United States.1946 In chal-
lenging an annual tax assessed for the year 1909 on the use of for-
eign built yachts—a levy not distinguishable in substance from the
carriage tax involved in the Hylton case as construed by the Su-
preme Court—counsel did not even suggest that the tax should be
classed as a direct tax. Instead, he based his argument that the
exaction constituted a taking of property without due process of law
upon the premise that it was an excise, and the Supreme Court
disposed of the case upon the same assumption.
    In 1921, the Court cast aside the distinction drawn in Knowlton
v. Moore between the right to transmit property on the one hand
and the privilege of receiving it on the other, and sustained an es-
tate tax as an excise. “Upon this point,” wrote Justice Holmes for a
unanimous Court, “a page of history is worth a volume of logic.” 1947
Having established this proposition, the Court had no difficulty in
deciding that the inclusion in the computation of the estate tax of
property held as joint tenants,1948 or as tenants by the entirety,1949
or the entire value of community property owned by husband and
wife,1950 or the proceeds of insurance upon the life of the dece-
dent,1951 did not amount to direct taxation of such property. Simi-
larly, it upheld a graduated tax on gifts as an excise, saying that it
was “a tax laid only upon the exercise of a single one of those pow-
ers incident to ownership, the power to give the property owned to
another.” 1952 Justice Sutherland, speaking for himself and two as-
sociates, urged that “the right to give away one’s property is as fun-
damental as the right to sell it or, indeed, to possess it.” 1953
