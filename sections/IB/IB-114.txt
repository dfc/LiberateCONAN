subserved by the tax in its normal operation,” 619 because state un-
employment compensation payments would relieve the burden for
direct relief borne by the national treasury. The Court reserved judg-
ment as to the validity of a tax “if it is laid upon the condition that
a state may escape its operation through the adoption of a statute
unrelated in subject matter to activities fairly within the scope of
national policy and power.” 620
     Conditional Grants-in-Aid.—It was not until 1947 that the
right of Congress to impose conditions upon grants-in-aid over the
objection of a state was squarely presented.621 The Court upheld
Congress’s power to do so in Oklahoma v. Civil Service Commis-
sion.622 The state objected to the enforcement of a provision of the
Hatch Act that reduced its allotment of federal highway funds be-
cause of its failure to remove from office a member of the State High-
way Commission found to have taken an active part in party poli-
tics while in office. The Court denied relief on the ground that, “[w]hile
the United States is not concerned with, and has no power to regu-
late local political activities as such of state officials, it does have
power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to states
shall be disbursed. . . . The end sought by Congress through the
Hatch Act is better public service by requiring those who adminis-
ter funds for national needs to abstain from active political parti-
sanship. So even though the action taken by Congress does have
effect upon certain activities within the state, it has never been thought
that such effect made the federal act invalid.” 623
    The general principle is firmly established. “Congress has fre-
quently employed the Spending Power to further broad policy objec-
tives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by
the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.
This Court has repeatedly upheld against constitutional challenge


    619  301 U.S. at 586, 591.
    620   301 U.S. at 590. See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 90–92 (1976); Fullilove
v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 473–475 (1980); Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halder-
man, 451 U.S. 1 (1981).
     621 In Steward Machine Company v. Davis, it was a taxpayer who complained

of the invasion of state sovereignty, and the Court put great emphasis on the fact
that the state was a willing partner in the plan of cooperation embodied in the So-
cial Security Act. 301 U.S. 548, 589, 590 (1937).
     622 330 U.S. 127 (1947).
     623 330 U.S. 127, 143 (1947). This is not to say that Congress may police the

effectiveness of its spending only by means of attaching conditions to grants; Con-
gress may also rely on criminal sanctions to penalize graft and corruption that may
impede its purposes in spending programs. Sabri v. United States, 541 U.S. 600 (2004).
