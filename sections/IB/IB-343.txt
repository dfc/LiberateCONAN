       the power that the First Congress had exercised 1975 in sanctioning

    Clause 7. No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but
in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular
Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all
public Money shall be published from time to time.
                                 APPROPRIATIONS
           The restriction on drawing money from the Treasury “was in-
       tended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the Execu-
       tive department,” and “means simply that no money can be paid
       out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of
       Congress.” 1977 Congress may recognize and pay a claim of an equi-
       table, moral, or honorary nature. When it directs a specific sum to
       be paid to a certain person, neither the Secretary of the Treasury
       nor any court has discretion to determine whether the person is
       entitled to receive it.1978 In making appropriations to pay claims
       arising out of the Civil War, Congress could, the Court held, pro-
       vide that certain persons, i.e., those who had participated in the
       rebellion, should not be paid out of the funds made available by
       the general appropriation, but that such persons should seek relief
       from Congress.1979
           The Court has also recognized that Congress has wide discre-
       tion with regard to the extent to which it may prescribe details of
       expenditures for which it appropriates funds, and has approved the
       frequent practice of making “lump sum” appropriations, i.e., gen-
       eral appropriations of large amounts to be allotted and expended
       as directed by designated government agencies. As an example, the
       Court cited the act of June 17, 1902,1980 “where all moneys re-
       ceived from the sale and disposal of public lands in a large number
       of states and territories [were] set aside as a special fund to be ex-
       pended for the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands within those
       states and territories,” and “[t]he expenditures [were] to be made
       under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior upon such proj-
       ects as he determined to be practicable and advisable.” The Court
