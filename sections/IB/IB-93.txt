tends beyond the date of the final adjournment of Congress.487 His
duty in case of approval of a measure is merely to sign it. He need
not write on the bill the word “approved” nor the date. If no date
appears on the face of the roll, the Court may ascertain the fact by
resort to any source of information capable of furnishing a satisfac-
tory answer.488 A bill becomes a law on the date of its approval by
the President.489 When no time is fixed by the act it is effective from
the date of its approval,490 which usually is taken to be the first
moment of the day, fractions of a day being disregarded.491

The Veto Power
     The veto provisions, the Supreme Court has told us, serve two
functions. On the one hand, they ensure that “the President shall
have suitable opportunity to consider the bills presented to him. . . .
It is to safeguard the President’s opportunity that Paragraph 2 of
§ 7 of Article I provides that bills which he does not approve shall
not become law if the adjournment of the Congress prevents their
return.” 492 At the same time, the sections ensure “that the Con-
gress shall have suitable opportunity to consider his objections to
bills and on such consideration to pass them over his veto provided
there are the requisite votes.” 493 The Court asserted that “[w]e should
not adopt a construction which would frustrate either of these pur-
poses.” 494
     In one major respect, however, the President’s actual desires may
be frustrated by the presentation to him of omnibus bills or of bills
containing extraneous riders. During the 1980s, on several occa-
sions, Congress lumped all the appropriations for the operation of
the government into one gargantuan bill. But the President must
sign or veto the entire bill; doing the former may mean he has to
accept provisions he would not sign standing alone, and doing the
latter may have other adverse consequences. Numerous Presidents
from Grant on have unsuccessfully sought by constitutional amend-
ment a “line-item veto” by which individual items in an appropria-
tions bill or a substantive bill could be extracted and vetoed. More
recently, beginning in the FDR Administration, it has been debated
     487 Edwards v. United States, 286 U.S. 482 (1932). On one occasion in 1936, de-

lay in presentation of a bill enabled the President to sign it 23 days after the ad-
journment of Congress. Schmeckebier, Approval of Bills After Adjournment of Con-
