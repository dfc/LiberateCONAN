gressional power to expose for the sake of exposure.” 222 Although
some Justices, always in dissent, have attempted to assert limita-
tions in practice based upon this concept, the majority of Justices
have adhered to the traditional precept that courts will not inquire
into legislators’ motives but will look 223 only to the question of power.224
“So long as Congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power,
the Judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the mo-
tives which spurred the exercise of that power.” 225
     Protection of Witnesses; Pertinency and Related Mat-
ters.—A witness appearing before a congressional committee is en-
titled to require of the committee a demonstration of its authority
to inquire into his activities and a showing that the questions asked
of him are pertinent to the committee’s area of inquiry. A congres-
sional committee possesses only those powers delegated to it by its
parent body. The enabling resolution that has given it life also con-
tains the grant and limitations of the committee’s power.226 In Watkins
v. United States,227 Chief Justice Warren cautioned that “[b]roadly

     222 Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 200 (1957). The Chief Justice, how-

ever, noted: “We are not concerned with the power of the Congress to inquire into
and publicize corruption, maladministration or inefficiency in agencies of the Govern-
ment. That was the only kind of activity described by Woodrow Wilson in Congres-
sional Government when he wrote: ‘The informing function of Congress should be
preferred even to its legislative function.’ Id. at 303. From the earliest times in its
history, the Congress has assiduously performed an ‘informing function’ of this na-
ture.” Id. at 200 n.33.
     In his book, Wilson continued, following the sentence quoted by the Chief Jus-
tice: “The argument is not only that discussed and interrogated administration is
the only pure and efficient administration, but, more than that, that the only really
self-governing people is that people which discusses and interrogates its administra-
tion. . . . It would be hard to conceive of there being too much talk about the prac-
tical concerns . . . of government.” CONGRESSIONAL GOVERNMENT (1885), 303–304. For
contrasting views of the reach of this statement, compare United States v. Rumely,
345 U.S. 41, 43 (1953), with Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 777–778 (1962)
(Justice Douglas dissenting).
     223 Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 153–162, 166 (1959); Wilkinson v.

United States, 365 U.S. 399, 415, 423 (1961); Braden v. United States, 365 U.S. 431,
446 (1961); but see DeGregory v. Attorney General of New Hampshire, 383 U.S. 825
(1966) (a state investigative case).
     224 “Legislative committees have been charged with losing sight of their duty of

disinterestedness. In times of political passion, dishonest or vindicative motives are
readily attributable to legislative conduct and as readily believed. Courts are not
the place for such controversies.” Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 377–378 (1951).
For a statement of the traditional unwillingness to inquire into congressional mo-
tives in the judging of legislation, see United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 382–
386 (1968). But note that in Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411 (1969), in which
the legislation establishing a state crime investigating commission clearly autho-
rized the commission to designate individuals as law violators, due process was vio-
lated by denying witnesses the rights existing in adversary criminal proceedings.
