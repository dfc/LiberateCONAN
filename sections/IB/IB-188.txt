upon gross receipts of all railroads chartered by the state, part of
the receipts having been derived from interstate transportation of
the same freight that had been held immune from tax in the first
case. If the latter tax were regarded as a tax on interstate com-
merce, it too would fall. But to the Court, the tax on gross receipts
of an interstate transportation company was not a tax on com-
merce. “[I]t is not everything that affects commerce that amounts
to a regulation of it, within the meaning of the Constitution.” 1011 A
gross receipts tax upon a railroad company, which concededly af-
fected commerce, was not a regulation “directly. Very manifestly it
is a tax upon the railroad company. . . . That its ultimate effect may
be to increase the cost of transportation must be admitted. . . . Still
it is not a tax upon transportation, or upon commerce. . . .” 1012
     Insofar as it drew a distinction between these two cases, the
Court did so in part on the basis of Cooley, that some subjects em-
braced within the meaning of commerce demand uniform, national
regulation, whereas other similar subjects permit of diversity of treat-
ment, until Congress acts; and in part on the basis of a concept of
a “direct” tax on interstate commerce, which was impermissible, and
an “indirect” tax, which was permissible until Congress acted.1013
Confusingly, the two concepts were sometimes conflated and some-
times treated separately. In any event, the Court itself was clear
that interstate commerce could not be taxed at all, even if the tax
was a nondiscriminatory levy applied alike to local commerce.1014
“Thus, the States cannot tax interstate commerce, either by laying
the tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the
privilege of engaging in it, or upon the receipts, as such, derived
from it . . . ; or upon persons or property in transit in interstate
commerce.” 1015 However, some taxes imposed only an “indirect” bur-
den and were sustained; property taxes and taxes in lieu of prop-
erty taxes applied to all businesses, including instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, were sustained.1016 A good rule of thumb in
these cases is that taxation was sustained if the tax was imposed
    1011 82 U.S. at 293.
    1012 82 U.S. at 294. This case was overruled 14 years later, when the Court voided
substantially the same tax in Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U.S.
326 (1887).
