       between the individual thus commissioned and the government which
       in this way accredits him as its representative,” which is prohib-
       ited by this clause of the Constitution.1987

    SECTION 10. Clause 1. No State shall enter into any Treaty,
Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Repri-
sal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold
and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of
Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation
of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
       Treaties, Alliances, or Confederations
            At the time of the Civil War, the Court relied on the prohibi-
       tion on treaties, alliances, or confederations in holding that the Con-
       federation formed by the seceding states could not be recognized as
       having any legal existence.1988 Today, the prohibition’s practical sig-
       nificance lies in the limitations that it implies upon the power of
       the states to deal with matters having a bearing upon interna-
       tional relations.
            In the early case of Holmes v. Jennison,1989 Chief Justice Taney
       invoked it as a reason for holding that a state had no power to de-
       liver up a fugitive from justice to a foreign state. More recently,
       the kindred idea that the responsibility for the conduct of foreign
       relations rests exclusively with the Federal Government prompted
       the Court to hold that, because the oil under the three-mile mar-
       ginal belt along the California coast might well become the subject
       of international dispute, and because the ocean, including this three-
       mile belt, is of vital consequence to the nation in its desire to en-
       gage in commerce and to live in peace with the world, the Federal
       Government has paramount rights in and power over that belt, in-
       cluding full dominion over the resources of the soil under the wa-
       ter area.1990 In Skiriotes v. Florida,1991 the Court, on the other hand,
       ruled that this clause did not disable Florida from regulating the
       manner in which its own citizens may engage in sponge fishing out-
       side its territorial waters. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Chief
       Justice Hughes declared, “When its action does not conflict with fed-
       eral legislation, the sovereign authority of the State over the con-
