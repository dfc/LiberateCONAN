Conscription
    The constitutions adopted during the Revolutionary War by at
least nine of the States sanctioned compulsory military service.1614
Towards the end of the War of 1812, conscription of men for the
army was proposed by James Monroe, then Secretary of War, but
opposition developed and peace came before the bill could be en-
acted.1615 In 1863, a compulsory draft law was adopted and put into
operation without being challenged in the federal courts.1616 Not so
the Selective Service Act of 1917.1617 This measure was attacked
on the grounds that it tended to deprive the States of the right to
“a well-regulated militia,” that the only power of Congress to exact
compulsory service was the power to provide for calling forth the
militia for the three purposes specified in the Constitution, which
did not comprehend service abroad, and finally that the compul-
sory draft imposed involuntary servitude in violation of the Thir-
teenth Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected all of these conten-
tions. It held that the powers of the States with respect to the militia
were exercised in subordination to the paramount power of the Na-
tional Government to raise and support armies, and that the power
of Congress to mobilize an army was distinct from its authority to
provide for calling the militia and was not qualified or in any wise
limited thereby.1618
    Before the United States entered the first World War, the Court
had anticipated the objection that compulsory military service would
violate the Thirteenth Amendment and had answered it in the fol-
lowing words: “It introduced no novel doctrine with respect of ser-
vices always treated as exceptional, and certainly was not intended
to interdict enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to
the State, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.
The great purpose in view was liberty under the protection of effec-
tive government, not the destruction of the latter by depriving it of
