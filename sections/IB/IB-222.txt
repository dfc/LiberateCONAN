the requirement of any “statement” relating to smoking health, other
than what the federal law imposed, and the 1969 provision barred
the imposition of any “requirement or prohibition based on smok-
ing and health” by any “State law.” It was, thus, a fair question
whether common-law claims, based on design defect, failure to warn,
breach of express warranty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and con-
spiracy to defraud, were preempted or whether only positive state
enactments came within the scope of the clauses. Two groups of Jus-
tices concluded that the 1965 section reached only positive state law
and did not preempt common-law actions; 1173 different alignments
of Justices concluded that the 1969 provisions did reach common-
law claims, as well as positive enactments, and did preempt some
of the claims insofar as they in fact constituted a requirement or
prohibition based on smoking health.1174
    Little clarification of the confusing Cipollone decision and opin-
ions resulted in the cases following, although it does seem evident
that the attempted distinction limiting courts to the particular lan-
guage of preemption when Congress has spoken has not prevailed.
At issue in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr 1175 was the Medical Device Amend-
ments (MDA) of 1976, which prohibited states from adopting or con-
tinuing in effect “with respect to a [medical] device” any “require-
ment” that is “different from, or in addition to” the applicable federal
requirement and that relates to the safety or effectiveness of the
device.1176 The issue was whether a common-law tort obligation im-
posed a “requirement” that was different from or in addition to any
federal requirement. The device, a pacemaker lead, had come on
the market not pursuant to the rigorous FDA test but rather as

intend to go beyond that reach, so that field and conflict preemption will not be found.
Id. at 517; and id. at 532–33 (Justice Blackmun concurring and dissenting). Both
parts of this canon are departures from established law. Narrow construction when
state police powers are involved has hitherto related to implied preemption, not ex-
press preemption, and courts generally have applied ordinary-meaning construction
to such statutory language; further, courts have not precluded the finding of conflict
preemption, though perhaps field preemption, because of the existence of some ex-
press preemptive language. See id. at 546–48 (Justice Scalia concurring and dissent-
ing).

ring and dissenting), 548–50 (Justice Scalia concurring and dissenting).

ing negligence for operating a train at excessive speed is preempted, but a second
