that role. Wheaton charged Peters with having infringed his copy-
right in the twelve volumes of “Wheaton’s Reports” by reprinting
material from Wheaton’s first volume in “a volume called ‘Con-
densed Reports of Cases in the Supreme Court of the United
States’ ”; 1524 Wheaton based his claim on both common law and a
1790 act of Congress. On the statutory claim, the Court remanded
to the trial court for a determination of whether Wheaton had com-
plied with all the requirements of the act.1525 On the common law
claim, the Court held for Peters, finding that, under common law,
publication divests an author of copyright protection.1526 Wheaton
argued that the Constitution should be held to protect his common
law copyright, because “the word secure . . . clearly indicates an in-
tention, not to originate a right, but to protect one already in exis-
tence.” 1527 The Court found, however, that “the word secure, as used
in the constitution, could not mean the protection of an acknowl-
edged legal right,” but was used “in reference to a future right.” 1528
Thus, the exclusive right that the Constitution authorizes Con-
gress to “secure” to authors and inventors owes its existence solely
to acts of Congress that secure it, from which it follows that the
rights granted by a patent or copyright are subject to such qualifi-
cations and limitations as Congress sees fit to impose. The Court’s
“reluctance to expand [copyright] protection without explicit legisla-
tive guidance” controlled its decision in Sony Corp. v. Universal City
Studios,1529 which held that the manufacture and sale of video tape
(or cassette) recorders for home use do not constitute “contribu-
tory” infringement of the copyright in television programs. Copy-
right protection, the Court reiterated, is “wholly statutory,” and courts
should be “circumspect” in extending protections to new technology.
The Court refused to hold that contributory infringement could oc-
cur simply through the supplying of the devices with which some-

to “an individual who has invented a most useful and valuable machine. . . . [I]t
has never been pretended that the latter could hold, by the common law, any prop-

of common-law copyright was long statutorily preserved for unpublished works, but
the 1976 revision of the federal copyright law abrogated the distinction between pub-
lished and unpublished works, substituting a single federal system for that existing
since the first copyright law in 1790. 17 U.S.C. § 301.
