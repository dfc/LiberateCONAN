    This reach is not of recent origin. In United States v. Sulli-
van,889 the Court sustained a conviction of misbranding under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Sullivan, a Columbus, Geor-
gia druggist, had bought a properly labeled 1000-tablet bottle of
sulfathiazole from an Atlanta wholesaler. The bottle had been shipped
to the Atlanta wholesaler by a Chicago supplier six months earlier.
Three months after Sullivan received the bottle, he made two re-
tail sales of 12 tablets each, placing the tablets in boxes not la-
beled in strict accordance with the law. Upholding the conviction,
the Court concluded that there was no question of “the constitu-
tional power of Congress under the Commerce Clause to regulate
the branding of articles that have completed an interstate ship-
ment and are being held for future sales in purely local or intra-
state commerce.” 890
    Under the third category, Congress’s power reaches not only trans-
actions or actions that occasion the crossing of state or national bound-
aries but extends as well to activities that, though local, “affect”
commerce; this power derives from the Commerce Clause enhanced
by the Necessary and Proper Clause. The seminal case, of course,
is Wickard v. Filburn,891 sustaining federal regulation of a crop of
wheat grown on a farm and intended solely for home consumption.
The premise was that if it were never marketed, it supplied a need
otherwise to be satisfied only in the market, and that if prices rose
it might be induced onto the market. “Even activity that is purely
intrastate in character may be regulated by Congress, where the
activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated,
affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations.” 892 Cov-
erage under federal labor and wage-and-hour laws after the 1930s
showed the reality of this doctrine.893
    In upholding federal regulation of strip mining, the Court dem-
onstrated the breadth of the “affects” standard. One case dealt with
statutory provisions designed to preserve “prime farmland.” The trial
court had determined that the amount of such land disturbed annu-
ally amounted to 0.006% of the total prime farmland acreage in the
Nation and, thus, that the impact on commerce was “infinitesimal”
or “trivial.” Disagreeing, the Court said: “A court may invalidate
eral prosecutions of state officers for official corruption under criminal laws of gen-
eral applicability. E.g., McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257 (1991); McNally v.
United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987). Congress has overturned the latter case. 102
