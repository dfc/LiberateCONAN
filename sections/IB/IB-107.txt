cive to the efficient collection of the tax though they clearly tran-
scended in some respects this ground of justification.578
    Even where a tax is coupled with regulations that have no pos-
sible relation to the efficient collection of the tax, and no other pur-
pose appears on the face of the statute, the Court has refused to
inquire into the motives of the lawmakers and has sustained the
tax despite its prohibitive proportions.579 “It is beyond serious ques-
tion that a tax does not cease to be valid merely because it regu-
lates, discourages, or even definitely deters the activities taxed. . . .
The principle applies even though the revenue obtained is obvi-
ously negligible . . . or the revenue purpose of the tax may be sec-
ondary. . . . Nor does a tax statute necessarily fall because it touches
on activities which Congress might not otherwise regulate. As was
pointed out in Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40, 47 (1934):
‘From the beginning of our government, the courts have sustained
taxes although imposed with the collateral intent of effecting ulte-
rior ends which, considered apart, were beyond the constitutional
power of the lawmakers to realize by legislation directly addressed
to their accomplishment.’ ” 580
     In some cases, however, the structure of a taxation scheme is
such as to suggest that the Congress actually intends to regulate
under a separate constitutional authority. As long as such separate
authority is available to Congress, the imposition of a tax as a pen-
alty for such regulation is valid.581 On the other hand, where Con-
gress had levied a heavy tax upon liquor dealers who operated in
violation of state law, the Court held that this tax was unenforce-
able after the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, because the Na-
tional Government had no power to impose an additional penalty
for infractions of state law.582
    Discerning whether Congress, in passing a regulation that pur-
ports to be under the taxing authority, intends to exercise a sepa-
rate constitutional authority, requires evaluation of a number of fac-

     578 Without casting doubt on the ability of Congress to regulate or punish through

its taxing power, the Court has overruled Kahriger, Lewis, Doremus, Sonzinsky, and
similar cases on the ground that the statutory scheme compelled self-incrimination
through registration. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 (1968); Grosso v. United
