combined reporting method of determining the corporate franchise
tax owed by unitary multinational corporations, as applied to a for-
eign corporation. The Court determined that the tax easily satis-
fied three of the four-part Complete Auto test—nexus, apportion-
ment, and relation to state’s services—and concluded that the
nondiscrimination principle—perhaps violated by the letter of the
law—could be met by the discretion accorded state officials. As for
the two additional factors, as outlined in Japan Lines, the Court
pronounced itself satisfied. Multiple taxation was not the inevi-
table result of the tax, and that risk would not be avoided by the
use of any reasonable alternative. The tax, it was found, did not
impair federal uniformity or prevent the Federal Government from
speaking with one voice in international trade, in view of the fact
that Congress had rejected proposals that would have preempted
California’s practice.1136 The result of the case, perhaps intended,
is that foreign corporations have less protection under the negative
commerce clause.1137
    The power to regulate foreign commerce was always broader than
the states’ power to tax it, an exercise of the “police power” recog-
nized by Chief Justice Marshall in Brown v. Maryland.1138 That this
power was constrained by notions of the national interest and pre-
emption principles was evidenced in the cases striking down state
efforts to curb and regulate the actions of shippers bringing per-
sons into their ports.1139 On the other hand, quarantine legislation
to protect the states’ residents from disease and other hazards was
commonly upheld though it regulated international commerce.1140
A state game-season law applied to criminalize the possession of a
dead grouse imported from Russia was upheld because of the prac-
tical necessities of enforcement of domestic law.1141
     1136 Reliance could not be placed on Executive statements, the Court explained,

because “the Constitution expressly grants Congress, not the President, the power
to ‘regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.’ ” 512 U.S. at 329. “Executive Branch
communications that express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot render
unconstitutional California’s otherwise valid, congressionally condoned, use of world-
wide combined reporting.” Id. at 330. Dissenting Justice Scalia noted that, although
the Court’s ruling correctly restored preemptive power to Congress, “it permits the
authority to be exercised by silence. Id. at 332.”
