held that a government agency charged with the efficient adminis-
tration of the executive branch could not assert the broader inter-
ests that Congress or the President might have in barring lawfully
resident aliens from government employment. The agency could as-
sert only those interests Congress charged it with promoting, and
if the action could be justified by other interests, the office with re-
sponsibility for promoting those interests must take the action.188

                 CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS

Source of the Power to Investigate
     No provision of the Constitution expressly authorizes either house
of Congress to pursue investigations and compel testimony in order
to exercise its legislative functions. But such a power was fre-
quently exercised by both the British Parliament and the American
colonial assemblies prior to the adoption of the Constitution.189 In-
deed, it was asserted by the House of Representatives as early as
1792, appointing a committee to investigate the defeat of General
St. Clair and his army by the Indians in the Northwest and empow-
ering it to “call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be
necessary to assist their inquiries.” 190
     The Court has long since established that because such investi-
gatory power is so essential to the legislative function it is to be
implied from the general vesting of legislative power in Congress.
“We are of the opinion,” wrote Justice Van Devanter for a unani-
mous Court, “that the power of inquiry—with process to enforce it—is
an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative func-
tion. . . . A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in
the absence of information respecting the conditions which the leg-
islation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative
body does not itself possess the requisite information—which not
infrequently is true—recourse must be had to others who possess
it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information
often are unavailing, and also that information which is volun-
teered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of com-
pulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true
before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that
