ations previously detailed, the Court has refused to allow enlisted
men and officers to sue to challenge or set aside military decisions
and actions.1635
    Congress has a plenary and exclusive power to determine the
age at which a soldier or seaman shall serve, the compensation he
shall be allowed, and the service to which he shall be assigned. This
power may be exerted to supersede parents’ control of minor sons
who are needed for military service. Where the statute requiring
the consent of parents for enlistment of a minor son did not permit
such consent to be qualified, their attempt to impose a condition
that the son carry war risk insurance for the benefit of his mother
was not binding on the government.1636 Because the possession of
government insurance payable to the person of his choice is calcu-
lated to enhance the morale of the serviceman, Congress may per-
mit him to designate any beneficiary he desires, irrespective of state
law, and may exempt the proceeds from the claims of creditors.1637
Likewise, Congress may bar a state from taxing the tangible, per-
sonal property of a soldier, assigned for duty in the state, but domi-
ciled elsewhere.1638 To safeguard the health and welfare of the armed
forces, Congress may authorize the suppression of bordellos in the
vicinity of the places where forces are stationed.1639

Trial and Punishment of Offenses: Servicemen, Civilian
   Employees, and Dependents
    Under its power to make rules for the government and regula-
tion of the armed forces, Congress has set up a system of criminal
      1635 Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296 (1983) (enlisted men charging racial dis-

crimination by their superiors in duty assignments and performance evaluations could
not bring constitutional tort suits); United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987)
(officer who had been an unwitting, unconsenting subject of an Army experiment to
test the effects of LSD on human subjects could not bring a constitutional tort ac-
tion for damages). These considerations are also the basis of the Court’s construc-
tion of the Federal Tort Claims Act as not reaching injuries arising incident to mili-
tary service. Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950). In United States v. Johnson,
481 U.S. 681 (1987), four Justices urged reconsideration of Feres, but that has not
occurred.
      1636 United States v. Williams, 302 U.S. 46 (1937). See also In re Grimley, 137

U.S. 147, 153 (1890); In re Morrissey, 137 U.S. 157 (1890).
      1637 Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U.S. 655 (1950); Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U.S. 46

(1981). In the absence of express congressional language, like that found in Wissner,
the Court nonetheless held that a state court division under its community property
system of an officer’s military retirement benefits conflicted with the federal pro-
gram and could not stand. McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210 (1981). See also Por-
ter v. Aetna Casualty Co., 370 U.S. 159 (1962) (exemption from creditors’ claims of
disability benefits deposited by a veteran’s guardian in a savings and loan associa-
tion).
      1638 Dameron v. Brodhead, 345 U.S. 322 (1953). See also California v. Buzard,

382 U.S. 386 (1966); Sullivan v. United States, 395 U.S. 169 (1969).
