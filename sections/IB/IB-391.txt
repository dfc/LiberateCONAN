make compacts with each other was not surrendered under the Con-
stitution.2243 “The Compact,” as the Supreme Court has put it, “adapts
to our Union of sovereign States the age-old treaty-making power
of independent sovereign nations.” 2244 In American history, the com-
pact technique can be traced back to the numerous controversies
that arose over the ill-defined boundaries of the original colonies.
These disputes were usually resolved by negotiation, with the re-
sulting agreement subject to approval by the Crown.2245 When the
political ties with Britain were broken, the Articles of Confedera-
tion provided for appeal to Congress in all disputes between two or
more states over boundaries or “any cause whatever” 2246 and re-
quired the approval of Congress for any “treaty confederation or al-
liance” to which a state should be a party.2247
    The Framers of the Constitution went further. By the first clause
of this section they laid down an unqualified prohibition against “any
treaty, alliance or confederation,” and by the third clause they re-
quired the consent of Congress for “any agreement or compact.” The
significance of this distinction was pointed out by Chief Justice Taney
in Holmes v. Jennison: 2248 “[A]s these words [‘agreement’ and ‘com-
pact’] could not have been idly or superfluously used by the fram-
ers of the constitution, they cannot be construed to mean the same
thing with the word treaty. They evidently mean something more,
and were designed to make the prohibition more comprehen-
sive. . . . The word ‘agreement,’ does not necessarily import any di-
rect and express stipulation; nor is it necessary that it should be in
writing. If there is a verbal understanding, to which both parties
have assented, and upon which both are acting, it is an ‘agree-
ment.’ And the use of all of these terms, ‘treaty,’ ‘agreement,’ ‘com-
pact,’ show that it was the intention of the framers of the constitu-
tion to use the broadest and most comprehensive terms; and that
they anxiously desired to cut off all connection or communication
between a state and a foreign power; and we shall fail to execute
that evident intention, unless we give to the word ‘agreement’ its
most extended signification; and so apply it as to prohibit every agree-
ment, written or verbal, formal or informal[,] positive or implied,
by the mutual understanding of the parties.” 2249 But, in Virginia v.
