or tribunal.” 404 If a rule affects private rights, its construction be-
comes a judicial question. In United States v. Smith,405 the Court
held that the Senate’s reconsideration of a presidential nominee for
chairman of the Federal Power Commission, after it had confirmed
him and he had taken the oath of office, was not warranted by its
rules and did not deprive the appointee of his title to the office. In
Christoffel v. United States,406 a sharply divided Court upset a con-
viction for perjury in a federal district court of a witness who had
denied under oath before a House committee any affiliation with
Communist programs. The reversal was on the ground that, be-
cause a quorum of the committee, although present at the outset,
was not present at the time of the alleged perjury, testimony before
it was not before a “competent tribunal” within the sense of the
District of Columbia Code.407 Four Justices, in an opinion by Jus-
tice Jackson, dissented, arguing that, under the rules and practices
of the House, “a quorum once established is presumed to continue
unless and until a point of no quorum is raised” and that the Court
was, in effect, invalidating this rule, thereby invalidating at the same
time the rule of self-limitation observed by courts “where such an
issue is tendered.” 408
     The Appointments Clause provides that the President “shall nomi-
nate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall
appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of
the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise
provided for, and which shall be established by Law. . . .” 409 The
Constitution provides that “Each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings,” 410 and the Senate has enacted a cloture rule 411
requiring a supermajority vote (60 votes) to close debate on any mat-
ter pending before the Senate. Absent the invocation of cloture or
some other means of ending debate, matters can remain before the
Senate indefinitely. The practice of preventing closure is known as
a filibuster. Although no provision of the Constitution expressly re-
quires that the Senate or House act by majority vote in enacting
legislation or in exercising their other constitutional powers, the fram-
ers of the Constitution were committed to a majority rule as a gen-
     404 United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892). The Senate is “a continuing

body.” McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 181–82 (1927). Hence its rules remain
in force from Congress to Congress except as they are changed from time to time,
whereas those of the House are readopted at the outset of each new Congress.
