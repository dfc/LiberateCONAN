it condemned the involvement of private trade groups in the draw-
ing up of binding codes of competition in conjunction with govern-
mental agencies, but the Court’s principal objection was to the stat-
ute’s lack of adequate standards.165 In Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,166
the Court struck down the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act in
part because the statute penalized persons who failed to observe
minimum wage and maximum hour regulations drawn up by pre-
scribed majorities of coal producers and coal employees. But the prob-
lem for the Court apparently was not so much that the statute del-
egated to private entities as that it delegated to private entities whose
interests were adverse to the interests of those regulated, thereby
denying the latter due process.167 And several later cases have up-
held delegations to private entities.168
     Even though the Court has upheld some delegations to private
entities by reference to cases involving delegations to public agen-
cies, some uncertainty remains as to whether identical standards
apply in the two situations. Schechter contrasted the National In-
dustrial Recovery Act’s broad and virtually standardless delegation
to the President, assisted by private trade groups,169 with other broad
delegations of authority to administrative agencies, characterized
by the Court as bodies of experts “required to act upon notice and
hearing,” and further limited by the requirement that binding or-
ders must be “supported by findings of fact which in turn are sus-
tained by evidence.” 170 The absence of these procedural protec-
tions, designed to ensure fairness—as well as the possible absence
of impartiality identified in Carter Coal—could be cited to support
closer scrutiny of private delegations. Although the Court has em-
     165 A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537 (1935).

In two subsequent cases, the Court referred to Schechter as having struck down a
delegation for its lack of standards. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373
n.7 (1989); Whitman v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 474 (2001).
     166 298 U.S. 238 (1936). But compare Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins,

310 U.S. 381 (1940) (upholding a delegation in the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937).
     167 “One person may not be entrusted with the power to regulate the business

of another, and especially of a competitor.” 298 U.S. at 311.
     168 See, e.g., Schweiker v. McClure, 456 U.S. 188 (1992) (adjudication of Medi-

care claims, without right of appeal, by hearing officer appointed by private insur-
ance carrier upheld under due process challenge); Association of Amer. Physicians
& Surgeons v. Weinberger, 395 F. Supp. 125 (N.D. Ill.) (three-judge court) (delega-
tion to Professional Standards Review Organization), aff’d per curiam, 423 U.S. 975
(1975); Noblecraft Industries v. Secretary of Labor, 614 F.2d 199 (9th Cir. 1980) (Sec-
retary authorized to adopt interim OSHA standards produced by private organiza-
tion). Executive Branch objections to these kinds of delegations have involved ap-
pointments clause arguments rather than delegation issues per se.
     169 The Act conferred authority on the President to approve the codes of compe-

tition, either as proposed by the appropriate trade group, or with conditions that he
added. Thus the principal delegation was to the President, with the private trade
groups being delegated only recommendatory authority. 295 U.S. at 538–39.
     170 295 U.S. at 539.
