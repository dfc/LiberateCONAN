tween the States, not to permit the creation of impediments to such
intercourse; while the former clothed Congress with that power over
international commerce, pertaining to a sovereign nation in its in-
tercourse with foreign nations, and subject, generally speaking, to
no implied or reserved power in the States. The laws which would
be necessary and proper in the one case, would not be necessary or
proper in the other.” 701
    Twelve years later, Chief Justice White, speaking for the Court,
expressed the same view: “In the argument reference is made to
decisions of this court dealing with the subject of the power of Con-
gress to regulate interstate commerce, but the very postulate upon
which the authority of Congress to absolutely prohibit foreign im-
portations as expounded by the decisions of this court rests is the
broad distinction which exists between the two powers and there-
fore the cases cited and many more which might be cited announc-
ing the principles which they uphold have obviously no relation to
the question in hand.” 702
      But dicta to the contrary are much more numerous and span a
far longer period of time. Thus Chief Justice Taney wrote in 1847:
“The power to regulate commerce among the several States is granted
to Congress in the same clause, and by the same words, as the power
to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and is coextensive with
it.” 703 And nearly fifty years later, Justice Field, speaking for the
Court, said: “The power to regulate commerce among the several
States was granted to Congress in terms as absolute as is the power
to regulate commerce with foreign nations.” 704 Today it is firmly
established that the power to regulate commerce, whether with for-
eign nations or among the several states, comprises the power to
restrain or prohibit it at all times for the welfare of the public, pro-
vided only that the specific limitations imposed upon Congress’s pow-
ers, as by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, are not
transgressed.705

Instruments of Commerce
   The applicability of Congress’s power to the agents and instru-
ments of commerce is implied in Marshall’s opinion in Gibbons v.
    701 Lottery Case (Champion v. Ames), 188 U.S. 321, 373 (1903).
    702 Brolan v. United States, 236 U.S. 216, 222 (1915). The most recent dicta to
this effect appears in Japan Line v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434, 448–51
(1979), a “dormant” commerce clause case involving state taxation with an impact
on foreign commerce. In context, the distinction seems unexceptionable, but the lan-
guage extends beyond context.
    703 License Cases, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 504, 578 (1847).
    704 Pittsburg & Southern Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U.S. 577, 587 (1895).
    705 United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 147–148 (1938).
