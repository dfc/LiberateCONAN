tance by a designated majority of his creditors and confirmation by
a bankruptcy court. This measure was held constitutional,1401 as were
later acts, which provided for the reorganization of corporations that
are insolvent or unable to meet their debts as they mature,1402 and
for the composition and extension of debts in proceedings for the
relief of individual farmer debtors.1403
    Nor is the power of Congress limited to adjustment of the rights
of creditors. The Supreme Court has also ruled that the rights of a
purchaser at a judicial sale of the debtor’s property are within reach
of the bankruptcy power, and may be modified by a reasonable ex-
tension of the period for redemption from such sale.1404 Moreover,
the Court expanded the bankruptcy court’s power over the prop-
erty of the estate by affording the trustee affirmative relief on coun-
terclaim against a creditor filing a claim against the estate.1405
    Underlying most Court decisions and statutes in this area is
the desire to achieve equity and fairness in the distribution of the
bankrupt’s funds.1406 United States v. Speers,1407 codified by an amend-
ment to the Bankruptcy Act,1408 furthered this objective by strength-
ening the position of the trustee as regards the priority of a federal
tax lien unrecorded at the time of bankruptcy.1409 The Supreme Court
has held, in other cases dealing with the priority of various credi-
tors’ claims, that claims arising from the tort of the receiver is an
“actual and necessary” cost of administration,1410 that benefits un-
der a nonparticipating annuity plan are not wages and are there-
fore not given priority,1411 and that when taxes are allowed against
a bankrupt’s estate, penalties due because of the trustee’s failure
to pay the taxes incurred while operating a bankrupt business are
also allowable.1412 The Court’s attitude with regard to these and other
developments is perhaps best summarized in the opinion in Conti-
nental Bank v. Rock Island Ry.,1413 where Justice Sutherland wrote,
on behalf of a unanimous court: “[T]hese acts, far-reaching though
they may be, have not gone beyond the limit of Congressional power;
