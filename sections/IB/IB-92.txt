ers.478 It applies, in the context of the permissibility of Senate amend-
ments to a House-passed bill, to all bills for collecting revenue—
revenue decreasing as well as revenue increasing—rather than simply
to just those bills that increase revenue.479
    Only bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word are com-
prehended by the phrase “all bills for raising revenue”; bills for other
purposes, which incidentally create revenue, are not included.480 Thus,
a Senate-initiated bill that provided for a monetary “special assess-
ment” to pay into a crime victims fund did not violate the clause,
because it was a statute that created and raised revenue to sup-
port a particular governmental program and was not a law raising
revenue to support Government generally.481 An act providing a na-
tional currency secured by a pledge of bonds of the United States,
which, “in the furtherance of that object, and also to meet the ex-
penses attending the execution of the act,” imposed a tax on the
circulating notes of national banks was held not to be a revenue
measure which must originate in the House of Representatives.482
Neither was a bill that provided that the District of Columbia should
raise by taxation and pay to designated railroad companies a speci-
fied sum for the elimination of grade crossings and the construc-
tion of a railway station.483 The substitution of a corporation tax
for an inheritance tax,484 and the addition of a section imposing an
excise tax upon the use of foreign-built pleasure yachts,485 have been
held to be within the Senate’s constitutional power to propose amend-
ments.

Approval by the President
    The President is not restricted to signing a bill on a day when
Congress is in session.486 He may sign within ten days (Sundays
excepted) after the bill is presented to him, even if that period ex-

     479 The issue of coverage is sometimes important, as in the case of the Tax Eq-

uity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 324, in which the House passed
a bill that provided for a net loss in revenue and the Senate amended the bill to
provide a revenue increase of more than $98 billion over three years. Attacks on the
law as a violation of the origination clause failed before assertions of political ques-
tion, standing, and other doctrines. E.g., Texas Ass’n of Concerned Taxpayers v. United
States, 772 F.2d 163 (5th Cir. 1985); Moore v. U.S. House of Representatives, 733
F.2d 946 (D.C. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985).
