agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopt-
ing in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute,” 130 the
Court concluded.
    Although Congress must ordinarily provide some guidance that
indicates broad policy objectives, there is no general prohibition on
delegating authority that includes the exercise of policy judgment.
In Mistretta v. United States,131 the Court approved congressional
delegations to the United States Sentencing Commission, an inde-
pendent agency in the judicial branch, to develop and promulgate
guidelines binding federal judges and cabining their discretion in
sentencing criminal defendants. Although the Court enumerated the
standards Congress had provided, it admitted that significant dis-
cretion existed with respect to making policy judgments about the
relative severity of different crimes and the relative weight of the
characteristics of offenders that are to be considered, and stated forth-
rightly that delegations may carry with them “the need to exercise
judgment on matters of policy.” 132 A number of cases illustrate the
point. For example, the Court has upheld complex economic regula-
tions of industries in instances in which the agencies had first de-
nied possession of such power, had unsuccessfully sought authoriza-
tion from Congress, and had finally acted without the requested
congressional guidance.133 The Court has also recognized that, when
Administrations change, new officials may have sufficient discre-
tion under governing statutes to change or even reverse agency poli-
cies.134
    It seems therefore reasonably clear that the Court does not re-
quire much in the way of standards from Congress. The minimum
upon which the Court usually insists is that Congress use a delega-
tion that “sufficiently marks the field within which the Administra-
tor is to act so that it may be known whether he has kept within it
in compliance with the legislative will.” 135 Where the congressional
standards are combined with requirements of notice and hearing
and statements of findings and considerations by the administra-
tors, so that judicial review under due process standards is pos-
