Dunbar Co.,728 that in constructing works for the improvement of
the navigability of a stream, Congress was entitled, as part of a
general plan, to authorize the lease or sale of such excess water
power as might result from the conservation of the flow of the stream.
“If the primary purpose is legitimate,” it said, “we can see no sound
objection to leasing any excess of power over the needs of the Gov-
ernment. The practice is not unusual in respect to similar public
works constructed by State governments.” 729
     Since the Chandler-Dunbar case, the Court has come, in effect,
to hold that it will sustain any act of Congress that purports to be
for the improvement of navigation whatever other purposes it may
also embody, nor does the stream involved have to be one “navi-
gable in its natural state.” Such, at least, seems to be the sum of
its holdings in Arizona v. California,730 and United States v. Appa-
lachian Power Co.731 In the former, the Court, speaking through Jus-
tice Brandeis, said that it was not free to inquire into the motives
“which induced members of Congress to enact the Boulder Canyon
Project Act,” adding: “As the river is navigable and the means which
the Act provides are not unrelated to the control of navigation . . .
the erection and maintenance of such dam and reservoir are clearly
within the powers conferred upon Congress. Whether the particu-
lar structures proposed are reasonably necessary, is not for this Court
to determine. . . . And the fact that purposes other than naviga-
tion will also be served could not invalidate the exercise of the au-
thority conferred, even if those other purposes would not alone have
justified an exercise of congressional power.” 732
     And, in the Appalachian Power case, the Court, abandoning pre-
vious holdings laying down the doctrine that to be subject to Con-
gress’s power to regulate commerce a stream must be “navigable in
fact,” said: “A waterway, otherwise suitable for navigation, is not
barred from that classification merely because artificial aids must
make the highway suitable for use before commercial navigation may
be undertaken,” provided there must be a “balance between cost and
need at a time when the improvement would be useful. . . . Nor is
it necessary that the improvements should be actually completed
or even authorized. The power of Congress over commerce is not to
be hampered because of the necessity for reasonable improvements
to make an interstate waterway available for traffic. . . . Nor is it
