               QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

       When the Qualifications Must Be Possessed
           A question much disputed but now seemingly settled is whether
       a condition of eligibility must exist at the time of the election or
       whether it is sufficient that eligibility exist when the Member-elect
       presents himself to take the oath of office. Although the language
       of the clause expressly makes residency in the state a condition at
       the time of election, it now appears established in congressional prac-
       tice that the age and citizenship qualifications need only be met
       when the Member-elect is to be sworn.318 Thus, persons elected to
       either the House of Representatives or the Senate before attaining
       the required age or term of citizenship have been admitted as soon
       as they became qualified.319

       Exclusivity of Constitutional Qualifications
            Congressional Additions.—Writing in The Federalist with ref-
       erence to the election of Members of Congress, Hamilton firmly stated
       that “[t]he qualifications of the persons who may . . . be chosen . . .
       are defined and fixed in the constitution; and are unalterable by
       the legislature.” 320 Until the Civil War, the issue was not raised,
       the only actions taken by either House conforming to the idea that
       the qualifications for membership could not be enlarged by statute
       or practice.321 But in the passions aroused by the fratricidal con-
       flict, Congress enacted a law requiring its members to take an oath
       that they had never been disloyal to the National Government.322
       Several persons were refused seats by both Houses because of charges
       of disloyalty,323 and thereafter House practice, and Senate practice

       of a claimed additional state qualification.
