ence between these two cases is obviously slight, but the later one
is unquestionable authority for the proposition that legislative boun-
ties are repealable at will.
    Furthermore, exemptions from taxation have in certain cases
been treated as gratuities repealable at will, even when conferred
by specific legislative enactments. This would seem always to be
the case when the beneficiaries were already in existence when the
exemption was created and did nothing of a more positive nature
to qualify for it than to continue in existence.2088 Yet the cases are
not always easy to explain in relation to each other, except in light
of the fact that the Court’s point of view has altered from time to
time.2089
    “Contracts” Include Public Contracts and Corporate Char-
ters.—The question, which was settled very early, was whether the
clause was intended to be applied solely in protection of private con-
tracts or in the protection also of public grants, or, more broadly, in
protection of public contracts, in short, those to which a state is a
party.2090 Support for the affirmative answer accorded this question
could be derived from the following sources. For one thing, the clause
departed from the comparable provision in the Northwest Ordi-
nance (1787) in two respects: first, in the presence of the word “ob-
ligation;” secondly, in the absence of the word “private.” There is
good reason for believing that James Wilson may have been respon-
sible for both alterations, as two years earlier he had denounced a
current proposal to repeal the Bank of North America’s Pennsylva-
nia charter in the following words: “If the act for incorporating the
subscribers to the Bank of North America shall be repealed in this
manner, every precedent will be established for repealing, in the
same manner, every other legislative charter in Pennsylvania. A pre-

     2090 According to Benjamin F. Wright, throughout the first century of govern-

ment under the Constitution “the contract clause had been considered in almost forty
per cent of all cases involving the validity of State legislation,” and of these the vast
proportion involved legislative grants of one type or other, the most important cat-
egory being charters of incorporation. However, the numerical prominence of such
grants in the cases does not overrate their relative importance from the point of
view of public interest. B. WRIGHT, THE CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION 95 (1938).
     Madison explained the clause by allusion to what had occurred “in the internal
administration of the States” in the years preceding the Constitutional Convention,
in regard to private debts. Violations of contracts had become familiar in the form
of depreciated paper made legal tender, of property substituted for money, of install-
ment laws, and of the occlusions of the courts of justice. 3 M. FARRAND, THE RECORDS
