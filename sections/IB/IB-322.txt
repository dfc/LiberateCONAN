are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, are constitutional.” 1819 Moreover, the provision gives
Congress a share in the responsibilities lodged in other depart-
ments, by virtue of its right to enact legislation necessary to carry
into execution all powers vested in the National Government. Con-
versely, where necessary for the efficient execution of its own pow-
ers, Congress may delegate some measure of legislative power to
other departments.1820
     Practically every power of the National Government has been
expanded in some degree by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Un-
der the authority granted it by that clause, Congress has adopted
measures requisite to discharge the treaty obligations of the na-
tion,1821 has organized the federal judicial system, and has enacted
a large body of law defining and punishing crimes. Effective control
of the national economy has been made possible by the authority
to regulate the internal commerce of a state to the extent neces-
sary to protect and promote interstate commerce.1822 The right of
Congress to use all known and appropriate means for collecting rev-
enue, including the distraint of property for federal taxes,1823 and
to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property for pub-
lic use,1824 have greatly extended the range of national power. But
the widest application of the Necessary and Proper Clause has oc-
curred in the field of monetary and fiscal controls. Because the vari-
ous specific powers granted by Article I, § 8, do not add up to a
general legislative power over such matters, the Court has relied
heavily upon this clause to sustain the comprehensive control that
Congress has asserted over this subject.1825

estate of a bankrupt he wrote: “The government is to pay the debt of the Union,
and must be authorized to use the means which appear to itself most eligible to
effect that object. It has, consequently, a right to make remittance, by bills or other-
wise, and to take those precautions which will render the transaction safe.”
