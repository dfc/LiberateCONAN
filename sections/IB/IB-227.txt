    Congress may preempt state regulation without itself prescrib-
ing a federal standard; it may deregulate a field and thus occupy it
by opting for market regulation and precluding state or local regu-
lation.1195
    Conflict Preemption. Several possible situations will lead to a
holding that a state law is preempted as in conflict with federal
law. First, it may be that the two laws, federal and state, will actu-
ally conflict. Thus, in Rose v. Arkansas State Police,1196 federal law
provided for death benefits for state law enforcement officers “in ad-
dition to” any other compensation, while the state law required a
reduction in state benefits by the amount received from other sources.
The Court, in a brief, per curiam opinion, had no difficulty finding
the state provision preempted.1197
    Second, conflict preemption may occur when it is practically im-
possible to comply with the terms of both laws. Thus, where a fed-
eral agency had authorized federal savings and loan associations to
include “due-on-sale” clauses in their loan instruments and where
the state had largely prevented inclusion of such clauses, while it
was literally possible for lenders to comply with both rules, the fed-
eral rule being permissive, the state regulation prevented the exer-
cise of the flexibility the federal agency had conferred and was pre-
empted.1198 More problematic are circumstances in which a party
has an administrative avenue for seeking removal of impediments
