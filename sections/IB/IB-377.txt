law which supplies one party to a contract with a remedy if the
other party does not live up to his agreement, as authoritatively
interpreted, entered into the “obligation of contracts” in the consti-
tutional sense of this term, and so might not be altered to the ma-
terial weakening of existing contracts. In the Court’s own words:
“Nothing can be more material to the obligation than the means of
enforcement. Without the remedy the contract may, indeed, in the
sense of the law, be said not to exist, and its obligation to fall within
the class of those moral and social duties which depend for their
fulfillment wholly upon the will of the individual. The ideas of va-
lidity and remedy are inseparable. . . .” 2158
    This rule was first definitely announced in 1843 in Bronson v.
Kinzie.2159 Here, an Illinois mortgage giving the mortgagee an un-
restricted power of sale in case of the mortgagor’s default was in-
volved, along with a later act of the legislature that required mort-
gaged premises to be sold for not less than two-thirds of the appraised
value and allowed the mortgagor a year after the sale to redeem
them. It was held that the statute, in altering the pre-existing rem-
edies to such an extent, violated the constitutional prohibition and
hence was void. The year following a like ruling was made in Mc-
Cracken v. Hayward,2160 as to a statutory provision that personal
property should not be sold under execution for less than two-
thirds of its appraised value.
     But the rule illustrated by these cases does not signify that a
state may make no changes in its remedial or procedural law that
affect existing contracts. “Provided,” the Court has said, “a substan-
tial or efficacious remedy remains or is given, by means of which a
party can enforce his rights under the contract, the Legislature may
modify or change existing remedies or prescribe new modes of pro-
cedure.” 2161 Thus, states are constantly remodelling their judicial
systems and modes of practice unembarrassed by the Contract
Clause.2162 The right of a state to abolish imprisonment for debt
was early asserted.2163 Again, the right of a state to shorten the
time for the bringing of actions has been affirmed even as to exist-
ing causes of action, but with the proviso added that a reasonable
time must be left for the bringing of such actions.2164 On the other
