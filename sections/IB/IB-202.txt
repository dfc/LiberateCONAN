    Regulation.—The modern standard of Commerce Clause re-
view of state regulation of, or having an impact on, interstate com-
merce was adopted in Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona,1082 although
it was presaged in a series of opinions, mostly dissents, by Chief
Justice Stone.1083 Southern Pacific tested the validity of a state train-
length law, justified as a safety measure. Revising a hundred years
of doctrine, the Chief Justice wrote that whether a state or local
regulation was valid depended upon a “reconciliation of the conflict-
ing claims of state and national power [that] is to be attained only
by some appraisal and accommodation of the competing demands
of the state and national interests involved.” 1084 Save in those few
cases in which Congress has acted, “this Court, and not the state
legislature, is under the commerce clause the final arbiter of the
competing demands of state and national interests.” 1085
     That the test to be applied was a balancing one, the Chief Jus-
tice made clear at length, stating that, in order to determine whether
the challenged regulation was permissible, “matters for ultimate de-
termination are the nature and extent of the burden which the state
regulation of interstate trains, adopted as a safety measure, im-
poses on interstate commerce, and whether the relative weights of
the state and national interests involved are such as to make inap-
plicable the rule, generally observed, that the free flow of inter-
state commerce and its freedom from local restraints in matters re-
quiring uniformity of regulation are interests safeguarded by the
commerce clause from state interference.” 1086
    The test today continues to be the Stone articulation, although
the more frequently quoted encapsulation of it is from Pike v. Bruce
Church, Inc.: “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectu-
ate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate
commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden
imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the
putative local benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found, then
the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden

U.S. 429 (2005), upholding imposition of a flat annual fee on all trucks engaged in
intrastate hauling (including trucks engaged in interstate hauling that “top off ” loads
with intrastate pickups and deliveries) and concluding that levying the fee on a per-
truck rather than per-mile basis was permissible in view of the objectives of defray-
ing costs of administering various size, weight, safety, and insurance requirements.
