        the new Congress, which would take effect if Congress did not dis-
        approve it. The Attorney General ruled that, as the clause would
        not apply if the increase were proposed and approved subsequent
        to the appointment, it similarly would not apply in a situation in
        which it was uncertain whether the increase would be approved.471
        Incompatible Offices
             This second part of the second clause elicited little discussion
        at the Convention and was universally understood to be a safe-
        guard against executive influence on Members of Congress and the
        prevention of the corruption of the separation of powers.472 Con-
        gress has at various times confronted the issue in regard to seat-
        ing or expelling persons who have or obtain office in another branch.
        Thus, it has determined that visitors to academies, regents, direc-
        tors, and trustees of public institutions, and members of temporary
        commissions who receive no compensation as members are not offi-
        cers within the constitutional inhibition.473 Government contrac-
        tors and federal officers who resign before presenting their creden-
        tials may be seated as Members of Congress.474
             One of the more recurrent problems which Congress has had
        with this clause is the compatibility of congressional office with ser-
        vice as an officer of some military organization—militia, reserves,
        and the like.475 Members have been unseated for accepting appoint-
        ment to military office during their terms of congressional office,476
        but there are apparently no instances in which a Member-elect has
        been excluded for this reason. Because of the difficulty of success-
        fully claiming standing, the issue has never been a litigable mat-
        ter.477
