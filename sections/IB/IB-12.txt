cally taken a strong protective position on behalf of the President’s
powers, but such posture has been maintained with only varying
degrees of success.12
    Following this lengthy period of relative inattention to separa-
tion of powers issues, the Court since 1976 13 has relied on the doc-
trine in numerous cases, with the result being a substantial curtail-
ing of congressional discretion to structure the National Government.
In short order, the Court found constitutional barriers to: a congres-
sional scheme to provide for automatic deficit-reduction based on
the critical involvement of an officer with significant legislative ties; 14
the practice set out in more than 200 laws of allowing a congressio-
nal veto of executive actions; 15 and the vesting of broad judicial pow-
ers to handle bankruptcy cases in officers not possessing security
of tenure and salary.16 On the other hand, the Court upheld the
highly debated establishment by Congress of a process by which in-
dependent special prosecutors could be appointed to investigate and
prosecute cases of alleged corruption in the Executive Branch. This
latter opinion presaged a judicial approach more accepting of the
blending of governmental functions at the federal level.17
    Important as the results were in this series of cases, it was the
development of two separate and inconsistent analytical ap-
proaches that has occasioned the greatest amount of commentary.
The existence of the two approaches, either of which can appar-
ently be employed at the discretion of the Justices, makes it diffi-
cult to predict the outcomes of cases involving alternative fashions
of implementing governmental policy. Historically, it appears that
the Court most often uses a more strict analysis in cases in which
infringements of executive powers are alleged and a less strict analy-
sis when the powers of the other two branches are concerned. The
special prosecutor decision, however, followed by a decision sustain-
ing the appointment of judges to the United States Sentencing Com-
mission, may ultimately signal the adoption of the less strict analy-

    12 The principal example is Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), written

by Chief Justice Taft, himself a former President. The breadth of the holding was
modified in considerable degree in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S.
602 (1935), and the premise of the decision itself was recast and largely softened in
Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988).
    13 Beginning with Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109–43 (1976), a relatively easy

case, in which Congress had attempted to reserve to itself the power to appoint cer-
tain officers charged with enforcement of a law.
