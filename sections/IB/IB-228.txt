to dual compliance. In Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing,1199 federal law re-
quired generic drugs to be labeled the same as the brand name coun-
terpart, while state tort law required drug labels to contain ad-
equate warnings to render use of the drug reasonably safe. There
had been accumulating evidence that long-term use of the drug
metoclopramide carried a significant risk of severe neurological dam-
age, but manufacturers of generic metoclopramide neither amended
their warning labels nor sought to have the Food and Drug Admin-
istration require the brand name manufacturer to include stronger
label warnings, which consequently would have led to stronger la-
beling of the generic. Five Justices held that state tort law was pre-
empted.1200 It was impossible to comply both with the state law duty
to change the label and the federal law duty to keep the label the
same.1201 The four dissenting Justices argued that inability to change
the labels unilaterally was insufficient, standing alone, to establish
a defense based on impossibility.1202 Emphasizing the federal duty
to monitor the safety of their drugs, the dissenters would require
that the generic manufacturers also show some effort to effectuate
a labeling change through the FDA.
    In contrast to Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, the Court found no preemp-
tion in Wyeth v. Levine,1203 a state tort action against a brand-
name drug manufacturer based on inadequate labeling. A brand-
name drug manufacturer, unlike makers of generic drugs, could
unilaterally strengthen labeling under federal regulations, subject
to subsequent FDA override, and thereby independently meet state
tort law requirements. In another case of alleged impossibility, it
was held possible for an employer to comply both with a state law
mandating leave and reinstatement to pregnant employees and with
a federal law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis
of pregnancy.1204 Similarly, when faced with both federal and state
standards on the ripeness of avocados, the Court discerned that the

premacy Clause phrase “any [state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding” as a non
obtstante provision that “suggests that federal law should be understood to impliedly
repeal conflicting state law” and indicates limits on the extent to which courts should
seek to reconcile federal and state law in preemption cases. 564 U.S. ___, No. 09–

state standards were harmonious with purposes of federal law).
