the tariff duties on imported goods,” 207 the two Houses have as-
serted the right to collect information from private persons as well
as from governmental agencies when necessary to enlighten their
judgment on proposed legislation. The first case to review the asser-
tion saw a narrow view of the power taken and the Court held that
the purpose of the inquiry was to pry improperly into private af-
fairs without any possibility of legislating on the basis of what might
be learned and further that the inquiry overstepped the bounds of
legislative jurisdiction and invaded the provinces of the judi-
ciary.208
     Subsequent cases, however, have given Congress the benefit of
a presumption that its object is legitimate and related to the pos-
sible enactment of legislation. Shortly after Kilbourn, the Court de-
clared that “it was certainly not necessary that the resolution should
declare in advance what the Senate meditated doing when the in-
vestigation was concluded” in order that the inquiry be under a law-
ful exercise of power.209 Similarly, in McGrain v. Daugherty,210 the
investigation was presumed to have been undertaken in good faith
to aid the Senate in legislating. Then, in Sinclair v. United States,211
on its facts presenting a close parallel to Kilbourn, the Court af-
firmed the right of the Senate to carry out investigations of fraudu-
lent leases of government property after suit for recovery had been
instituted. The president of the lessee corporation had refused to
testify on the ground that the questions related to his private af-
fairs and to matters cognizable only in the courts wherein they were
pending, asserting that the inquiry was not actually in aid of legis-
lation. The Senate had prudently directed the investigating commit-
tee to ascertain what, if any, legislation might be advisable. Conced-
ing “that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for
the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits,” the Court
declared that the authority “to require pertinent disclosures in aid
of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the informa-
tion sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits.” 212
     Although Sinclair and McGrain involved inquiries into the ac-
tivities and dealings of private persons, these activities and deal-
ings were in connection with property belonging to the United States
Government, so that it could hardly be said that the inquiries con-
