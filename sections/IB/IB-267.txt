obligation of the parties is, therefore, assumed with reference to that
power,” 1443 the Supreme Court sustained the power of Congress to
make Treasury notes legal tender in satisfaction of antecedent debts,1444
and, many years later, to abrogate the clauses in private contracts
calling for payment in gold coin, even though such contracts were
executed before the legislation was passed.1445 The power to coin
money also imports authority to maintain such coinage as a me-
dium of exchange at home, and to forbid its diversion to other uses
by defacement, melting or exportation.1446

Punishment of Counterfeiting
     In its affirmative aspect, this clause has been given a narrow
interpretation; it has been held not to cover the circulation of coun-
terfeit coin or the possession of equipment susceptible of use for
making counterfeit coin.1447 At the same time, the Supreme Court
has rebuffed attempts to read into this provision a limitation upon
either the power of the States or upon the powers of Congress un-
der the preceding clause. It has ruled that a state may punish the
issuance of forged coins.1448 On the ground that the power of Con-
gress to coin money imports “the correspondent and necessary power
and obligation to protect and to preserve in its purity this constitu-
tional currency for the benefit of the nation,” 1449 it has sustained
federal statutes penalizing the importation or circulation of counter-
feit coin,1450 or the willing and conscious possession of dies in the
likeness of those used for making coins of the United States.1451 In
short, the above clause is entirely superfluous. Congress would have
had the power it purports to confer under the Necessary and Proper
Clause; and the same is the case with the other enumerated crimes
it is authorized to punish. The enumeration was unnecessary and
is not exclusive.1452

Borrowing Power Versus Fiscal Power
   Usually the aggregate of the fiscal and monetary powers of the
National Government—to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money
and to coin money and regulate the value thereof—have reinforced
