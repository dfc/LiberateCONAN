Legal Effect of Interstate Compacts
    Whenever, by the agreement of the states concerned and the
consent of Congress, an interstate compact comes into operation, it
has the same effect as a treaty between sovereign powers. Bound-
aries established by such compacts become binding upon all citi-
zens of the signatory states and are conclusive as to their rights.2263
Private rights may be affected by agreements for the equitable ap-
portionment of the water of an interstate stream, without a judi-
cial determination of existing rights.2264 Valid interstate compacts
are within the protection of the Contract Clause,2265 and a “sue and
be sued” provision therein operates as a waiver of immunity from
suit in federal courts otherwise afforded by the Eleventh Amend-
ment.2266 The Supreme Court in the exercise of its original jurisdic-
tion may enforce interstate compacts following principles of gen-
eral contract law.2267 Congress also has authority to compel compliance
with such compacts.2268 Nor may a state read herself out of a com-
pact which she has ratified and to which Congress has consented
by pleading that under the state’s constitution as interpreted by the
highest state court she had lacked power to enter into such an agree-
ment and was without power to meet certain obligations thereun-
der. The final construction of the state constitution in such a case
rests with the Supreme Court.2269

    2267 Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U.S. 124 (1987). If the compact makes no provi-

sion for resolving impasse, then the Court may exercise its jurisdiction to apportion
waters of interstate streams. In doing so, however, the Court will not rewrite the
compact by ordering appointment of a third voting commissioner to serve as a tie-
breaker; rather, the Court will attempt to apply the compact to the extent that its
provisions govern the controversy. Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U.S. 554 (1983).
