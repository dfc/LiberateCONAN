government in the District, with the major offices filled by elec-
tion. 1779 District residents vote for President and Vice Presi-

tween residents of the District of Columbia and the citizens of a
state.1788 The decision was by a five to four division, but the five in
the majority disagreed among themselves on the reasons. Three
