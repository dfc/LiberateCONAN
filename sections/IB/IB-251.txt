But it seems equally clear that with regard to retention of citizen-
ship, naturalized citizens are not in the secure position of citizens
born here.1330
    On another point, the Court has held that, absent a treaty or
statute to the contrary, a child born in the United States who is
taken during minority to the country of his parents’ origin, where
his parents resume their former allegiance, does not thereby lose
his American citizenship and that it is not necessary for him to make
an election and return to the United States.1331 On still another
point, it has been held that naturalization is so far retroactive as
to validate an acquisition of land prior to naturalization as to which
the alien was under a disability.1332

Expatriation: Loss of Citizenship
     The history of the right of expatriation, voluntarily on the part
of the citizen or involuntarily under duress of statute, is shadowy
in United States constitutional law. Justice Story, in the course of
an opinion,1333 and Chancellor Kent, in his writings,1334 accepted
the ancient English doctrine of perpetual and unchangeable alle-
giance to the government of one’s birth, a citizen being precluded
from renouncing his allegiance without permission of that govern-
ment. The pre-Civil War record on the issue is so vague because
there was wide disagreement on the basis of national citizenship in
the first place, with some contending that national citizenship was
derivative from state citizenship, which would place the power of
providing for expatriation in the state legislatures, and with others
contending for the primacy of national citizenship, which would place
the power in Congress.1335 The citizenship basis was settled by the
first sentence of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but expatria-
tion continued to be a muddled topic. An 1868 statute specifically
recognized “the right of expatriation” by individuals, but it was di-
rected to affirming the right of foreign nationals to expatriate them-

     1330 At least, there is a difference so long as Afroyim prevents Congress from

making expatriation the consequence of certain acts when done by natural born citi-
zens as well.
     1331 Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325 (1939). The qualifying phrase “absent a treaty

or statute . . . ” is error now, so long as Afroyim remains in effect. But note Rogers
v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815, 832–833 (1971).
