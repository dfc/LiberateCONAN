law binding on all servicemen, with its own substantive laws, its
own courts and procedures, and its own appeals procedure.1640 The
drafters of these congressional enactments conceived of a military
justice system with application to all servicemen wherever they are,
to reservists while on inactive duty training, and to certain civil-
ians in special relationships to the military. In recent years, all these
conceptions have been restricted.
    Servicemen.—Although there had been extensive disagree-
ment about the practice of court-martial trial of servicemen for non-
military offenses,1641 the matter never was raised in substantial de-
gree until the Cold War period when the United States found it
essential to maintain both at home and abroad a large standing
army in which great numbers of servicemen were draftees. In
O’Callahan v. Parker,1642 the Court held that court-martial jurisdic-
tion was lacking to try servicemen charged with a crime that was
not “service connected.” The Court did not define “service connec-
tion,” but among the factors it found relevant were that the crime
in question was committed against a civilian in peacetime in the
United States off-base while the serviceman was lawfully off duty.1643
O’Callahan was overruled in Solorio v. United States,1644 the Court
holding that “the requirements of the Constitution are not violated
where . . . a court-martial is convened to try a serviceman who was
a member of the armed services at the time of the offense charged.” 1645
Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court insisted that
O’Callahan had been based on erroneous readings of English and
American history, and that “the service connection approach . . . has
proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.” 1646
    It is not clear what provisions of the Bill of Rights and other
constitutional guarantees apply to court-martial trials. The Fifth
Amendment expressly excepts “[c]ases arising in the land and na-

military-court conviction on the basis that the service-connection test had been met,
the Court elected to reconsider and overrule O’Callahan altogether.
