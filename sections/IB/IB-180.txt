protect articles of commerce from hostile legislation and that the
power asserted by the state belonged exclusively to Congress, the
Court observed that “[t]he fact that Congress has not seen fit to
prescribe any specific rules to govern inter-State commerce does not
affect the question. Its inaction on this subject . . . is equivalent to
a declaration that inter-State commerce shall be free and untram-
melled.” 968
    It has been evidently of little importance to the Court to ex-
plain. “Whether or not this long recognized distribution of power
between the national and state governments is predicated upon the
implications of the commerce clause itself . . . or upon the pre-
sumed intention of Congress, where Congress has not spoken . . .
the result is the same.” 969 Thus, “[f]or a hundred years it has been
accepted constitutional doctrine . . . that . . . where Congress has
not acted, this Court, and not the state legislature, is under the
commerce clause the final arbiter of the competing demands of state
and national interests.” 970
     Two other justifications can be found throughout the Court’s de-
cisions, but they do not explain why the Court is empowered under
a grant of power to Congress to police state regulatory and taxing
decisions. For example, in Welton v. Missouri,971 the statute under
review, as the Court observed several times, was clearly discrimina-
tory as between in-state and interstate commerce, but that point
was not sharply drawn as the constitutional fault of the law. That
the Commerce Clause had been motivated by the Framers’ appre-
hensions about state protectionism has been frequently noted.972 A
later theme has been that the Framers desired to create a national
     968 91 U.S. at 282. In Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 31, 33

(1867), the Court suggested that congressional silence with regard to matters of “lo-
cal” concern may in some circumstances signify a willingness that the states regu-
late. These principles were further explained by Chief Justice Stone, writing for the
Court in Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U.S. 466, 479 n.1 (1939). “The
failure of Congress to regulate interstate commerce has generally been taken to sig-
nify a Congressional purpose to leave undisturbed the authority of the states to make
regulations affecting the commerce in matters of peculiarly local concern, but to with-
hold from them authority to make regulations affecting those phases of it which,
because of the need of a national uniformity, demand that their regulation, if any,
be prescribed by a single authority.” The fullest development of the “silence” ratio-
nale was not by the Court but by a renowned academic, Professor Dowling. Inter-
