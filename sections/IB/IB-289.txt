granted in the same Article of the Constitution ‘to make all Laws
which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the
foregoing Powers’, . . . the only question remaining is whether the
Renegotiation Act was a law ‘necessary and proper for carrying into
Execution’ the war powers of Congress and especially its power to
support armies.” 1585 In a footnote, it listed the Preamble, the Nec-
essary and Proper Clause, the provisions authorizing Congress to
lay taxes and provide for the common defense, to declare war, and
to provide and maintain a navy, together with the clause designat-
ing the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy,
as being “among the many other provisions implementing the Con-
gress and the President with powers to meet the varied demands
of war. . . .” 1586

Declaration of War
    In the early draft of the Constitution presented to the Conven-
tion by its Committee of Detail, Congress was empowered “to make
war.” 1587 Although there were solitary suggestions that the power
should better be vested in the President alone,1588 in the Senate
alone,1589 or in the President and the Senate,1590 the sentiment of
the Convention, as best we can determine from the limited notes of
the proceedings, was that the potentially momentous consequences
of initiating armed hostilities should be called up only by the con-
currence of the President and both Houses of Congress.1591 In con-
trast to the English system, the Framers did not want the wealth
and blood of the Nation committed by the decision of a single indi-
    1585  334 U.S. at 757–58.
    1586  334 U.S. at 755 n.3.

     1588 Mr. Butler favored “vesting the power in the President, who will have all

the requisite qualities, and will not make war but when the Nation will support it.”

     1589 Mr. Pinkney thought the House was too numerous for such deliberations

but that the Senate would be more capable of a proper resolution and more ac-
quainted with foreign affairs. Additionally, with the states equally represented in
the Senate, the interests of all would be safeguarded. Id.
     1590 Hamilton’s plan provided that the President was “to make war or peace,

with the advice of the senate . . . .” 1 id. at 300.
     1591 2 id., 318–319. In THE FEDERALIST, No. 69 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 465, Hamilton

notes: “[T]he President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United
States. In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the
king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it. It would amount to noth-
ing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces,
as first General and admiral of the confederacy; while that of the British king ex-
tends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies,—
all which, by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legisla-
ture.” (Emphasis in original). See also id. at No. 26, 164–171. Cf. C. BERDAHL, WAR
POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES ch. V (1921).
