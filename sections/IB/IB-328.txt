       the section requiring escaped slaves to be returned to their mas-
       ters, Art. IV, § 1, cl. 3, was held by Chief Justice Taney in Scott v.
       Sandford,1864 to show conclusively that such persons and their de-
       scendants were not embraced within the term “citizen” as used in
       the Constitution. Today this ruling is interesting only as an histori-
       cal curiosity.

    Clause 2. The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall
not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Inva-
sion the public Safety may require it.

                                         IN GENERAL
           This clause is the only place in the Constitution in which the
       Great Writ is mentioned, a strange fact in the context of the re-
       gard with which the right was held at the time the Constitution
       was written 1865 and stranger in the context of the role the right
       has come to play in the Supreme Court’s efforts to constitutionalize
       federal and state criminal procedure.1866
           Only the Federal Government and not the states, it has been
       held obliquely, is limited by the clause.1867 The issue that has al-
       ways excited critical attention is the authority in which the clause
       places the power to determine whether the circumstances warrant
       suspension of the privilege of the Writ.1868 The clause itself does
       not specify, and although most of the clauses of § 9 are directed at
       Congress not all of them are.1869 At the Convention, the first pro-
       posal of a suspending authority expressly vested “in the legisla-

           1864  60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 411 (1857).

            1867 Gasquet v. Lapeyre, 242 U.S. 367, 369 (1917).
            1868 In form, of course, clause 2 is a limitation of power, not a grant of power,

       and is in addition placed in a section of limitations. It might be argued, therefore,
       that the power to suspend lies elsewhere and that this clause limits that authority.
       This argument is opposed by the little authority there is on the subject. 3 M. FAR-
       RAND, THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 213 (Luther Martin ed., 1937);
       Ex parte Merryman, 17 Fed. Cas. 144, 148 (No. 9487) (C.C.D. Md. 1861); but cf. 3 J.
       ELLIOT, THE DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION OF THE FEDERAL
       CONSTITUTION 464 (Edmund Randolph, 2d ed. 1836). At the Convention, Gouverneur
       Morris proposed the language of the present clause: the first section of the clause,
       down to “unless” was adopted unanimously, but the second part, qualifying the pro-
       hibition on suspension was adopted over the opposition of three states. 2 M. FAR-
       RAND, op. cit., 438. It would hardly have been meaningful for those states opposing
       any power to suspend to vote against this language if the power to suspend were
       conferred elsewhere.
