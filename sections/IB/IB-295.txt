it dismissed the objection under that amendment as a contention
that was “refuted by its mere statement.” 1621
     Although the Supreme Court has so far formally declined to pass
on the question of the “peacetime” draft,1622 its opinions leave no
doubt of the constitutional validity of the act. In United States v.
O’Brien,1623 upholding a statute prohibiting the destruction of selec-
tive service registration certificates, the Court, speaking through Chief
Justice Warren, thought “[t]he power of Congress to classify and
conscript manpower for military service is ‘beyond question.’ ” 1624
In noting Congress’s “broad constitutional power” to raise and regu-
late armies and navies,1625 the Court has specifically observed that
the conscription act was passed “pursuant to” the grant of author-
ity to Congress in clauses 12–14.1626

Care of the Armed Forces
     Scope of the congressional and executive authority to prescribe
the rules for the governance of the military is broad and subject to
great deference by the judiciary. The Court recognizes “that the mili-
tary is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian so-
ciety,” that “[t]he military constitutes a specialized community gov-
erned by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,” and that
“Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and
with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules by which [mili-
tary society] shall be governed than it is when prescribing rules for
[civilian society].” 1627 Denying that Congress or military authori-
