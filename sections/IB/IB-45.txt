cerned the merely personal or private affairs of any individual.213
But, where the business, and the conduct of individuals are subject
to congressional regulation, there exists the power of inquiry,214 and
in practice the areas of any individual’s life immune from inquiry
are probably fairly limited. “In the decade following World War II,
there appeared a new kind of congressional inquiry unknown in prior
periods of American history. Principally this was the result of the
various investigations into the threat of subversion of the United
States Government, but other subjects of congressional interest also
contributed to the changed scene. This new phase of legislative in-
quiry involved a broad-scale intrusion into the lives and affairs of
private citizens.” 215 Because Congress clearly has the power to leg-
islate to protect the nation and its citizens from subversion, espio-
nage, and sedition,216 it also has the power to inquire into the exis-
tence of the dangers of domestic or foreign-based subversive activities
in many areas of American life, including education,217 labor and
industry,218 and political activity.219 Because its powers to regulate
interstate commerce afford Congress the power to regulate corrup-
tion in labor-management relations, congressional committees may
inquire into the extent of corruption in labor unions.220 Because of
its powers to legislate to protect the civil rights of its citizens, Con-
gress may investigate organizations which allegedly act to deny those
civil rights.221 It is difficult in fact to conceive of areas into which
congressional inquiry might not be carried, which is not the same,
of course, as saying that the exercise of the power is unlimited.
     One limitation on the power of inquiry that the cases have dis-
cussed concerns the contention that congressional investigations of-
ten have no legislative purpose but rather are aimed at achieving
results through “exposure” of disapproved persons and activities: “We
have no doubt,” wrote Chief Justice Warren, “that there is no con-

    214  The first case so holding is ICC v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447 (1894), which as-
serts that, because Congress could itself have made the inquiry to appraise its regu-
latory activities, it could delegate the power of inquiry to the agency to which it had
delegated the regulatory function.
