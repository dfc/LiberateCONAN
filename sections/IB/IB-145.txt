which combinations of employees engaged in such intrastate activi-
ties as manufacturing, mining, building, construction, and the dis-
tribution of poultry were subjected to the penalties of the Sherman
Act because of the effect or intended effect of their activities on in-
terstate commerce.787
    Stockyards and Grain Futures Acts.—In 1921, Congress passed
the Packers and Stockyards Act,788 whereby the business of commis-
sion men and livestock dealers in the chief stockyards of the coun-
try was brought under national supervision, and in the year follow-
ing it passed the Grain Futures Act,789 whereby exchanges dealing
in grain futures were subjected to control. The decisions of the Court
sustaining these measures both built directly upon the Swift case.
    In Stafford v. Wallace,790 which involved the former act, Chief
Justice Taft, speaking for the Court, said: “The object to be secured
by the act is the free and unburdened flow of livestock from the
ranges and farms of the West and Southwest through the great stock-
yards and slaughtering centers on the borders of that region, and
thence in the form of meat products to the consuming cities of the
country in the Middle West and East, or, still as livestock, to the
feeding places and fattening farms in the Middle West or East for
further preparation for the market.” 791 The stockyards, therefore,
were “not a place of rest or final destination.” They were “but a
throat through which the current flows,” and the sales there were
not “merely local transactions. . . . [T]hey do not stop the flow . . .
but, on the contrary, [are] indispensable to its continuity.” 792
    In Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen,793 involving the Grain Fu-
tures Act, the same course of reasoning was repeated. Speaking of
Swift, Chief Justice Taft remarked: “That case was a milestone in
the interpretation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. It rec-
ognized the great changes and development in the business of this
vast country and drew again the dividing line between interstate
and intrastate commerce where the Constitution intended it to be.
