                               EX POST FACTO LAWS

Definition
     Both federal and state governments are prohibited from enact-
ing ex post facto laws,1904 and the Court applies the same analysis
whether the law in question is a federal or a state enactment. When
these prohibitions were adopted as part of the original Constitu-
tion, many persons understood the term ex post facto laws to “em-
brace all retrospective laws, or laws governing or controlling past
transactions, whether . . . of a civil or a criminal nature.” 1905 But
in the early case of Calder v. Bull,1906 the Supreme Court decided
that the phrase, as used in the Constitution, was a term of art that
applied only to penal and criminal statutes. But, although it is in-
applicable to retroactive legislation of any other kind,1907 the consti-
tutional prohibition may not be evaded by giving a civil form to a
measure that is essentially criminal.1908 Every law that makes crimi-
nal an act that was innocent when done, or that inflicts a greater
punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed, is
an ex post facto law within the prohibition of the Constitution.1909
A prosecution under a temporary statute that was extended before
the date originally set for its expiration does not offend this provi-
sion even though it is instituted subsequent to the extension of the
statute’s duration for a violation committed prior thereto.1910 Be-
cause this provision does not apply to crimes committed outside the
jurisdiction of the United States against the laws of a foreign coun-
try, it is immaterial in extradition proceedings whether the foreign
law is ex post facto or not.1911

What Constitutes Punishment
    The issue of whether a law is civil or punitive in nature is es-
sentially the same for ex post facto and for double jeopardy analy-
