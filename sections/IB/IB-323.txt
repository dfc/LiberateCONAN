Definition of Punishment and Crimes
     Although the only crimes which Congress is expressly autho-
rized to punish are piracies, felonies on the high seas, offenses against
the law of nations, treason and counterfeiting of the securities and
current coin of the United States, its power to create, define, and
punish crimes and offenses whenever necessary to effectuate the ob-
jects of the Federal Government is universally conceded.1826 Illus-
trative of the offenses which have been punished under this power
are the alteration of registered bonds,1827 the bringing of counter-
feit bonds into the country,1828 conspiracy to injure prisoners in cus-
tody of a United States marshal,1829 impersonation of a federal offi-
cer with intent to defraud,1830 conspiracy to injure a citizen in the
free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by the
Constitution or laws of the United States,1831 the receipt by govern-
ment officials of contributions from government employees for politi-
cal purposes,1832 and advocating the overthrow of the government
by force.1833 Part I of Title 18 of the United States Code comprises
more than 500 sections defining penal offenses against the United
States.1834
    One of the most expansive interpretations of the Necessary and

     1826 United States v. Fox, 95 U.S. 670, 672 (1878); United States v. Hall, 98 U.S.

343, 357 (1879); United States v. Worrall, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 384, 394 (1798); Mc-
Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). That this power has been freely
exercised is attested by the pages of the United States Code devoted to Title 18,
entitled “Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure.” In addition, numerous regulatory
measures in other titles prescribe criminal penalties.
