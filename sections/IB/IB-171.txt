basis” to believe that diversion of medicinal marijuana into the ille-
gal market would depress the price on the latter market.922 The
Court also had little trouble finding that, even in application to me-
dicinal marijuana, the CSA was an economic regulation. Noting that
the definition of “economics” includes “the production, distribution,
and consumption of commodities,” 923 the Court found that prohibit-
ing the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of com-
merce is a rational and commonly used means of regulating com-
merce in that product.
     The Court’s decision also contained an intertwined but poten-
tially separate argument that Congress had ample authority under
the Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate the intrastate manu-
facture and possession of controlled substances, because failure to
regulate these activities would undercut the ability of the govern-
ment to enforce the CSA generally.924 The Court quoted language
from Lopez that appears to authorize the regulation of such activi-
ties on the basis that they are an essential part of a regulatory
scheme.925 Justice Scalia, in concurrence, suggested that this latter
category of activities could be regulated under the Necessary and
Proper Clause regardless of whether the activity in question was
economic or whether it substantially affected interstate com-
merce.926
     Activity Versus Inactivity.—In National Federation of Inde-
pendent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius,927 the Court held that Con-
gress did not have the authority under the Commerce Clause to im-
pose a requirement compelling certain individuals to maintain a
minimum level of health insurance (although, as discussed previ-
ously, the Court found such power to exist under the taxing power).
Under this “individual mandate,” failure to purchase health insur-
ance may subject a person to a monetary penalty, administered through
the tax code.928 By requiring that individuals purchase health in-
surance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by those who would oth-

This mandate was necessitated by the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “community-
rating” provisions, under which insurance companies are prohibited from denying
coverage to those with such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher pre-
miums than healthy individuals. Id. at §§ 300gg, 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4. As these
requirements provide an incentive for individuals to delay purchasing health insur-
ance until they become sick, this would impose new costs on insurers, leading them
to significantly increase premiums on everyone.
