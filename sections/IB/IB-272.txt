Exclusive Power as an Adjunct to Other Powers
     The cases just reviewed involved attempts to close the mails to
communication that were deemed to be harmful. A much broader
power of exclusion was asserted in the Public Utility Holding Com-
pany Act of 1935.1478 To induce compliance with the regulatory re-
quirements of that act, Congress denied the privilege of using the
mails for any purpose to holding companies that failed to obey that
law, irrespective of the character of the material to be carried. View-
ing the matter realistically, the Supreme Court treated this provi-
sion as a penalty. Although it held this statute constitutional be-
cause the regulations whose infractions were thus penalized were
themselves valid,1479 it declared that “Congress may not exercise
its control over the mails to enforce a requirement which lies out-
side its constitutional province. . . .” 1480

State Regulations Affecting the Mails
     In determining the extent to which state laws may impinge upon
persons or corporations whose services are used by Congress in ex-
ecuting its postal powers, the task of the Supreme Court has been
to determine whether particular measures are consistent with the
general policies indicated by Congress. Broadly speaking, the Court
has approved regulations having a trivial or remote relation to the
operation of the postal service, while disallowing those constituting
a serious impediment to it. Thus, a state statute, which granted to
one company an exclusive right to operate a telegraph business in
the state, was found to be incompatible with a federal law, which,
in granting to any telegraph company the right to construct its lines
upon post roads, was interpreted as a prohibition of state monopo-
lies in a field Congress was entitled to regulate in the exercise of
its combined power over commerce and post roads.1481
    An Illinois statute that, as construed by the state courts, re-
quired an interstate mail train to make a detour of seven miles in
order to stop at a designated station, also was held to be an uncon-
stitutional interference with the power of Congress under this
clause.1482 But a Minnesota statute requiring intrastate trains to
stop at county seats was found to be unobjectionable.1483
