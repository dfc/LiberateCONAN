    Regulation.—Much more diverse were the cases dealing with
regulation by the state and local governments. Taxation was one
thing, the myriad approaches and purposes of regulations another.
Generally speaking, if the state action was perceived by the Court
to be a regulation of interstate commerce itself, it was deemed to
impose a “direct” burden on interstate commerce and impermis-
sible. If the Court saw it as something other than a regulation of
interstate commerce, it was considered only to “affect” interstate com-
merce or to impose only an “indirect” burden on it in the proper
exercise of the police powers of the states.1022 But the distinction
between “direct” and “indirect” burdens was often perceptible only
to the Court.1023
    A corporation’s status as a foreign entity did not immunize it
from state requirements, conditioning its admission to do a local
business, to obtain a local license, and to furnish relevant informa-
tion as well as to pay a reasonable fee.1024 But no registration was
permitted of an out-of-state corporation, the business of which in
the host state was purely interstate in character.1025 Neither did
the Court permit a state to exclude from its courts a corporation
engaging solely in interstate commerce because of a failure to reg-
ister and to qualify to do business in that state.1026
     Interstate transportation brought forth hundreds of cases. State
regulation of trains operating across state lines resulted in diver-
gent rulings. It was early held improper for states to prescribe charges
for transportation of persons and freight on the basis that the regu-

be an interstate activity. E.g., Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U.S. 80 (1948);
General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U.S. 436 (1964); Standard Pressed Steel
Co. v. Department of Revenue, 419 U.S. 560 (1975).
     1022 Sedler, The Negative Commerce Clause as a Restriction on State Regulation

and Taxation: An Analysis in Terms of Constitutional Structure, 31 WAYNE L. REV.
885, 924–925 (1985). In addition to the sources already cited, see the Court’s summa-
ries in The Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), 230 U.S. 352, 398–412 (1913),
and Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761, 766–70 (1945). In the latter case,
Chief Justice Stone was reconceptualizing the standards under the clause, but the
summary represents a faithful recitation of the law.
     1023 See Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U.S. 34 (1927) (Justice Stone dissenting).

The dissent was the precursor to Chief Justice Stone’s reformulation of the stan-
dard in 1945. DiSanto was overruled in California v. Thompson, 313 U.S. 109 (1941).
     1024 Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519 (1839); Hanover Fire Ins.

Co. v. Harding, 272 U.S. 494 (1926); Union Brokerage Co. v. Jensen, 322 U.S. 202
(1944).
     1025 Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47 (1891); International Textbook Co. v. Pigg,

217 U.S. 91 (1910).
     1026 Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U.S. 282 (1921); Allenberg Cotton Co.

v. Pittman, 419 U.S. 20 (1974). But see Eli Lilly & Co. v. Sav-on Drugs, 366 U.S.
276 (1961).
