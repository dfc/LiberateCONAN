comport with the spirit of the powers vested in them in relation to
this subject.” 1394 Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has ever
accepted this limited view. The first bankruptcy law, passed in 1800,
departed from the English practice to the extent of including bank-
ers, brokers, factors, and underwriters as well as traders.1395 Assert-
ing that the narrow scope of the English statutes was a mere mat-
ter of policy, which by no means entered into the nature of such
laws, Justice Story defined bankruptcy legislation in the sense of
the Constitution as a law making provisions for cases of persons
failing to pay their debts.1396
     This interpretation has been ratified by the Supreme Court. In
Hanover National Bank v. Moyses,1397 it held valid the Bankruptcy
Act of 1898, which provided that persons other than traders might
become bankrupts and that this might be done on voluntary peti-
tion. The Court has given tacit approval to the extension of the bank-
ruptcy laws to cover practically all classes of persons and corpora-
tions,1398 including even municipal corporations 1399 and wage-
earning individuals. The Bankruptcy Act has, in fact been amended
to provide a wage-earners’ extension plan to deal with the unique
problems of debtors who derive their livelihood primarily from sala-
ries or commissions. In furthering the implementation of this plan,
the Supreme Court has held that a wage earner may make use of
it, notwithstanding the fact he has been previously discharged in
bankruptcy within the last six years.1400

Liberalization of Relief Granted and Expansion of the
  Rights of the Trustee
    As the coverage of the bankruptcy laws has been expanded, the
scope of the relief afforded to debtors has been correspondingly en-
larged. The act of 1800, like its English antecedents, was designed
primarily for the benefit of creditors. Beginning with the act of 1841,
which opened the door to voluntary petitions, rehabilitation of the
debtor has become an object of increasing concern to Congress. An
adjudication in bankruptcy is no longer requisite to the exercise of
bankruptcy jurisdiction. In 1867, the debtor for the first time was
permitted, either before or after adjudication of bankruptcy, to pro-
pose terms of composition that would become binding upon accep-
