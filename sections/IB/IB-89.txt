       Appointment to Executive Office
           “The reasons for excluding persons from offices, who have been
       concerned in creating them, or increasing their emoluments, are to
       take away, as far as possible, any improper bias in the vote of the
       representative, and to secure to the constituents some solemn pledge
       of his disinterestedness. The actual provision, however, does not go
       to the extent of the principle; for his appointment is restricted only
       ‘during the time, for which he was elected’; thus leaving in full force
       every influence upon his mind, if the period of his election is short,
       or the duration of it is approaching its natural termination.” 467 As
       might be expected, there is no judicial interpretation of the lan-
       guage of the clause and indeed it has seldom surfaced as an issue.
           In 1909, after having increased the salary of the Secretary of
       State,468 Congress reduced it to the former figure so that a Mem-
       ber of the Senate at the time the increase was voted would be eli-
       gible for that office.469 The clause became a subject of discussion in
       1937, when Justice Black was appointed to the Court, because Con-
       gress had recently increased the amount of pension available to Jus-
       tices retiring at seventy and Black’s Senate term had still some time
       to run. The appointment was defended, however, with the argu-
       ment that, because Black was only fifty-one at the time, he would
       be ineligible for the “increased emolument” for nineteen years and
       it was not as to him an increased emolument.470 In 1969, it was
       briefly questioned whether a Member of the House of Representa-
       tives could be appointed Secretary of Defense because, under a sal-
       ary bill enacted in the previous Congress, the President would pro-
       pose a salary increase, including that of cabinet officers, early in
           467  2 J. STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUITON OF THE UNITED STATES § 864 (1833).
           468  34 Stat. 948 (1907).
            469 35 Stat. 626 (1909). Congress followed this precedent when the President

       wished to appoint a Senator as Attorney General and the salary had been increased
       pursuant to a process under which Congress did not need to vote to approve but
       could vote to disapprove. The salary was temporarily reduced to its previous level.

       of the Federal Maritime Commission in order to qualify a Representative).
            470 The matter gave rise to a case, Ex parte Albert Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937),

       in which the Court declined to pass upon the validity of Justice Black’s appoint-
       ment. The Court denied the complainant standing, but strangely it did not advert
       to the fact that it was being asked to assume original jurisdiction contrary to Marbury
       v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cr.) 137 (1803).
