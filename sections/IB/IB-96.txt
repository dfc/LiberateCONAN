Presentation of Resolutions
    The purpose of clause 3, the Orders, Resolutions, and Votes Clause
(ORV Clause), is not readily apparent. For years it was assumed
that the Framers inserted the clause to prevent Congress from evad-
ing the veto clause by designating as something other than a bill
measures intended to take effect as laws.507 Why a separate clause
was needed for this purpose has not been explained. Recent schol-
arship presents a different possible explanation for the ORV Clause—
that it was designed to authorize delegation of lawmaking power to
a single House, subject to presentment, veto, and possible two-
House veto override.508 If construed literally, the clause could have
bogged down the intermediate stages of the legislative process, and
Congress made practical adjustments. At the request of the Sen-
ate, the Judiciary Committee in 1897 published a comprehensive
report detailing how the clause had been interpreted over the years.
Briefly, it was shown that the word “necessary” in the clause had
come to refer to the necessity for law-making; that is, any “order,
resolution, or vote” must be submitted if it is to have the force of
law. But “votes” taken in either House preliminary to the final pas-
sage of legislation need not be submitted to the other House or to
the President, nor must concurrent resolutions merely expressing
the views or “sense” of the Congress.509
    Although the ORV Clause excepts only adjournment resolu-
tions and makes no explicit reference to resolutions proposing con-
stitutional amendments, the practice and understanding, begin-
ning with the Bill of Rights, has been that resolutions proposing
constitutional amendments need not be presented to the President
for veto or approval. Hollingsworth v. Virginia,510 in which the Court
rejected a challenge to the validity of the Eleventh Amendment based
on the assertion that it had not been presented to the President, is
