facilities were available to treat nuclear wastes, because “eco-
nomic” regulation of power generation has traditionally been left to
the states—an arrangement maintained by the Act—and because
the state law could be justified as an economic rather than a safety
regulation.1190
     A city’s effort to enforce stiff penalties for ship pollution that
resulted from boilers approved by the Federal Government was held
not preempted, the field of boiler safety, but not boiler pollution,
having been occupied by federal regulation.1191 A state liability scheme
imposing cleanup costs and strict, no-fault liability on shore facili-
ties and ships for any oil-spill damage was held to complement a
federal law concerned solely with recovery of actual cleanup costs
incurred by the Federal Government and which textually presup-
posed federal-state cooperation.1192 On the other hand, a comprehen-
sive regulation of the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in
Puget Sound was found, save in one respect, to be either expressly
or implicitly preempted by federal law and regulations. Critical to
the determination was the Court’s conclusion that Congress, with-
out actually saying so, had intended to mandate exclusive stan-
dards and a single federal decisionmaker for safety purposes in ves-
sel regulation.1193 Also, a closely divided Court voided a city ordinance
placing an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew on jet flights from the city air-
port where, despite the absence of preemptive language in federal
law, federal regulation of aircraft noise was of such a pervasive na-
ture as to leave no room for state or local regulation.1194

Neither does the same reservation of exclusive authority to regulate nuclear safety
preempt imposition of punitive damages under state tort law, even if based upon
the jury’s conclusion that a nuclear licensee failed to follow adequate safety precau-
tions. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238 (1984). See also English v. Gen-
eral Electric Co., 496 U.S. 72 (1990) (employee’s state-law claim for intentional in-
fliction of emotional distress for her nuclear-plant employer’s actions retaliating for
her whistleblowing is not preempted as relating to nuclear safety).
