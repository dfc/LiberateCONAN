       proportion to population in the District of Columbia.1954 A penalty
       imposed for nonpayment of a direct tax is not a part of the tax it-
       self and hence is not subject to the rule of apportionment. Accord-
       ingly, the Supreme Court sustained the penalty of fifty percent, which
       Congress exacted for default in the payment of the direct tax on
       land in the aggregate amount of twenty million dollars that was
       levied and apportioned among the states during the Civil War.1955

    Clause 5. No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported
from any State.
                                TAXES ON EXPORTS
           The prohibition on excise taxes applies only to the imposition
       of duties on goods by reason of exportation.1956 The word “export”
       signifies goods exported to a foreign country, not to an unincorpo-
       rated territory of the United States.1957 A general tax laid on all
       property alike, including that intended for export, is not within the
       prohibition, if it is not levied on goods in course of exportation nor
       because of their intended exportation.1958
           Continuing its refusal to modify its export clause jurispru-
       dence,1959 the Court held unconstitutional the Harbor Maintenance
       Tax (HMT) under the export clause insofar as the tax was applied
       to goods loaded at United States ports for export. The HMT re-
       quired shippers to pay a uniform charge on commercial cargo shipped
       through the Nation’s ports. The clause, said the Court, “categori-
       cally bars Congress from imposing any tax on exports.” 1960 How-
       ever, the clause does not interdict a “user fee,” which is a charge
       that lacks the attributes of a generally applicable tax or duty and
       is designed to compensate for government supplied services, facili-
       ties, or benefits; and it was that defense to which the government
       repaired once it failed to obtain a modification of the rules under
       the clause. But the HMT bore the indicia of a tax. It was titled as
       a tax, described as a tax in the law, and codified in the Internal
       Revenue Code. Aside from labels, however, courts must look to how
       things operate, and the HMT did not qualify as a user fee. It did
       not represent compensation for services rendered. The value of ex-
