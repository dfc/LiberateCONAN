    Less than a year after the ruling in United States v. South-
Eastern Underwriters Ass’n 992 that insurance transactions across state
lines constituted interstate commerce, thereby establishing their im-
munity from discriminatory state taxation, Congress passed the
McCarran-Ferguson Act,993 authorizing state regulation and taxa-
tion of the insurance business. In Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benja-
min,994 the Court sustained a South Carolina statute that imposed
on foreign insurance companies, as a condition of their doing busi-
ness in the state, an annual tax of three percent of premiums from
business done in South Carolina, while imposing no similar tax on
local corporations. “Obviously,” said Justice Rutledge for the Court,
“Congress’s purpose was broadly to give support to the existing and
future state systems for regulating and taxing the business of insur-
ance. This was done in two ways. One was by removing obstruc-
tions which might be thought to flow from its own power, whether
dormant or exercised, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Act itself or in future legislation. The other was by declaring ex-
pressly and affirmatively that continued state regulation and taxa-
tion of this business is in the public interest and that the business
and all who engage in it ‘shall be subject to’ the laws of the several
states in these respects.” 995
    Justice Rutledge continued: “The power of Congress over com-
merce exercised entirely without reference to coordinated action of
the states is not restricted, except as the Constitution expressly pro-
vides, by any limitation which forbids it to discriminate against in-
terstate commerce and in favor of local trade. Its plenary scope en-
ables Congress not only to promote but also to prohibit interstate
commerce, as it has done frequently and for a great variety of rea-
sons. . . . This broad authority Congress may exercise alone, sub-
ject to those limitations, or in conjunction with coordinated action
by the states, in which case limitations imposed for the preserva-
tion of their powers become inoperative and only those designed to
