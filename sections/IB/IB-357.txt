contracts still awaiting performance—but this implication was re-
jected early on for a certain class of contracts, with immensely im-
portant result for the clause.
    “Impair” Defined.—“The obligations of a contract,” said Chief
Justice Hughes for the Court in Home Building & Loan Ass’n v.
Blaisdell,2063 “are impaired by a law which renders them invalid,
or releases or extinguishes them . . . , and impairment . . . has been
predicated upon laws which without destroying contracts derogate
from substantial contractual rights.” 2064 But he adds: “Not only are
existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as be-
tween the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sov-
ereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal
order. The policy of protecting contracts against impairment presup-
poses the maintenance of a government by virtue of which contrac-
tual relations are worthwhile,—a government which retains ad-
equate authority to secure the peace and good order of society. This
principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the nec-
essary residuum of state power has had progressive recognition in
the decisions of this Court.” 2065 In short, the law from which the
obligation stems must be understood to include constitutional law
and, moreover a “progressive” constitutional law.2066
    Vested Rights Not Included.—The term “contracts” is used in
the Contract Clause in its popular sense of an agreement of minds.
The clause therefore does not protect vested rights that are not re-
ferable to such an agreement between the state and an individual,
such as the right of recovery under a judgment. The individual in
question may have a case under the Fourteenth Amendment, but
not one under Article I, § 10.2067
     Public Grants That Are Not “Contracts”.—Not all grants by
a state constitute “contracts” within the sense of Article I, § 10. In
his Dartmouth College decision, Chief Justice Marshall conceded that
“if the act of incorporation be a grant of political power, if it cre-
ates a civil institution, to be employed in the administration of the
    2063 290 U.S. 398 (1934).
    2064 290 U.S. at 431.
    2065 290 U.S. at 435. See also City of El Paso v. Simmons, 379 U.S. 497 (1965).
    2066 “The Blaisdell decision represented a realistic appreciation of the fact that

ours is an evolving society and that the general words of the contract clause were
not intended to reduce the legislative branch of government to helpless impotency.”
Justice Black, in Wood v. Lovett, 313 U.S. 362, 383 (1941).
    2067 Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U.S. 142, 145–46 (1922); Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v.

Mayor of New Orleans, 109 U.S. 285, 288 (1883); Morley v. Lake Shore Ry., 146
U.S. 162, 169 (1892). That the Contract Clause did not protect vested rights merely
as such was stated by the Court as early as Satterlee v. Matthewson, 27 U.S. (2
Pet.) 380, 413 (1829); and again in Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 36 U.S.
(11 Pet.) 420, 539–40 (1837).
