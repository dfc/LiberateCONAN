places and routes those that should serve as post offices and post
roads? As late as 1855, Justice McLean stated that this power “has
generally been considered as exhausted in the designation of roads
on which the mails are to be transported,” and concluded that nei-
ther under the commerce power nor the power to establish post roads
could Congress construct a bridge over a navigable water.1458 A de-
cade earlier, however, the Court, without passing upon the validity
of the original construction of the Cumberland Road, held that be-
ing “charged . . . with the transportation of the mails,” Congress
could enter a valid compact with the State of Pennsylvania regard-
ing the use and upkeep of the portion of the road lying in the state.1459
The debate on the question was terminated in 1876 by the decision
in Kohl v. United States,1460 sustaining a proceeding by the United
States to appropriate a parcel of land in Cincinnati as a site for a
post office and courthouse.

Power To Protect the Mails
     The postal powers of Congress embrace all measures necessary
to insure the safe and speedy transit and prompt delivery of the
mails.1461 And not only are the mails under the protection of the
National Government, they are in contemplation of law its prop-
erty. This principle was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1845
in holding that wagons carrying United States mail were not sub-
ject to a state toll tax imposed for use of the Cumberland Road pur-
suant to a compact with the United States.1462 Half a century later
it was availed of as one of the grounds on which the national execu-
tive was conceded the right to enter the national courts and de-
mand an injunction against the authors of any widespread disor-
der interfering with interstate commerce and the transmission of
the mails.1463
     Prompted by the efforts of Northern anti-slavery elements to dis-
seminate their propaganda in the Southern states through the mails,
President Jackson, in his annual message to Congress in 1835, sug-
gested “the propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under
severe penalties, the circulation in the Southern States, through the

payment of a fee (postage), a letterbox which has been designated an “authorized
depository” of the mail by the Postal Service.
