quently cited passage from the Court’s opinion in Gilman v. Phila-
delphia.715 “Commerce includes navigation. The power to regulate
commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the ex-
tent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which
are accessible from a State other than those in which they lie. For
this purpose they are the public property of the nation, and subject
to all requisite legislation by Congress. This necessarily includes
the power to keep them open and free from any obstruction to their
navigation, interposed by the States or otherwise; to remove such
obstructions when they exist; and to provide, by such sanctions as
they may deem proper, against the occurrence of the evil and for
the punishment of offenders. For these purposes, Congress pos-
sesses all the powers which existed in the States before the adop-
tion of the national Constitution, and which have always existed in
the Parliament in England.” 716
    Thus, Congress was within its powers in vesting the Secretary
of War with power to determine whether a structure of any nature
in or over a navigable stream is an obstruction to navigation and
to order its abatement if he so finds.717 Nor is the United States
required to compensate the owners of such structures for their loss,
since they were always subject to the servitude represented by Con-
gress’s powers over commerce, and the same is true of the property
of riparian owners that is damaged.718 And while it was formerly
held that lands adjoining nonnavigable streams were not subject to
the above mentioned servitude,719 this rule has been impaired by

Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U.S. 177 (1910); Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U.S. 367
(1929). The United States may seek injunctive or declaratory relief requiring the
removal of obstructions to commerce by those negligently responsible for them or it
may itself remove the obstructions and proceed against the responsible party for
costs. United States v. Republic Steel Corp., 362 U.S. 482 (1960); Wyandotte Trans-
portation Co. v. United States, 389 U.S. 191 (1967). Congress’s power in this area is
newly demonstrated by legislation aimed at pollution and environmental degrada-
tion. In confirming the title of the states to certain waters under the Submerged
Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29 (1953), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1301 et seq., Congress was careful to
retain authority over the waters for purposes of commerce, navigation, and the like.
