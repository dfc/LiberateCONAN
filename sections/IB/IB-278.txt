of patentability, however, the Court, rather than Congress, will be
doing the ultimate weighing. As for the clarity of the patentability
standard, the three-fold test of utility, novelty and advancement seems
to have been made less clear by the Supreme Court’s rejuvenation
of “invention” as a standard of patentability.1517

Procedure in Issuing Patents
    The standard of patentability is a constitutional standard, and
the question of the validity of a patent is a question of law.1518 Con-
gress may authorize the issuance of a patent for an invention by a
special, as well as by general, law, provided the question as to whether
the patentee’s device is in truth an invention is left open to investi-
gation under the general law.1519 The function of the Commissioner
of Patents in issuing letters patent is deemed to be quasi-judicial
in character. Hence an act granting a right of appeal from the Com-
mission to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is not
unconstitutional as conferring executive power upon a judicial body.1520
The primary responsibility, however, for weeding out unpatentable
devices rests in the Patent Office.1521 The present system of “de novo”
hearings before the Court of Appeals allows the applicant to pres-
ent new evidence that the Patent Office has not heard,1522 thus mak-
ing somewhat amorphous the central responsibility.

Nature and Scope of the Right Secured for Copyright
   The leading case on the nature of the rights that Congress is
authorized to “secure” under the Copyright and Patent Clause is
Wheaton v. Peters.1523 Wheaton was the official reporter for the Su-
preme Court from 1816 to 1827, and Peters was his successor in
    1517 Anderson’s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage Co., 396 U.S. 57 (1969).

“The question of invention must turn on whether the combination supplied the key
requirement.” Id. at 60. But the Court also appeared to apply the test of nonobvious-
ness in the same decision: “We conclude that the combination was reasonably obvi-
ous to one with ordinary skill in the art.” Id. See also McClain v. Ortmayer, 141
U.S. 419, 427 (1891), where, speaking of the use of “invention” as a standard of pat-
entability the Court said: “The truth is the word cannot be defined in such manner
as to afford any substantial aid in determining whether a particular device involves
an exercise of the inventive faculty or not.”
    1518 A. & P. Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147 (1950); Mahn

v. Harwood, 112 U.S. 354, 358 (1884). In Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,
517 U.S. 348 (1996), the Court held that the interpretation of terms in a patent
claim is a matter of law reserved entirely for the courts. The Seventh Amendment
does not require that such issues be tried to a jury.
    1519 Evans v. Eaton, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 454, 512 (1818).
    1520 United States v. Duell, 172 U.S. 576, 586–89 (1899). See also Butterworth

v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U.S. 50 (1884).
    1521 Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 18 (1966).
    1522 In Jennings v. Brenner, 255 F. Supp. 410, 412 (D.D.C. 1966), District Judge

Holtzoff suggested that a system of remand be adopted.
    1523 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834).
