discriminated between privately issued bonds.1107 In what may por-
tend a significant change in dormant commerce clause doctrine, how-
ever, the Court declined to evaluate the governmental benefits of
Kentucky’s tax scheme versus the economic burdens it imposed, hold-
ing that, at least in this instance, the “Judicial Branch is not insti-
tutionally suited to draw reliable conclusions.” 1108
     Drawing the line between regulations that are facially discrimi-
natory and regulations that necessitate balancing is not an easy task.
Not every claim of unconstitutional protectionism has been sus-
tained. Thus, in Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,1109 the Court
upheld a state law banning the retail sale of milk products in plas-
tic, nonreturnable containers but permitting sales in other nonre-
turnable, nonrefillable containers, such as paperboard cartons. The
Court found no discrimination against interstate commerce, be-
cause both in-state and out-of-state interests could not use plastic
containers, and it refused to credit a lower, state-court finding that
the measure was intended to benefit the local pulpwood industry.
In Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland,1110 the Court upheld a stat-
ute that prohibited producers or refiners of petroleum products from
operating retail service stations in Maryland. The statute did not
on its face discriminate against out-of-state companies, but, as there
were no producers or refiners in Maryland, “the burden of the dives-
titure requirements” fell solely on such companies.1111 The Court found,
however, that “this fact does not lead, either logically or as a prac-
tical matter, to a conclusion that the State is discriminating against
interstate commerce at the retail level,” 1112 as the statute does not
“distinguish between in-state and out-of-state companies in the re-
tail market.” 1113
    Still a model example of balancing is Chief Justice Stone’s opin-
ion in Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona.1114 At issue was the validity
     1107 128 S. Ct. at 1810–11. The Court noted that “[t]here is no forbidden discrimi-

nation because Kentucky, as a public entity, does not have to treat itself as being
‘substantially similar’ to the other bond issuers in the market.” Id. at 1811. Three
members of the Court would have also found this taxation scheme constitutional
under the “market participant” doctrine, despite the argument that the state, in this
instance, was acting as a market regulator, not as a market participant. Id. at 1812–14
(Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens and Breyer).

     1109 449 U.S. 456, 470–74 (1981).

the Court in South Carolina State Highway Dep’t v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U.S. 177
(1938), in which, in a similar case involving regulation of interstate transportation
and proffered safety reasons, he had eschewed balancing and deferred overwhelm-
