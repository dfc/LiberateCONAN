     Apportionment.—This requirement is of long standing,1064 but
its importance has broadened as the scope of the states’ taxing pow-
ers has enlarged. It is concerned with what formulas the states must
use to claim a share of a multistate business’ tax base for the tax-
ing state, when the business carries on a single integrated enter-
prise both within and without the state. A state may not exact from
interstate commerce more than the state’s fair share. Avoidance of
multiple taxation, or the risk of multiple taxation, is the test of an
apportionment formula. Generally speaking, this factor is both a Com-
merce Clause and a due process requisite, and it necessitates a ra-
tional relationship between the income attributed to the state and
the intrastate values of the enterprise.1065 The Court has declined
to impose any particular formula on the states, reasoning that to
do so would be to require the Court to engage in “extensive judicial
lawmaking,” for which it was ill-suited and for which Congress had
ample power and ability to legislate.1066
    “Instead,” the Court wrote, “we determine whether a tax is fairly
apportioned by examining whether it is internally and externally
consistent. To be internally consistent, a tax must be structured so
that if every State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple taxa-
tion would result. Thus, the internal consistency test focuses on the
text of the challenged statute and hypothesizes a situation where
other States have passed an identical statute. . . . The external con-
sistency test asks whether the State has taxed only that portion of
the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects
the in-state component of the activity being taxed. We thus exam-
