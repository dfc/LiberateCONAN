then, of course, Congress has authorized the Supreme Court to pre-
scribe rules of procedure for the lower federal courts.94
     Filling up the details of statutes has long been standard prac-
tice. For example, the Court upheld a statute requiring the manu-
facturers of oleomargarine to have their packages “marked, stamped
and branded as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue . . . shall
prescribe,” rejecting a contention that the prosecution was not for
violation of law but for violation of a regulation.95 “The criminal
offence,” said Chief Justice Fuller, “is fully and completely defined
by the act and the designation by the Commissioner of the particu-
lar marks and brands to be used was a mere matter of detail.” 96
Kollock was not the first such case,97 and it was followed by a mul-
titude of delegations that the Court sustained.98
     Contingent Legislation.—An entirely different problem arises
when, instead of directing another department of government to ap-
ply a general statute to individual cases, or to supplement it by de-
tailed regulation, the Congress passes contingent legislation. Un-
der such legislation, Congress commands that, upon the finding of
certain facts by an executive or administrative officer, a previously
enacted statute be revived, suspended, or modified, or that a new
rule be put into operation. Since the delegated function in such cases
is not that of “filling up the details” of a statute, authority for it
must be sought under some other theory.
     Contingent delegation was approved in an early case, The Brig
Aurora,99 upholding the revival of a law upon the issuance of a presi-
dential proclamation. After previous restraints on British shipping
had lapsed, Congress passed a new law stating that those restric-
tions should be renewed in the event the President found and pro-
claimed that France had abandoned certain practices that violated
    94 The power to promulgate rules of civil procedure was conferred by the Act of

June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064; the power to promulgate rules of criminal procedure
was conferred by the Act of June 29, 1940, 54 Stat. 688. These authorities are now
subsumed under 28 U.S.C. § 2072. In both instances Congress provided for submis-
sion of the rules to it, presumably reserving the power to change or to veto the rules.
Additionally, Congress has occasionally legislated rules itself. See, e.g., 82 Stat. 197
(1968), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3501–02 (admissibility of confessions in federal courts).

    98 In one such case, for example, the Court upheld an act directing the Secre-

tary of the Treasury to promulgate minimum standards of quality and purity for
tea imported into the United States. Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U.S. 470 (1904).

counting for carriers in interstate commerce).
