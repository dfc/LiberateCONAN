    The most far-reaching measure the Court has sustained is the
“loan-sharking” prohibition of the Consumer Credit Protection Act.949
The title affirmatively finds that extortionate credit transactions af-
fect interstate commerce because loan sharks are in a class largely
controlled by organized crime with a substantially adverse effect on
interstate commerce. Upholding the statute, the Court found that
though individual loan-sharking activities may be intrastate in na-
ture, still it is within Congress’s power to determine that it was
within a class the activities of which did affect interstate com-
merce, thus affording Congress power to regulate the entire class.950
   THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AS A RESTRAINT ON STATE
                    POWERS

Doctrinal Background
    The grant of power to Congress over commerce, unlike that of
power to levy customs duties, the power to raise armies, and some
others, is unaccompanied by correlative restrictions on state power.951
This circumstance does not, however, of itself signify that the states
were expected to participate in the power thus granted Congress,
subject only to the operation of the Supremacy Clause. As Hamil-
ton pointed out in The Federalist,952 while some of the powers that
are vested in the National Government admit of their “concurrent”
exercise by the states, others are of their very nature “exclusive,”
and hence render the notion of a like power in the states “contra-
dictory and repugnant.” As an example of the latter kind of power,
Hamilton mentioned the power of Congress to pass a uniform natu-
ralization law. Was the same principle expected to apply to the power
over foreign and interstate commerce?
    Unquestionably, one of the great advantages anticipated from
the grant to Congress of power over commerce was that state inter-
ferences with trade, which had become a source of sharp discon-

     951 Thus, by Article I, § 10, cl. 2, States are denied the power to “lay any Im-

posts or Duties on Imports or Exports” except by the consent of Congress. The clause
applies only to goods imported from or exported to another country, not from or to
another State, Woodruff v. Parham, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 123 (1869), which prevents its
application to interstate commerce, although Chief Justice Marshall thought to the
contrary, Brown v. Maryland, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419, 449 (1827), and the contrary
has been strongly argued. W. CROSSKEY, POLITICS AND THE CONSTITUTION IN THE HISTORY OF

with the discussion that follows, Hamilton avowed that the taxing power of the States,
save for imposts or duties on imports or exports, “remains undiminished.” Id. at 201.
