               DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER

Overview of the Doctrine of Nondelegability
    The Supreme Court has sometimes declared categorically that
“the legislative power of Congress cannot be delegated.” 51 On other
occasions, however, it has recognized more forthrightly, as Chief Jus-
tice Marshall did in 1825, that, although Congress may not del-
egate powers that “are strictly and exclusively legislative,” it may
delegate “powers which [it] may rightfully exercise itself.” 52 The for-
mer statement has never been literally true, the Court having up-
held the delegation at issue in the very case in which the state-
ment was made.53 The Court has long recognized that administration
of the law requires exercise of discretion,54 and that, “in our increas-
ingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more techni-
cal problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability
to delegate power under broad general directives.” 55 The real issue
is where to draw the line.
    Chief Justice Marshall recognized “that there is some difficulty
in discerning the exact limits,” and that “the precise boundary of
this power is a subject of delicate and difficult inquiry, into which a
court will not enter unnecessarily.” 56 Accordingly, the Court’s solu-
tion has been to reject delegation challenges in all but the most
extreme cases, and to accept delegations of vast powers to the Presi-
dent or to administrative agencies. With the exception of a brief
period in the 1930s when the Court was striking down New Deal
legislation on a variety of grounds, the Court has consistently up-
held grants of authority that have been challenged as invalid del-
egations of legislative power.

     51 United States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 85 (1932).

     52 Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 41 (1825).
     53 The Court in Shreveport Grain & Elevator upheld a delegation of authority

to the FDA to allow reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions from misbrand-
ing prohibitions that were backed by criminal penalties. It was “not open to reason-
able dispute” that such a delegation was permissible to fill in details “impracticable
for Congress to prescribe.”
     54 J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928) (“In de-

termining what [Congress] may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the
extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense
and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination”).
     55 Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989). See also Sunshine An-

thracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 398 (1940) (“Delegation by Congress has
long been recognized as necessary in order that the exertion of legislative power
does not become a futility”).
