    However, the Court found discriminatory and thus invalid a state
intangibles tax on a fraction of the value of corporate stock owned
by state residents inversely proportional to the state’s exposure to
the state income tax.1072
     Discrimination.—The “fundamental principle” governing this fac-
tor is simple. “ ‘No State may, consistent with the Commerce Clause,
impose a tax which discriminates against interstate commerce . . .
by providing a direct commercial advantage to local business.’ ” 1073
That is, a tax that by its terms or operation imposes greater bur-
dens on out-of-state goods or activities than on competing in-state
goods or activities will be struck down as discriminatory under the
Commerce Clause.1074 In Armco, Inc. v. Hardesty,1075 the Court voided
as discriminatory the imposition on an out-of-state wholesaler of a
state tax that was levied on manufacturing and wholesaling but that
relieved manufacturers subject to the manufacturing tax of liabil-
ity for paying the wholesaling tax. Even though the former tax was
higher than the latter, the Court found that the imposition discrimi-
nated against the interstate wholesaler.1076 A state excise tax on whole-
sale liquor sales, which exempted sales of specified local products,
was held to violate the Commerce Clause.1077 A state statute that
granted a tax credit for ethanol fuel if the ethanol was produced in
the state, or if it was produced in another state that granted a simi-
lar credit to the state’s ethanol fuel, was found discriminatory in

     1072 Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U.S. 325 (1996). The state had defended on

the basis that the tax was a “compensatory” one designed to make interstate com-
merce bear a burden already borne by intrastate commerce. The Court recognized
the legitimacy of the defense, but it found the tax to meet none of the three criteria
for classification as a valid compensatory tax. Id. at 333–44. See also South Central
Bell Tel. Co. v. Alabama, 526 U.S. 160 (1999) (tax not justified as compensatory).
     1073 Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U.S. 318, 329 (1977) (quot-

ing Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U.S. 450, 457 (1959)).
The principle, as we have observed above, is a long-standing one under the Com-
merce Clause. E.g., Welton v. Missouri, 91 U.S. 275 (1876).
     1074 Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 753–760 (1981). But see Common-

wealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609, 617–619 (1981). See also Oregon Waste
Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality, 511 U.S. 93 (1994) (sur-
charge on in-state disposal of solid wastes that discriminates against companies dis-
posing of waste generated in other states invalid).
     1075 467 U.S. 638 (1984).
     1076 The Court applied the “internal consistency” test here too, in order to deter-

mine the existence of discrimination. 467 U.S. at 644–45. Thus, the wholesaler did
not have to demonstrate it had paid a like tax to another state, only that if other
states imposed like taxes it would be subject to discriminatory taxation. See also
