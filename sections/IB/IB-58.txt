     The most important issue, of course, was how strict a standard
of equality the Court would adhere to. At first, the Justices seemed
inclined to some form of de minimis rule with a requirement that
the State present a principled justification for the deviations from
equality which any districting plan presented.291 But in Kirkpatrick
v. Preisler,292 a sharply divided Court announced the rule that a
state must make a “good-faith effort to achieve precise mathemati-
cal equality.” 293 Therefore, “[u]nless population variances among con-
gressional districts are shown to have resulted despite such [good-
faith] effort [to achieve precise mathematical equality], the state must
justify each variance, no matter how small.” 294 The strictness of the
test was revealed not only by the phrasing of the test but by the
fact that the majority rejected every proffer of a justification which
the state had made and which could likely be made. Thus, it was
not an adequate justification that deviations resulted from (1) an
effort to draw districts to maintain intact areas with distinct eco-
nomic and social interests,295 (2) the requirements of legislative com-
promise,296 (3) a desire to maintain the integrity of political subdi-
vision lines,297 (4) the exclusion from total population figures of certain
military personnel and students not residents of the areas in which
they were found,298 (5) an attempt to compensate for population shifts
since the last census,299 or (6) an effort to achieve geographical com-
pactness.300
     Illustrating the strictness of the standard, the Court upheld a
lower court voiding of a Texas congressional districting plan in which
the population difference between the most and least populous dis-
tricts was 19,275 persons and the average deviation from the ide-

U.S. 455 (1967), relying on the rule set out in Swann v. Adams, 385 U.S. 440 (1967),
a state legislative case.

Court, and it is the equality of individual voters that is protected.
     296 Id. Political “practicality” may not interfere with a rule of “practicable” equal-

ity.
     297 394 U.S. at 533–34. The argument is not “legally acceptable.”
     298 394 U.S. at 534–35. Justice Brennan questioned whether anything less than

a total population basis was permissible but noted that the legislature in any event
had made no consistent application of the rationale.
     299 394 U.S. at 535. This justification would be acceptable if an attempt to estab-

lish shifts with reasonable accuracy had been made.
     300 394 U.S. at 536. Justifications based upon “the unaesthetic appearance” of

the map will not be accepted.
