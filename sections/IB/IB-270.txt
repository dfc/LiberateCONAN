mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to
insurrection.” In the Senate, John C. Calhoun resisted this recom-
mendation, taking the position that it belonged to the States and
not to Congress to determine what is and what is not calculated to
disturb their security. He expressed the fear that if Congress might
determine what papers were incendiary, and as such prohibit their
circulation through the mail, it might also determine what were not
incendiary and enforce their circulation.1464 On this point his rea-
soning would appear to be vindicated by such decisions as those
denying the right of the states to prevent the importation of alco-
holic beverages from other states.1465

Power To Prevent Harmful Use of the Postal Facilities
    In 1872, Congress passed the first of a series of acts to exclude
from the mails publications designed to defraud the public or cor-
rupt its morals. In the pioneer case of Ex parte Jackson,1466 the Court
sustained the exclusion of circulars relating to lotteries on the gen-
eral ground that “the right to designate what shall be carried nec-
essarily involves the right to determine what shall be ex-
cluded.” 1467 The leading fraud order case, decided in 1904, held to
the same effect.1468 Pointing out that it is “an indispensable ad-
junct to a civil government,” to supply postal facilities, the Court
restated its premise that the “legislative body in thus establishing
a postal service may annex such conditions . . . as it chooses.” 1469
    Later cases first qualified these sweeping assertions and then
overturned them, holding government operation of the mails to be
subject to constitutional limitations. In upholding requirements that
publishers of newspapers and periodicals seeking second-class mail-
ing privileges file complete information regarding ownership, indebt-
edness, and circulation and that all paid advertisements in the pub-
lications be marked as such, the Court emphasized that these
provisions were reasonably designed to safeguard the second-class
privilege from exploitation by mere advertising publications.1470 Chief
Justice White warned that the Court by no means intended to im-
ply that it endorsed the Government’s “broad contentions concern-
ing . . . the classification of the mails, or by the way of condition
