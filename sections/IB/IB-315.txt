     Clause 17. Congress shall have power * * * To exercise ex-
clusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District
(not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particu-
lar States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of
Government of the United States, and to exercise like Author-
ity over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature
of the State in which the same shall be, for the Erection of Forts,
Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.

                              SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT
            The Convention was moved to provide for the creation of a site
        in which to locate the Capital of the Nation, completely removed
        from the control of any state, because of the humiliation suffered
        by the Continental Congress on June 21, 1783. Some eighty sol-
        diers, unpaid and weary, marched on the Congress sitting in Phila-
        delphia, physically threatened and verbally abused the members,
        and caused the Congress to flee the City when neither municipal
        nor state authorities would take action to protect the members.1766
        Thus, Madison noted that “[t]he indispensable necessity of com-
        plete authority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence
        with it. . . . Without it, not only the public authority might be in-
        sulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity, but a depen-
        dence of the members of the general government on the State com-
        prehending the seat of government, for protection in the exercise of
        their duty, might bring on the national council an imputation of awe
        or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatis-
        factory to the other members of the confederacy.” 1767
            The actual site was selected by compromise, Northerners accept-
        ing the Southern-favored site on the Potomac in return for South-
        ern support for a Northern aspiration, assumption of Revolution-
        ary War debts by the National Government.1768 Maryland and Virginia
