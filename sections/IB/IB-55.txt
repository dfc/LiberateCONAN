appropriate means of vindicating “the established and essential privi-
lege of requiring the production of evidence.” 272
    Under the rule laid down by Anderson v. Dunn,273 imprison-
ment by one of the Houses of Congress could not extend beyond
the adjournment of the body which ordered it. Because of this limi-
tation and because contempt trials before the bar of the House charg-
ing were time-consuming, in 1857 Congress enacted a statute pro-
viding for criminal process in the federal courts with prescribed
penalties for contempt of Congress.274
    The Supreme Court has held that the purpose of this statute is
merely supplementary of the power retained by Congress, and all
constitutional objections to it were overruled. “We grant that Con-
gress could not divest itself, or either of its Houses, of the essential
and inherent power to punish for contempt, in cases to which the
power of either House properly extended; but because Congress, by
the Act of 1857, sought to aid each of the Houses in the discharge
of its constitutional functions, it does not follow that any delega-
tion of the power in each to punish for contempt was involved.” 275
    Because Congress has invoked the aid of the federal judicial sys-
tem in protecting itself against contumacious conduct, the conse-
quence, the Court has asserted numerous times, is that the duty
has been conferred upon the federal courts to accord a person pros-
ecuted for his statutory offense every safeguard that the law ac-
cords in all other federal criminal cases,276 and the discussion in
previous sections of many reversals of contempt convictions bears
witness to the assertion in practice. What constitutional protec-
tions ordinarily necessitated by due process requirements, such as
notice, right to counsel, confrontation, and the like, prevail in a con-
tempt trial before the bar of one House or the other is an open ques-
tion.277

Court’s reversal of several contempt convictions over a period of years, Justice Clark
was moved to suggest that “[t]his continued frustration of the Congress in the use
of the judicial process to punish those who are contemptuous of its committees indi-
cates to me that the time may have come for Congress to revert to ‘its original prac-
tice of utilizing the coercive sanction of contempt proceedings at the bar of the House
[affected].’ ” Id. at 781; Watkins, 354 U.S. at 225.
