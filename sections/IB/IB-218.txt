State of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a
valid federal law, for the Framers of our Constitution provided that
the federal law must prevail.” 1156
    In the final analysis, “the generalities” that may be drawn from
the cases do not decide them. Rather, “the fate of state legislation
in these cases has not been determined by these generalities but
by the weight of the circumstances and the practical and experi-
enced judgment in applying these generalities to the particular in-
stances.” 1157
    The Standards Applied.—As might be expected from the ca-
veat just quoted, any overview of the Court’s preemption decisions
can only make the field seem tangled, and to some extent it is. But
some threads may be extracted.
    Express Preemption. Of course, it is possible for Congress to write
preemptive language that clearly and cleanly prescribes or does not
prescribe displacement of state laws in an area.1158 Provisions gov-
erning preemption can be relatively interpretation free.1159 For ex-
ample, a prohibition of state taxes on carriage of air passengers “or
ity opinion) (“[T]he text of the Clause—that federal law shall be supreme, ‘any Thing
in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding’—plainly
contemplates conflict pre-emption by describing federal law as effectively repealing
contrary state law.”).
      1156 Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663 (1962).
      1157 Union Brokerage Co. v. Jensen, 322 U.S. 202, 211 (1944) (per Justice Frank-

furter).
      1158 Regulations as well as statutes can preempt. Agency regulations, when Con-

gress has expressly or implied empowered these bodies to preempt, are “the su-
preme law of the land” and can displace state law. E.g., Smiley v. Citibank, 517
U.S. 735 (1996); City of New York v. FCC, 486 U.S. 57, 63–64 (1988); Louisiana Pub-
lic Service Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355 (1986); Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp,
467 U.S. 691 (1984); Fidelity Fed. Savings & Loan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S.
141 (1982). Federal common law, i.e., law applied by the courts in the absence of
explicit statutory directive, and respecting uniquely federal interests, can also dis-
place state law. See Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U.S. 500 (1988) (Su-
preme Court promulgated common-law rule creating government-contractor defense
in tort liability suits, despite Congress’s having considered and failed to enact bills
doing precisely this); Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.S. 292 (1988) (civil liability of federal
officials for actions taken in the course of their duty). Finally, ordinances of local
governments are subject to preemption under the same standards as state law.
Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, 471 U.S. 707 (1985).
      1159 Thus, § 408 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, as amended by the Whole-

some Meat Act, 21 U.S.C. § 678, provides that “[m]arking, labeling, packaging, or
ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those made under this chap-
ter may not be imposed by any state . . . .” See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S.
519, 528–32 (1977). See also National Meat Ass’n v. Harris, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–
224, slip op. (2012) (broad preemption of all state laws on slaughterhouse activi-
ties). Similarly, much state action is saved by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
15 U.S.C. § 78bb(a), which states that “[n]othing in this chapter shall affect the ju-
risdiction of the securities commissioner (or any agency or officer performing like
functions) of any State over any security or any person insofar as it does not con-
flict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.”
