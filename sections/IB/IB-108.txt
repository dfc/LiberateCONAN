tors.583 Under the Child Labor Tax Case,584 decided in 1922, the
Court, which had previously rejected a federal prohibition of child
labor laws as being outside of the Commerce Clause,585 also re-
jected a tax on companies using such labor. First, the Court noted
that the law in question set forth a specific and detailed regulatory
scheme—including the ages, industry, and number of hours allowed—
establishing when employment of underage youth would incur taxa-
tion. Second, the taxation in question functioned as a penalty, in
that it was set at one-tenth of net income per year, regardless of
the nature or degree of the infraction. Third, the tax had a scienter
requirement, so that the employer had to know that the child was
below a specified age in order to incur taxation. Fourth, the statute
made the businesses subject to inspection by officers of the Secre-
tary of Labor, positions not traditionally charged with the enforce-
ment and collection of taxes.
    More recently, in National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB) v. Sebelius,586 the Court upheld as an exercise of the taxing
authority a requirement under the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (ACA) 587 that mandates certain individuals to main-
tain a minimum level of health insurance. Failure to purchase health
insurance may subject a person to a monetary penalty, adminis-
tered through the tax code. Chief Justice Roberts, in a majority hold-
ing,588 used a functional approach in evaluating the authority for
the requirement, so that the use of the term “penalty” in the ACA 589
to describe the enforcement mechanism for the individual mandate
was found not to be determinative. The Court also found that the
latter three factors identified in the Child Labor Tax Case (penal
intent, scienter, enforcement by regulatory agency) were not pres-
ent with respect to the individual mandate. Unlike the child labor
taxation scheme, the tax level under the ACA is established based
on traditional tax variables such as taxable income, number of de-
pendents and joint filing status; there is no requirement of a know-
ing violation; and the tax is collected by the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice.
     The majority, however, did not appear to have addressed the
first Child Labor Case factor: whether the ACA set forth a specific
