its power to prescribe the terms and conditions on which they may
enter the United States, to establish regulations for sending out of
the country such aliens as have entered in violation of law, and to
commit the enforcement of such conditions and regulations to execu-
tive officers. It is not a power to lay down a special code of conduct
for alien residents or to govern their private relations.1370
    Yet Congress is empowered to assert a considerable degree of
control over aliens after their admission to the country. By the Alien
Registration Act of 1940, Congress provided that all aliens in the
United States, fourteen years of age and over, should submit to reg-
istration and finger printing and willful failure to comply was made
a criminal offense against the United States.1371 This Act, taken in
conjunction with other laws regulating immigration and naturaliza-
tion, has constituted a comprehensive and uniform system for the
regulation of all aliens.1372
    An important benefit of this comprehensive, uniform regulation
accruing to the alien is that it generally has precluded state regu-
lation that may well be more severe and burdensome.1373 For ex-
ample, in Hines v. Davidowitz,1374 the Court voided a Pennsylvania
law requiring the annual registration and fingerprinting of aliens
but going beyond the subsequently enacted federal law to require
acquisition of an alien identification card that had to be carried at

     1370 Purporting to enforce this distinction, the Court voided a statute, which, in

prohibiting the importation of “any alien woman or girl for the purpose of prostitu-
tion,” provided that whoever should keep for the purpose of prostitution “any alien
woman or girl within three years after she shall have entered the United States”
should be deemed guilty of a felony. Keller v. United States, 213 U.S. 138 (1909).

     1372 See Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 69–70 (1941).
     1373 In the 1990s, Congress began giving the states a larger role in the enforce-

ment of federal immigration law. During this period, Congress also broadened the
states’ authority to deny aliens state benefits. Still, in the 2000s, states increasingly
asserted greater independent authority to deter the presence of illegal aliens within
their borders, both through curtailing benefits and assuming a more active role in
direct immigration enforcement. Most of these efforts foundered under court chal-
lenge, but some did not, resulting, in at least one instance, in the imposition of more
severe consequences under state law than under federal law for similar immigra-
tion violations. See Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting, 563 U.S.
___, No. 09–115, slip op. (2011). Nevertheless, the Whiting Court found a textual
basis in federal statute for the state sanctions imposed there. Absent text-based au-
thority for separate state penalties for federal immigration violations, those state
penalties likely will fail on preemption grounds. Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S.
___, No. 11–182, slip op. (2012) (invalidating state sanctions on unauthorized aliens
seeking work in violation of federal law and striking state penalties for violations of
federal alien registration requirements). It would further appear that states must
ground their efforts to detect, arrest, and remove unauthorized aliens in authority
delegated by Congress. Id.
