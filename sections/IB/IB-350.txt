duties, but rather was a punishment for past offenses.2021 A similar

    Changes in Punishment.—Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull gave
an alternative description of the four categories of ex post facto laws,
two of which related to punishment. One such category was laws
that inflict punishment “where the party was not, by law, liable to
any punishment”; the other was laws that inflict greater punish-
ment than was authorized when the crime was committed.2023
    Illustrative of the first of these punishment categories is “a law
enacted after expiration of a previously applicable statute of limita-
tions period [as] applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecu-
tion.” Such a law, the Court ruled in Stogner v. California,2024 is
prohibited as ex post facto. Courts that had upheld extension of un-
expired statutes of limitation had been careful to distinguish situa-
tions in which the limitations periods have expired. The Court viewed
revival of criminal liability after the law had granted a person “ef-
fective amnesty” as being “unfair” in the sense addressed by the
Ex Post Facto Clause.
    Illustrative of the second punishment category are statutes, all
applicable to offenses committed prior to their enactment, that changed
an indeterminate sentence law to require a judge to impose the maxi-
mum sentence,2025 that required solitary confinement for prisoners
previously sentenced to death,2026 and that allowed a warden to fix,
within limits of one week, and keep secret the time of execu-
tion.2027 Because it made more onerous the punishment for crimes
committed before its enactment, a law that altered sentencing guide-
lines to make it more likely that the sentencing authority would
impose on a defendant a more severe sentence than was previously
likely and making it impossible for the defendant to challenge the
sentence was ex post facto as to one who had committed the offense
prior to the change.2028 The Court adopted similar reasoning as re-
gards changes in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines: even though the

frequency of parole-suitability hearings is not ex post facto as applied to prisoners
who committed offenses before enactment). The opinion modifies previous opinions
that had held some laws impermissible because they operated to the disadvantage
