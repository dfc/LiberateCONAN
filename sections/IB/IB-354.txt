and federal courts will be bound by decisions of the highest state
court on such matters, this rule does not hold when the contract is
one whose obligation is alleged to have been impaired by state law.2051
Otherwise, the challenged state authority could be vindicated through
the simple device of a modification or outright nullification by the
state court of the contract rights in issue. Similarly, the highest state
court usually has final authority in construing state statutes and
determining their validity in relation to the state constitution. But
this rule too has had to bend to some extent to the Supreme Court’s
interpretation of the Contract Clause.2052
    Suppose the following situation: (1) a municipality, acting un-
der authority conferred by a state statute, has issued bonds in aid
of a railway company; (2) the validity of this statute has been sus-
tained by the highest state court; (3) later the state legislature re-
peals certain taxes to be used to pay off the bonds when they be-
come due; (4) the repeal is sustained by a decision of the highest
state court holding that the statute authorizing the bonds was un-
constitutional ab initio. In such a case the Supreme Court would
take an appeal from the state court and would reverse the latter’s
decision of unconstitutionality because of its effect in rendering op-
erative the repeal of the tax.2053
     Suppose, however, that the state court has held the statute au-
thorizing the bonds unconstitutional ab initio in a suit by a credi-
tor for payment without the state legislature’s having repealed the
taxes. In this situation, the Supreme Court would still afford relief
if the case were one between citizens of different states, which reached
it via a lower federal court.2054 This is because in cases of this na-
