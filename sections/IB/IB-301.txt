its clause 14 powers. Thus, it held that an honorably discharged
former soldier, charged with having committed murder during mili-
tary service in Korea, could not be tried by court-martial but must
be charged in federal court, if at all.1664 After first leaning the other
way,1665 the Court on rehearing found court-martial jurisdiction lack-
ing, at least in peacetime, to try civilian dependents of service per-
sonnel for capital crimes committed outside the United States.1666
Subsequently, the Court extended its ruling to civilian dependents
overseas charged with noncapital crimes 1667 and to civilian employ-

                              WAR LEGISLATION

War Powers in Peacetime
    To some indeterminate extent, the power to wage war em-
braces the power to prepare for it and the power to deal with the
problems of adjustment following its cessation. Justice Story empha-
sized that “[i]t is important also to consider, that the surest means
of avoiding war is to be prepared for it in peace. . . . How could a
readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we
could in like manner prohibit the preparations and establishments

women for murdering their soldier husbands stationed in Japan). Chief Justice War-

under clause 14 could not reach civilians. Justices Frankfurter and Harlan con-
curred, limited to capital cases. Justices Clark and Burton dissented.
     1667 Kinsella v. United States, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) (voiding court-martial convic-

ity could see no reason for distinguishing between capital and noncapital crimes.
Justices Harlan and Frankfurter dissented on the ground that in capital cases greater
constitutional protection, available in civil courts, was required.
