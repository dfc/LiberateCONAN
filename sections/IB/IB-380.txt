gaming, cock-fighting, horse-racing or public masquerades, and that
companies should be formed for the purpose of carrying on these
practices. . . .” Would the legislature then be powerless to prohibit
them? The answer returned, of course, was no.2173
     The prevailing doctrine was stated by the U.S. Supreme Court:
“It is the settled law of this court that the interdiction of statutes
impairing the obligation of contracts does not prevent the State from
exercising such powers as are vested in it for the promotion of the
common weal, or are necessary for the general good of the public,
though contracts previously entered into between individuals may
thereby be affected. . . . In other words, that parties by entering
into contracts may not estop the legislature from enacting laws in-
tended for the public good.” 2174
    So, in an early case, we find a state recording act upheld as
applying to deeds dated before the passage of the act.2175 Later cases
have brought the police power in its more customary phases into
contact with private as well as with public contracts. Lottery tick-
ets, valid when issued, were necessarily invalidated by legislation
prohibiting the lottery business; 2176 contracts for the sale of beer,
valid when entered into, were similarly nullified by a state prohibi-
tion law; 2177 and contracts of employment were modified by later
laws regarding the liability of employers and workmen’s compensa-
tion.2178 Likewise, a contract between plaintiff and defendant did
not prevent the state from making the latter a concession that ren-
dered the contract worthless; 2179 nor did a contract as to rates be-
tween two railway companies prevent the state from imposing dif-
ferent rates; 2180 nor did a contract between a public utility company
and a customer protect the rates agreed upon from being super-
seded by those fixed by the state.2181 Similarly, a contract for the
conveyance of water beyond the limits of a state did not prevent
the state from prohibiting such conveyance.2182
