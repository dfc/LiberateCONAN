ings and procedures that were absent in the NIRA.76 The Court has
also relied on the constitutional doubt principle of statutory con-
struction to narrow interpretations of statutes that, interpreted broadly,
might have presented delegation issues.77
    Concerns in the scholarly literature with respect to the scope
of the delegation doctrine 78 have been reflected in the opinions of
some of the Justices.79 Nonetheless, the Court’s decisions continue
to approve very broad delegations,80 and the practice will likely re-
main settled. The fact that the Court has gone so long without hold-
ing a statute to be an invalid delegation, however, does not mean
that the nondelegation doctrine is a dead letter. The long list of re-

Whitman v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 474 (2001) (the NIRA “con-
ferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a
standard than stimulating the economy by assuring ‘fair competition’ ”).
     76 See, e.g., Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 424–25 (1944) (Schechter in-

volved delegation “not to a public official . . . but to private individuals”; it suffices
if Congress has sufficiently marked the field within which an administrator may act
“so it may be known whether he has kept within it in compliance with the legisla-
tive will.”).
     77 See, e.g., Industrial Union Dep’t v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607,

645–46 (1980) (plurality opinion) (invalidating an occupational safety and health regu-
lation, and observing that the statute should not be interpreted to authorize enforce-
ment of a standard that is not based on an “understandable” quantification of risk);
National Cable Television Ass’n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 342 (1974) (“hurdles
revealed in [Schechter and J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States] lead us to
read the Act narrowly to avoid constitutional problems”).
     78 E.g., A Symposium on Administrative Law: Part I—Delegation of Powers to

Administrative Agencies, 36 AMER. U. L. REV. 295 (1987); Schoenbrod, The Delegation
Doctrine: Could the Court Give It Substance?, 83 MICH. L. REV. 1223 (1985); Aranson,
Gellhorn & Robinson, A Theory of Legislative Delegation, 68 CORN. L. REV. 1 (1982).
     79 American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 543 (1981) (Chief Jus-

tice Burger dissenting); Industrial Union Dep’t v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S.
607, 671 (1980) (then-Justice Rehnquist concurring). See also United States v. Mid-
west Video Corp., 406 U.S. 649, 675, 677 (1972) (Chief Justice Burger concurring,
Justice Douglas dissenting); Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 625–26 (1963) (Jus-
tice Harlan dissenting in part). Occasionally, statutes are narrowly construed, pur-
portedly to avoid constitutional problems with delegations. E.g., Industrial Union
Dep’t , 448 U.S. at 645–46 (plurality opinion); National Cable Television Ass’n v. United
States, 415 U.S. 336, 342 (1974).
     80 E.g., Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371–79 (1989). See also Skin-

ner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 220–24 (1989); Touby v. United States,
500 U.S. 160, 164–68 (1991); Whitman v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 547
(2001). While expressing considerable reservations about the scope of delegations,
Justice Scalia, in Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 415–16, conceded both the inevitability of
delegations and the inability of the courts to police them.
     Notice Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), in which the Court
struck down the Line Item Veto Act, intended by Congress to be a delegation to the
President, finding that the authority conferred on the President was legislative power,
not executive power, which failed because the presentment clause had not and could
not have been complied with. The dissenting Justices argued that the law was prop-
erly treated as a delegation and was clearly constitutional. Id. at 453 (Justice Scalia
concurring in part and dissenting in part), 469 (Justice Breyer dissenting).
