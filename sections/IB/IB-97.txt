usually cited for the proposition that presentation of constitutional
amendment resolutions is not required.511
     The Legislative Veto.—Beginning in the 1930s, the concur-
rent resolution (as well as the simple resolution) was put to a new
use—serving as the instrument to terminate powers delegated to
the Chief Executive or to disapprove particular exercises of power
by him or his agents. The “legislative veto” or “congressional veto”
was first developed in context of the delegation to the Executive of
power to reorganize governmental agencies,512 and was really fur-
thered by the necessities of providing for national security and for-
eign affairs immediately prior to and during World War II.513 The
proliferation of “congressional veto” provisions in legislation over the
years raised a series of interrelated constitutional questions.514 Con-
gress until relatively recently had applied the veto provisions to some
action taken by the President or another executive officer—such as
a reorganization of an agency, the lowering or raising of tariff rates,
the disposal of federal property—then began expanding the device
to give itself a negative over regulations issued by executive branch
agencies, and proposals were made to give Congress a negative over
all regulations issued by executive branch independent agencies.515

     511 Although Hollingsworth did not necessarily so hold (see Tillman, supra), the

Court has reaffirmed this interpretation. See Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221, 229
(1920) (in Hollingsworth “this court settled that the submission of a constitutional
amendment did not require the action of the President”); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S.
919, 955 n.21 (1983) (in Hollingsworth the Court “held Presidential approval was
unnecessary for a proposed constitutional amendment”).
     512 Act of June 30, 1932, § 407, 47 Stat. 414.
     513 See, e.g., Lend Lease Act of March 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 31; First War Powers

Act of December 18, 1941, 55 Stat. 838; Emergency Price Control Act of January 30,
1942, 56 Stat. 23; Stabilization Act of October 2, 1942, 56 Stat. 765; War Labor Dis-
putes Act of June 25, 1943, 57 Stat. 163, all providing that the powers granted to
the President should come to an end upon adoption of concurrent resolutions to that
effect.
     514 From 1932 to 1983, by one count, nearly 300 separate provisions giving Con-

gress power to halt or overturn executive action had been passed in nearly 200 acts;
substantially more than half of these had been enacted since 1970. A partial listing
was included in The Constitution, Jefferson’s Manual and Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives, H. Doc. No. 96–398, 96th Congress, 2d Sess. (1981), 731–922. A more
up-to-date listing, in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, is contained in H. Doc.
No. 101–256, 101st Cong., 2d sess. (1991), 907–1054. Justice White’s dissent in INS
v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 968–974, 1003–1013 (1983), describes and lists many kinds
of such vetoes. The types of provisions varied widely. Many required congressional
approval before an executive action took effect, but more commonly they provided
for a negative upon executive action, by concurrent resolution of both Houses, by
resolution of only one House, or even by a committee of one House.
     515 A bill providing for this failed to receive the two-thirds vote required to pass

under suspension of the rules by only three votes in the 94th Congress. H.R. 12048,
94th Congress, 2d sess. See H. REP. NO. 94–1014, 94th Congress, 2d sess. (1976),
and 122 CONG. REC. 31615–641, 31668. Considered extensively in the 95th and 96th
Congresses, similar bills were not adopted. See Regulatory Reform and Congressio-
