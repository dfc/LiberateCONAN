determined by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to a device
previously on the market, a situation of some import to at least some
of the Justices.
    Unanimously, the Court determined that a defective design claim
was not preempted and that the MDA did not prevent states from
providing a damages remedy for violation of common-law duties that
paralleled federal requirements. But the Justices split 4–1–4 with
respect to preemption of various claims relating to manufacturing
and labeling. FDA regulations, which a majority deferred to, lim-
ited preemption to situations in which a particular state require-
ment threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. More-
over, the common-law standards were not specifically developed to
govern medical devices and their generality removed them from the
category of requirements “with respect to” specific devices. How-
ever, five Justices did agree that common-law requirements could
be, just as statutory provisions, “requirements” that were pre-
empted, though they did not agree on the application of that view.1177
    Following Cipollone, the Court observed that, although it “need
not go beyond” the statutory preemption language, it did need to
“identify the domain expressly pre-empted” by the language, so that
“our interpretation of that language does not occur in a contextual
vacuum.” That is, it must be informed by two presumptions about
the nature of preemption: the presumption that Congress does not
cavalierly preempt common-law causes of action and the principle
that Congress’s purpose is the ultimate touchstone.1178
    The Court continued to struggle with application of express pre-
emption language to state common-law tort actions in Geier v. Ameri-
can Honda Motor Co.1179 The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act contained both a preemption clause, prohibiting states
from applying “any safety standard” different from an applicable fed-
eral standard, and a “saving clause,” providing that “compliance with”
a federal safety standard “does not exempt any person from any
liability under common law.” The Court determined that the ex-
