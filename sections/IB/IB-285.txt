public law. . . . The faithful observance of this law is essential to
national character. . . .” 1560 These words of the Chancellor Kent ex-
pressed the view of the binding character of international law that
was generally accepted at the time the Constitution was adopted.
During the Revolutionary War, Congress took cognizance of all mat-
ters arising under the law of nations and professed obedience to
that law.1561 Under the Articles of Confederation, it was given ex-
clusive power to appoint courts for the trial of piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas, but no provision was made for dealing
with offenses against the law of nations.1562 The draft of the Consti-
tution submitted to the Convention of 1787 by its Committee of De-
tail empowered Congress “to declare the law and punishment of pi-
racies and felonies committed on the high seas, and the punishment
of counterfeiting the coin of the United States, and of offences against
the law of nations.” 1563 In the debate on the floor of the Conven-
tion, the discussion turned on the question as to whether the terms,
“felonies” and the “law of nations,” were sufficiently precise to be
generally understood. The view that these terms were often so vague
and indefinite as to require definition eventually prevailed and Con-
gress was authorized to define as well as punish piracies, felonies,
and offenses against the law of nations.1564

Definition of Offenses
    The fact that the Constitutional Convention considered it nec-
essary to give Congress authority to define offenses against the law
of nations does not mean that in every case Congress must under-
take to codify that law or mark its precise boundaries before pre-
scribing punishments for infractions thereof. An act punishing “the
crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations punishing the” was
held to be an appropriate exercise of the constitutional authority to
“define and punish” the offense, since it adopted by reference the
sufficiently precise definition of International Law.1565 Similarly, in
Ex parte Quirin,1566 the Court found that by the reference in the
Fifteenth Article of War to “offenders or offenses that . . . by the
law of war may be triable by such military commissions . . . ,” Con-
