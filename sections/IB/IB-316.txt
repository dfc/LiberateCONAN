both authorized the cession of territory 1769 and Congress ac-
cepted.1770 Congress divided the District into two counties, Washing-
ton and Alexandria, and provided that the local laws of the two states
should continue in effect.1771 It also established a circuit court and
provided for the appointment of judicial and law enforcement offi-
cials.1772
    There seems to have been no consideration, at least none re-
corded, given at the Convention or in the ratifying conventions to
the question of the governance of the citizens of the District.1773 Madi-
son in The Federalist did assume that the inhabitants “will have
had their voice in the election of the government which is to exer-
cise authority over them, as a municipal legislature for all local pur-
poses, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed
them. . . .” 1774 Although there was some dispute about the consti-
tutional propriety of permitting local residents a measure of “home
rule,” to use the recent term,1775 almost from the first there were
local elections provided for. In 1802, the District was divided into
five divisions, in some of which the governing officials were elected;
an elected mayor was provided in 1820. District residents elected
some of those who governed them until this form of government
was swept away in the aftermath of financial scandals in 1874 1776

    1769  Maryland Laws 1798, ch. 2, p. 46; 13 Laws of Virginia 43 (Hening 1789).
    1770  Act of July 16, 1790, 1 Stat. 130. In 1846, Congress authorized a referen-
dum in Alexandria County on the question of retroceding that portion to Virginia.
The voters approved and the area again became part of Virginia. Laws of Virginia
1845–46, ch. 64, p. 50; Act of July 9, 1846, 9 Stat. 35; Proclamation of September 7,
1846; 9 Stat. 1000. Constitutional questions were raised about the retrocession but
suit did not reach the Supreme Court until some 40 years later and the Court held
that the passage of time precluded the raising of the question. Phillips v. Payne, 92
U.S. 130 (1875).
     1771 Act of February 27, 1801, 2 Stat. 103. The declaration of the continuing

effect of state law meant that law in the District was frozen as of the date of ces-
sion, unless Congress should change it, which it seldom did. For some of the prob-
lems, see Tayloe v. Thompson, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 358 (1831); Ex parte Watkins, 32 U.S.
(7 Pet.) 568 (1833); Stelle v. Carroll, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 201 (1838); Van Ness v. United
States Bank, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 17 (1839); United States v. Eliason, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.)
291 (1842).
     1772 Act of March 3, 1801, 2 Stat. 115.
     1773 The objections raised in the ratifying conventions and elsewhere seemed to

have consisted of prediction of the perils to the Nation of setting up the National
Government in such a place. 3 J. STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
