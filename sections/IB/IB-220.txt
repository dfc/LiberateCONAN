or refer workers for employment, or businesses that have been found

    At issue in AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion 1165 was a sav-
ings provision of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) that made arbi-
tration provisions in contracts “valid, irrevocable and enforceable,
save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revoca-
tion of any contract.” 1166 An arbitration provision in their cellular
telephone contract forbade plaintiffs from seeking arbitration of an
allegedly fraudulent practice by AT&T on a class basis. The Court
closely divided over whether the FAA saving clause made this anti-
class arbitration provision attackable under California law prohib-
iting class action waivers in consumer contracts, or whether the sav-
ings clause looked solely to grounds for revoking the cellular contract
that had nothing to do with the arbitration provision.1167 Another
case focused on a preemption clause that preempted certain laws
of “a State [or] political subdivision of a State” regulating motor car-
riers, but excepted “[State] safely regulatory authority.” The Court
interpreted the exception to allow a safety regulation adopted by a
city: “[a]bsent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress’s refer-
ence to the ‘regulatory authority of a State’ should be read to pre-
serve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to del-
egate their authority to their constituent parts.” 1168
     Perhaps the broadest preemption section ever enacted, § 514 of
the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
is so constructed that the Court has been moved to comment that
the provisions “are not a model of legislative drafting.” 1169 The sec-
tion declares that the statute shall “supersede any and all State
laws insofar as they now or hereafter relate to any employee ben-
efit plan,” but saves to the States the power to enforce “any law
. . . which regulates insurance, banking, or securities,” except that
an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA shall not be “deemed”
an insurance company, an insurer, or engaged in the business of

     1167 Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia held, inter alia, that the saving clause

was not intended to open arbitration provisions themselves to possible scrutiny. 563
U.S. ___, No. 09–893, slip op. (2011). The four dissenting Justices interpreted the
saving clause as allowing use of the California law to attack the anti-class arbitra-
tion contract provision. Id. (Breyer, J. dissenting).
