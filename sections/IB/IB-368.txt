Vermont held that the legislature of that state had the right, in
furtherance of the public safety, to require chartered companies op-
erating railways to fence in their tracks and provide cattle guards.
In a matter of this nature, said the court, corporations are on a
level with individuals engaged in the same business, unless, from
their charter, they can prove the contrary.2117 Since then the rule
has been applied many times in justification of state regulation of
railroads,2118 and even of the application of a state prohibition law
to a company that had been chartered expressly to manufacture
beer.2119
    Strict Construction of Charters, Tax Exemptions.—Long be-
fore the cases last cited were decided, the principle that they illus-
trate had come to be powerfully reinforced by two others, the first
of which is that all charter privileges and immunities are to be strictly
construed as against the claims of the state, or as it is otherwise
often phrased, “nothing passes by implication in a public grant.”
     The leading case was Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge,2120
which was decided by a substantially new Court shortly after Chief
Justice Marshall’s death. The question at issue was whether the
charter of the complaining company, which authorized it to operate
a toll bridge, stood in the way of the state’s permitting another com-
pany of later date to operate a free bridge in the immediate vicin-
ity. Because the first company could point to no clause in its char-
ter specifically vesting it with an exclusive right, the Court held
    2117  Thorpe v. Rutland & Burlington R.R., 27 Vt. 140 (1854).
    2118  Thus a railroad may be required, at its own expense and irrespective of ben-
efits to itself, to eliminate grade crossings in the interest of the public safety, New
York & N.E. R.R. v. Bristol, 151 U.S. 556 (1894), to make highway crossings reason-
ably safe and convenient for public use, Great Northern Ry. v. Minnesota ex rel.
Clara City, 246 U.S. 434 (1918), to repair viaducts, Northern Pacific Railway v. Duluth,
208 U.S. 583 (1908), and to fence its right of way, Minneapolis & St. Louis Ry. v.
Emmons, 149 U.S. 364 (1893). Though a railroad company owns the right of way
along a street, the city may require it to lay tracks to conform to the established
grade; to fill in tracks at street intersections; and to remove tracks from a busy street
intersection, when the attendant disadvantage and expense are small and the safety
of the public appreciably enhanced Denver & R.G. R.R. v. Denver, 250 U.S. 241 (1919).
     Likewise the state, in the public interest, may require a railroad to reestablish
an abandoned station, even though the railroad commission had previously autho-
rized its abandonment on condition that another station be established elsewhere, a
condition which had been complied with. Railroad Co. v. Hamersley, 104 U.S. 1 (1881).
It may impose upon a railroad liability for fire communicated by its locomotives,
even though the state had previously authorized the company to use said type of
locomotive power, St. Louis & S.F. Ry. v. Mathews, 165 U.S. 1, 5 (1897), and it may
penalize the failure to cut drains through embankments so as to prevent flooding of
adjacent lands. Chicago & Alton R.R. v. Tranbarger, 238 U.S. 67 (1915).
     2119 Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25 (1878). See also Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde

Park, 97 U.S. 659 (1878); Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 345
(1909).
