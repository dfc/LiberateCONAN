          tutional problem, the Court in another case held that Congress had
          not evidenced clear intent to eliminate federal court habeas corpus
          jurisdiction to determine whether the Attorney General retained dis-
          cretionary authority to waive deportation for a limited category of
          resident aliens who had entered guilty pleas before IIRIRA re-
          pealed the waiver authority.1881 “[At] the absolute minimum,” the
          Court wrote, “the Suspension Clause protects the writ as it existed
          in 1789. At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served
          as a means of reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it
          is in that context that its protections have been strongest.” 1882

passed.

                                      BILLS OF ATTAINDER
              “Bills of attainder . . . are such special acts of the legislature,
          as inflict capital punishments upon persons supposed to be guilty
          of high offences, such as treason and felony, without any conviction
          in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. If an act inflicts a
          milder degree of punishment than death, it is called a bill of pains
          and penalties. . . . In such cases, the legislature assumes judicial
          magistracy, pronouncing upon the guilt of the party without any of
          the common forms and guards of trial, and satisfying itself with
          proofs, when such proofs are within its reach, whether they are con-
          formable to the rules of evidence, or not. In short, in all such cases,
          the legislature exercises the highest power of sovereignty, and what
          may be properly deemed an irresponsible despotic discretion, being
          governed solely by what it deems political necessity or expediency,
          and too often under the influence of unreasonable fears, or un-
          founded suspicions.” 1883 The phrase “bill of attainder,” as used in
          this clause and in clause 1 of § 10, applies to bills of pains and pen-
          alties as well as to the traditional bills of attainder.1884
              The prohibition embodied in this clause is not to be narrowly
          construed in the context of traditional forms but is to be inter-
          preted in accordance with the designs of the framers so as to pre-
          clude trial by legislature, which would violate the separation of pow-
