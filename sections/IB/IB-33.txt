and criminal procedure and of evidence it directed that such rules
supersede previously enacted statutes with which they conflict.143

Delegations to the President in Areas of Shared Authority
    It was asserted in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corpora-
tion 144 that the delegation of discretion in dealing with foreign re-
lations stands upon a different footing than the transfer of author-
ity to regulate domestic concerns. There the Court upheld a joint
resolution of Congress making it unlawful to sell arms to certain
warring countries upon certain findings by the President, a typi-
cally contingent type of delegation. But Justice Sutherland for the
Court proclaimed that the President is largely free of the constitu-
tional constraints imposed by the nondelegation doctrine when he
acts in foreign affairs.145 Whether or not the President is the “sole
organ of the nation” in its foreign relations, as asserted in Curtiss-
Wright,146 a lesser standard of delegation is applied in foreign af-
fairs and other areas of power shared by the President and Con-
gress.
     Sixty years later, the Court, relying on Curtiss-Wright, rein-
forced such a distinction in a case involving the President’s author-
ity over military justice.147 The Court in Loving v. United States 148
approved a virtually standardless delegation to the President. Ar-
ticle 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) 149 pro-
vides for the death penalty for premeditated murder and felony mur-
der, but the statute does not comport with the Court’s capital
punishment jurisprudence. Generally, application of the death sen-
tence must be cabined by standards that require the sentencing au-
thority to narrow the class of convicted persons to be so sentenced

     143 See 28 U.S.C. § 2072. In Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233, 241 (1973),

the Court referred in passing to the supersession of statutes without evincing any
doubts about the validity of the results. When Congress amended the Rules En-
abling Acts in the 100th Congress, Pub. L. 100–702, 102 Stat. 4642, 4648, amend-
ing 28 U.S.C. § 2072, the House would have altered supersession, but the Senate
disagreed, the House acquiesced, and the old provision remained. See H.R. 4807, H.
REP. NO. 100–889, 100th Cong., 2d sess. (1988), 27–29; 134 CONG REC. 23573–84 (1988),
id. at 31051–52 (Sen. Heflin); id. at 31872 (Rep. Kastenmeier).
     144 299 U.S. 304, 319–29 (1936).
     145 299 U.S. at 319–22. For a particularly strong, recent assertion of the point,

see Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 291–92 (1981). This view also informs the Court’s
analysis in Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981). See also United States v.
Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S. 1 (1926) (Trading With Enemy Act delegation to dis-
pose of seized enemy property).
