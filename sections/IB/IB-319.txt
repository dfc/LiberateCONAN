             AUTHORITY OVER PLACES PURCHASED

“Places”
    This clause has been broadly construed to cover all structures
necessary for carrying on the business of the National Govern-
ment.1797 It includes post offices,1798 a hospital and a hotel located
in a national park,1799 and locks and dams for the improvement of
navigation.1800 But it does not cover lands acquired for forests, parks,
ranges, wild life sanctuaries or flood control.1801 Nevertheless, the
Supreme Court has held that a state may convey, and the Con-
gress may accept, either exclusive or qualified jurisdiction over prop-
erty acquired within the geographical limits of a state, for pur-
poses other than those enumerated in clause 17.1802
    After exclusive jurisdiction over lands within a state has been
ceded to the United States, Congress alone has the power to pun-
ish crimes committed within the ceded territory.1803 Private prop-
erty located thereon is not subject to taxation by the state,1804 nor
can state statutes enacted subsequent to the transfer have any op-
eration therein.1805 But the local laws in force at the date of ces-
sion that are protective of private rights continue in force until ab-
rogated by Congress.1806 Moreover, as long as there is no interference
