        or charge in handling . . . any necessaries” 1755 as repugnant to the
        Fifth and Sixth Amendments in that it was so vague and indefinite
        that it denied due process and failed to give adequate notice of what
        acts would violate it.1756

                                  THE MILITIA CLAUSES

        Calling Out the Militia
             The states as well as Congress may prescribe penalties for fail-
        ure to obey the President’s call of the militia. They also have a con-
        current power to aid the National Government by calls under their
        own authority, and in emergencies may use the militia to put down
        armed insurrection.1757 The Federal Government may call out the
        militia in case of civil war; its authority to suppress rebellion is
        found in the power to suppress insurrection and to carry on war.1758
        The act of February 28, 1795,1759 which delegated to the President
        the power to call out the militia, was held constitutional.1760 A mi-
        litiaman who refused to obey such a call was not “employed in the
        service of the United States so as to be subject to the article of war,”
        but was liable to be tried for disobedience of the act of 1795.1761
