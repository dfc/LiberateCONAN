Court held, by a vote of five-to-four, that a tax on income from prop-
erty was a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution and
hence void because not apportioned according to the census.

Restriction of the Pollock Decision
    The Pollock decision encouraged taxpayers to challenge the right
of Congress to levy by the rule of uniformity numerous taxes that
had always been reckoned to be excises. But the Court evinced a
strong reluctance to extend the doctrine to such exactions. Purport-
ing to distinguish taxes levied “because of ownership” or “upon prop-
erty as such” from those laid upon “privileges,” 1936 it sustained as
“excises” a tax on sales on business exchanges,1937 a succession tax
which was construed to fall on the recipients of the property trans-
mitted rather than on the estate of the decedent,1938 and a tax on
manufactured tobacco in the hands of a dealer, after an excise tax
had been paid by the manufacturer.1939 Again, in Thomas v. United
States,1940 the validity of a stamp tax on sales of stock certificates
was sustained on the basis of a definition of “duties, imposts and
excises.” These terms, according to the Chief Justice, “were used
comprehensively to cover customs and excise duties imposed on im-
portation, consumption, manufacture and sale of certain commodi-
ties, privileges, particular business transactions, vocations, occupa-
tions and the like.” 1941 On the same day, in Spreckels Sugar Refining
Co. v. McClain,1942 it ruled that an exaction, denominated a special
excise tax, that was imposed on the business of refining sugar and
measured by the gross receipts thereof, was in truth an excise and
hence properly levied by the rule of uniformity. The lesson of Flint
v. Stone Tracy Co.1943 was the same. In Flint, what was in form an
income tax was sustained as a tax on the privilege of doing busi-
ness as a corporation, the value of the privilege being measured by
the income, including income from investments. Similarly, in Stanton
v. Baltic Mining Co.,1944 a tax on the annual production of mines
was held to be “independently of the effect of the operation of the
Sixteenth Amendment . . . not a tax upon property as such be-
