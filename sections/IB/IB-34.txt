and justify the individual imposition of the sentence.150 In 1984, the
President promulgated standards that purported to supply the con-
stitutional validity the UCMJ needed.151
     The Court in Loving held that Congress could delegate to the
President the authority to prescribe standards for the imposition of
the death penalty under military law—Congress’s power under Ar-
ticle I, § 8, cl. 14, is not exclusive—and that Congress had done so
in the UCMJ by providing that the punishment imposed by a court-
martial may not exceed “such limits as the President may pre-
scribe.” 152 Acknowledging that a delegation must contain some “in-
telligible principle” to guide the recipient of the delegation, the Court
nonetheless held this not to be true when the delegation was made
to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief. “The same limi-
tations on delegation do not apply” if the entity authorized to exer-
cise delegated authority itself possesses independent authority over
the subject matter. The President’s responsibilities as Commander-
in-Chief require him to superintend the military, including the courts-
martial, and thus the delegated duty is interlinked with duties al-
ready assigned the President by the Constitution.153

Delegations to States and to Private Entities
     Beginning in the Nation’s early years, Congress has enacted hun-
dreds of statutes that contained provisions authorizing state offi-
cers to enforce and execute federal laws.154 Challenges to the prac-
tice have been uniformly rejected. Although the Court early expressed
its doubt that Congress could compel state officers to act, it enter-
tained no such thoughts about the propriety of authorizing them to
act if they chose.155 When, in the Selective Draft Law Cases,156 the
contention was made that the 1917 statute authorizing a military
draft was invalid because of its delegations of duties to state offi-
      150 The Court assumed the applicability of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972),

and its progeny, to the military, 517 U.S. at 755–56, a point on which Justice Thomas
disagreed, id. at 777.
