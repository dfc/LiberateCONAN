     That the power of Congress to punish seditious utterances in
wartime is limited by the First Amendment was assumed by the
Court in a series of cases,1723 in which it nonetheless affirmed con-
viction for violations of the Espionage Act of 1917.1724 The Court
also upheld a state law making it an offense for persons to advo-
cate that citizens of the state should refuse to assist in prosecuting
war against enemies of the United States.1725 Justice Holmes matter-
of-factly stated the essence of the pattern that we have mentioned:
“When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time
of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will
not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could re-
gard them as protected by any constitutional right.” 1726
    By far, the most dramatic restraint of personal liberty imposed
during World War II was the detention and relocation of the Japa-
nese residents of the Western states, including those who were native-
born citizens of the United States. When various phases of this pro-
gram were challenged, the Court held that, in order to prevent
espionage and sabotage, the authorities could restrict the move-
ment of these persons by a curfew order 1727 and even exclude them
from defined areas by regulation,1728 but that a citizen of Japanese
ancestry whose loyalty was conceded could not continue to be de-
tained in a relocation camp.1729
     A mixed pattern emerges from an examination of the Cold War
period. Legislation designed to regulate and punish the organiza-
tional activities of the Communist Party and its adherents was at
first upheld,1730 and then in a series of cases was practically viti-

nated. Now that the public safety is assured, this question, as well as all others,
can be discussed and decided without passion or the admixture of any element not
required to form a legal judgment.” 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) at 109 (emphasis by Court).

     1728 Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944). The five-Justice majority

opinion in Korematsuwas careful to state that it was ruling on exclusion only, and
not on compelled reporting to and remaining in an assembly center or relocation
camp, which were the highly likely consequences of obeying the exclusion order un-
der the regulation. 323 U.S. at 222–23.
     1729 Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944). The Endo Court expressly avoided a

direct constitutional ruling, holding instead that continued detention could not be
supported by the statute and executive orders that underlay the detention program.
