           Although requiring the election of Representatives by districts,
       Congress has left it to the states to draw district boundaries. This
       has occasioned a number of disputes. In Ohio ex rel. Davis v.
       Hildebrant,358 a requirement that a redistricting law be submitted
       to a popular referendum was challenged and sustained. After the
       reapportionment made pursuant to the 1930 census, deadlocks be-
       tween the Governor and legislature in several states produced a se-
       ries of cases in which the right of the Governor to veto a reappor-
       tionment bill was questioned. Contrasting this function with other
       duties committed to state legislatures by the Constitution, the Court
       decided that it was legislative in character and subject to guberna-
       torial veto to the same extent as ordinary legislation under the terms
       of the state constitution.359

    Clause 4. When vacancies happen in the Representation from
any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of
Election to fill such Vacancies.
                                         IN GENERAL
           The Supreme Court has not interpreted this clause.

    Clause 5. The House of Representatives shall chuse their
Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Im-
peachment.

    SECTION 3. Clause 1. [The Senate of the United States shall
be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the leg-
islature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one
vote].360
