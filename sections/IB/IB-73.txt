registration of voters and election talley sheets.370 When the Demo-
cratic Party regained control of Congress, these pieces of Reconstruc-
tion legislation dealing specifically with elections were repealed,371
but other statutes prohibiting interference with civil rights gener-
ally were retained and these were used in later years. More re-
cently, Congress has enacted, in 1957, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1970,
1975, 1980, and 1982, legislation to protect the right to vote in all
elections, federal, state, and local, through the assignment of fed-
eral registrars and poll watchers, suspension of literacy and other
tests, and the broad proscription of intimidation and reprisal, whether
with or without state action.372
     Another chapter was begun in 1907 when Congress passed the
Tillman Act, prohibiting national banks and corporations from mak-
ing contributions in federal elections.373 The Corrupt Practices Act,
first enacted in 1910 and replaced by another law in 1925, ex-
tended federal regulation of campaign contributions and expendi-
tures in federal elections,374 and other acts have similarly provided
other regulations.375
    As noted above, although § 2, cl. 1, of this Article vests in the
states the responsibility, now limited, to establish voter qualifica-
tions for congressional elections, the Court has held that the right
to vote for Members of Congress is derived from the Federal Con-
stitution,376 and that Congress therefore may legislate under this
section of the Article to protect the integrity of this right. Congress
may protect the right of suffrage against both official and private
     370 The constitutionality of sections pertaining to federal elections was sus-

tained in Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880), and Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S.
651 (1884). The legislation pertaining to all elections was struck down as going be-
yond Congress’s power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment. United States v. Reese,
