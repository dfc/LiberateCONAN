and thereby to trigger imposition of criminal penalties, set by stat-
ute, that vary according to the level of a drug’s classification by the
Attorney General.182
    Congress may also confer on administrators authority to pre-
scribe criteria for ascertaining an appropriate sentence within the
range between the maximum and minimum penalties that are set
by statute. The Court upheld Congress’s conferral of “significant dis-
cretion” on the Sentencing Commission to set binding sentencing
guidelines establishing a range of determinate sentences for all cat-
egories of federal offenses and defendants.183 Although the Commis-
sion was given significant discretionary authority “to determine the
relative severity of federal crimes, . . . assess the relative weight of
the offender characteristics listed by Congress, . . . to determine which
crimes have been punished too leniently and which too severely, [and]
which types of criminals are to be considered similar,” Congress also
gave the Commission extensive guidance in the Act, and did not
confer authority to create new crimes or to enact a federal death
penalty for any offense.184
     Delegation and Individual Liberties.—Some Justices have
argued that delegations by Congress of power to affect the exercise
of “fundamental freedoms” by citizens must be closely scrutinized
to require the exercise of a congressional judgment about meaning-
ful standards.185 The only pronouncement in a majority opinion, how-
ever, is that, even with regard to the regulation of liberty, the stan-
dards of the delegation “must be adequate to pass scrutiny by the
accepted tests.” 186 The standard practice of the Court has been to
interpret the delegation narrowly so as to avoid constitutional prob-
lems.187
     Perhaps refining the delegation doctrine, at least in cases where
Fifth Amendment due process interests are implicated, the Court
    182  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160 (1991).
    183  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989).
     184 488 U.S. at 377–78. “As for every other offense within the Commission’s ju-

risdiction, the Commission could include the death penalty within the guidelines only
if that punishment was authorized in the first instance by Congress and only if such
inclusion comported with the substantial guidance Congress gave the Commission
in fulfilling its assignments.” Id. at 378 n.11.
     185 United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 269 (1967) (Justice Brennan concur-

ring). The view was specifically rejected by Justices White and Harlan in dissent,
id. at 288–89, and ignored by the majority.
     186 Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 129 (1958).
     187 Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958); Schneider v. Smith, 390 U.S. 17 (1968);

Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 506–08 (1959) (Court will not follow traditional
principles of congressional acquiescence in administrative interpretation to infer a
delegation of authority to impose an industrial security clearance program that lacks
the safeguards of due process). More recently, the Court has eschewed even this lim-
ited mode of construction. Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981).
