be produced at the site, “constitute national defense assets,” and
the project was justifiable under the war powers.1672
    Perhaps the most significant example of legislation adopted pur-
suant to the war powers when no actual “shooting war” was in prog-
ress was the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, establishing a body to over-
see and further the research into and development of atomic energy
for both military and civil purposes.1673 Congress has also autho-
rized a vast amount of highway construction, pursuant to its con-
ception of their “primary importance to the national defense,” 1674
and the first extensive program of federal financial assistance in
the field of education was the National Defense Education Act.1675
These measures, of course, might also be upheld under the power
to spend for the “common defense.” 1676 The post-World War II years,
though nominally peacetime, constituted the era of the Cold War
and the occasions for several armed conflicts, notably in Korea and
Indochina, in which the Congress enacted much legislation de-
signed to strengthen national security, including an apparently per-
manent draft,1677 authorization of extensive space exploration,1678
authorization for wage and price controls,1679 and continued exten-
sion of the Renegotiation Act to recapture excess profits on defense
contracts.1680 Additionally, the period saw extensive regulation of mat-
ter affecting individual rights, such as loyalty-security pro-
grams,1681 passport controls,1682 and limitations on members of the
Communist Party and associated organizations,1683 all of which are
dealt with in other sections.
