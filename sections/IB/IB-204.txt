Apple Advertising Comm’n,1091 the Court confronted a North Caro-
lina requirement that closed containers of apples offered for sale or
shipped into North Carolina carry no grade other than the appli-
cable U.S. grade. Washington State mandated that all apples pro-
duced in and shipped in interstate commerce pass a much more rig-
orous inspection than that mandated by the United States. The
inability to display the recognized state grade in North Carolina
impeded marketing of Washington apples. The Court obviously sus-
pected that the impact was intended, but, rather than strike down
the state requirement as purposeful, it held that the regulation had
the practical effect of discriminating, and, as no defense based on
possible consumer protection could be presented, the Court invali-
dated the state law.1092 State actions to promote local products and
producers, of everything from milk 1093 to alcohol,1094 may not be
achieved through protectionism.
     Even garbage transportation and disposition is covered by the
negative commerce clause. A New Jersey statute that banned the
importation of most solid or liquid wastes that originated outside
the state was struck down as “an obvious effort to saddle those out-
side the State with the entire burden of slowing the flow of refuse
into New Jersey’s remaining landfill sites”; the state could not jus-
tify the statute as a quarantine law designed to protect the public

mote and enhance local products and businesses include Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U.S. 137 (1970) (state required producer of high-quality cantaloupes to pack them
in the state, rather than in an adjacent state at considerably less expense, in order
that the produce be identified with the producing state); Foster-Fountain Packing
Co. v. Haydel, 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (state banned export of shrimp from state until
hulls and heads were removed and processed, in order to favor canning and manu-
facture within the state).
     1092 That discriminatory effects will result in invalidation, as well as purposeful

discrimination, is also drawn from Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 340 U.S. 349
(1951).
     1093 E.g., H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525 (1949). See also

Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366 (1976) (state effort to com-
bat discrimination by other states against its milk through reciprocity provisions).
In West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186 (1994), the Court held invalidly
discriminatory against interstate commerce a state milk pricing order, which im-
posed an assessment on all milk sold by dealers to in-state retailers, the entire as-
sessment being distributed to in-state dairy farmers despite the fact that about two-
thirds of the assessed milk was produced out of state. The avowed purpose and
undisputed effect of the provision was to enable higher-cost in-state dairy farmers
to compete with lower-cost dairy farmers in other states.

Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573 (1986). See also Bacchus Im-
ports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263 (1984) (a tax case). But cf. Pharmaceutical Re-
search and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644 (2003) (state prescription drug
program providing rebates to participating companies does not regulate prices of out-
of-state transactions and does not favor in-state over out-of-state companies).
