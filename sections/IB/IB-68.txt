    Although the Census Clause expressly provides for an enumera-
tion of persons, Congress has expanded the scope of the census by
including not only the free persons in the states, but also those in
the territories, and by requiring all persons over eighteen years of
age to answer an ever-lengthening list of inquiries concerning their
personal and economic affairs. This extended scope of the census
has received the implied approval of the Supreme Court,353 and is
one of the methods whereby the national legislature exercises its
inherent power to obtain the information necessary for intelligent
legislative action.
     Although taking an enlarged view of its census power, Con-
gress has not always complied with its positive mandate to reappor-
tion representatives among the states after the census is taken.354
It failed to make such a reapportionment after the census of 1920,
being unable to reach agreement for allotting representation with-
out further increasing the size of the House. Ultimately, by the act
of June 18, 1929,355 it provided that the membership of the House
of Representatives should henceforth be restricted to 435 members,
to be distributed among the States by the so-called “method of ma-
jor fractions,” which had been earlier employed in the apportion-
ment of 1911, and which has now been replaced with the “method
of equal proportions.” Following the 1990 census, a state that had
lost a House seat as a result of the use of this formula sued, alleg-
ing a violation of the “one person, one vote” rule derived from Ar-
ticle I, § 2. Exhibiting considerable deference to Congress and a stated
appreciation of the difficulties in achieving interstate equalities, the
Supreme Court upheld the formula and the resultant apportion-
ment.356 The goal of absolute population equality among districts
“is realistic and appropriate” within a single state, but the constitu-
tional guarantee of one Representative for each state constrains ap-


tion and statute; and Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992), upholding the
practice of the Secretary of Commerce in allocating overseas federal employees and
military personnel to the states of last residence. The mandate of an enumeration
of “their respective numbers” was complied with, it having been the practice since
the first enumeration to allocate persons to the place of their “usual residence,” and
to construe both this term and the word “inhabitant” broadly to include people tem-
porarily absent.
