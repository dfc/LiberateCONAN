traffic, was amended in 1903 so as to embrace much of the intra-
state rail systems on which there was any connection with inter-
state commerce.760 The Court sustained this extension in language
much like that it would use in the Shreveport case three years later.761
These laws were followed by the Hours of Service Act of 1907,762
which prescribed maximum hours of employment for rail workers
in interstate or foreign commerce. The Court sustained the regula-
tion as a reasonable means of protecting workers and the public
from the hazards which could develop from long, tiring hours of la-
bor.763
    Most far-reaching of these regulatory measures were the Fed-
eral Employers Liability Acts of 1906 764 and 1908.765 These laws
were intended to modify the common-law rules with regard to the
liability of employers for injuries suffered by their employees in the
course of their employment and under which employers were gen-
erally not liable. Rejecting the argument that regulation of such re-
lationships between employers and employees was a reserved state
power, the Court adopted the argument of the United States that
Congress was empowered to do anything it might deem appropri-
ate to save interstate commerce from interruption or burdening. In-
asmuch as the labor of employees was necessary for the function of
commerce, Congress could certainly act to ameliorate conditions that
made labor less efficient, less economical, and less reliable. Assur-
ance of compensation for injuries growing out of negligence in the
course of employment was such a permissible regulation.766
    Legislation and litigation dealing with the organizational rights
of rail employees are dealt with elsewhere.767
    Regulation of Other Agents of Carriage and Communica-
tions.—In 1914, the Court affirmed the power of Congress to regu-
late the transportation of oil and gas in pipelines from one State to

     766 The Second Employers’ Liability Cases, 223 U.S. 1 (1912). For a longer pe-

riod, a Court majority reviewed a surprising large number of FELA cases, almost
uniformly expanding the scope of recovery under the statute. Cf. Rogers v. Missouri
Pacific R.R., 352 U.S. 500 (1957). This practice was criticized both within and with-
out the Court, cf. Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 352 U.S. 521, 524 (1957)
