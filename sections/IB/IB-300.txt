application of the Articles to conduct essentially composed of speech
necessitate a voiding of the conviction, as the speech was unpro-
tected, and, even though it might reach protected speech, the offi-
cer here was unable to raise that issue.1655
    Military courts are not Article III courts, but are agencies estab-
lished pursuant to Article I.1656 In the 19th century, the Court es-
tablished that the civil courts have no power to interfere with courts-
martial and that court-martial decisions are not subject to civil court
review.1657 Until August 1, 1984, the Supreme Court had no juris-
diction to review by writ of certiorari the proceedings of a military
commission, but as of that date Congress conferred appellate juris-
diction of decisions of the Court of Military Appeals.1658 Prior to that
time, civil court review of court-martial decisions was possible through
habeas corpus jurisdiction,1659 an avenue that continues to exist, but
the Court severely limited the scope of such review, restricting it to
the issue whether the court-martial has jurisdiction over the per-
son tried and the offense charged.1660 In Burns v. Wilson,1661 how-
ever, at least seven Justices appeared to reject the traditional view
and adopt the position that civil courts on habeas corpus could re-
view claims of denials of due process rights to which the military
had not given full and fair consideration. Since Burns, the Court
has thrown little light on the range of issues cognizable by a fed-
eral court in such litigation 1662 and the lower federal courts have
divided several possible ways.1663

rity of tenure and of compensation.

diction to intervene in military court proceedings prior to judgment, as a matter of
equity, following the standards applicable to federal court intervention in state crimi-
nal proceedings, they should act when the petitioner has not exhausted his military
remedies only in extraordinary circumstances. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S.
