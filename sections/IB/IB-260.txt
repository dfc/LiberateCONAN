and cruel and unusual punishment,1382 a right to bail,1383 a right
to procedural due process,1384 a right to counsel,1385 a right to no-
tice of charges and hearing,1386 and a right to cross-examine.1387
    Notwithstanding these guarantees, the Supreme Court has up-
held a number of statutory deportation measures as not unconstitu-
tional. The Internal Security Act of 1950, in authorizing the Attor-
ney General to hold in custody, without bail, aliens who are members
of the Communist Party of the United States, pending determina-
tion as to their deportability, is not unconstitutional.1388 Nor was it
unconstitutional to deport under the Alien Registration Act of 1940 1389
a legally resident alien because of membership in the Communist
Party, although such membership ended before the enactment of the
Act. Such application of the Act did not make it ex post facto, being
but an exercise of the power of the United States to terminate its
hospitality ad libitum.1390 And a statutory provision 1391 making it
a felony for an alien against whom a specified order of deportation
is outstanding “to willfully fail or refuse to make timely application
for travel or other documents necessary to his departure” was not
on its face void for “vagueness.” 1392 An alien unlawfully in the coun-
try “has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a
defense against his deportation.” 1393

Persons Who May Be Released From Debt
    In an early case on circuit, Justice Livingston suggested that
inasmuch as the English statutes on the subject of bankruptcy from
the time of Henry VIII down had applied only to traders it might
“well be doubted, whether an act of Congress subjecting to such a
law every description of persons within the United States, would

juveniles apprehended on suspicion of being deportable, unless parents, close rela-
tives, or legal guardians were available to accept release, as against a substantive
due process attack.
