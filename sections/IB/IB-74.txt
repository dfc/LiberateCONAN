abridgment.377 Where a primary election is an integral part of the
procedure of choice, the right to vote in that primary election is sub-
ject to congressional protection.378 The right embraces, of course,
the opportunity to cast a ballot and to have it counted honestly.379
Freedom from personal violence and intimidation may be se-
cured.380 The integrity of the process may be safeguarded against a
failure to count ballots lawfully cast 381 or the dilution of their value
by the stuffing of the ballot box with fraudulent ballots.382 But the
bribery of voters, although within reach of congressional power un-
der other clauses of the Constitution, has been held not to be an
interference with the rights guaranteed by this section to other quali-
fied voters.383
     To accomplish the ends under this clause, Congress may adopt
the statutes of the states and enforce them by its own sanctions.384
It may punish a state election officer for violating his duty under a
state law governing congressional elections.385 It may, in short, use
its power under this clause, combined with the Necessary and Proper
Clause, to regulate the times, places, and manner of electing Mem-
bers of Congress so as to fully safeguard the integrity of the pro-
cess; it may not, however, under this clause, provide different quali-
fications for electors than those provided by the states.386
    State authority to regulate the “times, places, and manner” of
holding congressional elections has also been tested, and has been
described by the Court as “embrac[ing] authority to provide a com-
plete code for congressional elections . . . ; in short, to enact the
numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which ex-
perience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental

     386 In Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970), however, Justice Black grounded

his vote to uphold the age reduction in federal elections and the presidential voting
residency provision sections of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 on this
clause. Id. at 119–35. Four Justices specifically rejected this construction, id. at 209–
12, 288–92, and the other four implicitly rejected it by relying on totally different
sections of the Constitution in coming to the same conclusions as did Justice Black.
