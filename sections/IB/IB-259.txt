all times and to be exhibited to any police officer upon demand and
to other licensing officers upon applications for such things as driv-
ers’ licenses.1375
     Another decision voided a Pennsylvania law limiting those eli-
gible to welfare assistance to citizens and an Arizona law prescrib-
ing a fifteen-year durational residency period before an alien could
be eligible for welfare assistance.1376 Congress had provided, Jus-
tice Blackmun wrote for a unanimous Court, that persons who were
likely to become public charges could not be admitted to the United
States and that any alien who became a public charge within five
years of his admission was to be deported unless he could show that
the causes of his economic situation arose after his entry.1377 Thus,
in effect Congress had declared that lawfully admitted resident aliens
who became public charges for causes arising after their entry were
entitled to the full and equal benefit of all laws for the security of
persons and property and the states were disabled from denying
aliens these benefits.1378

Deportation
    Unlike the exclusion proceedings,1379 deportation proceedings af-
ford the alien a number of constitutional rights: a right against self-
incrimination,1380 protection against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures,1381 guarantees against ex post facto laws, bills of attainder,

     1375 312 U.S. at 68. The Court did not squarely hold the state incapable of hav-

ing such a law in the absence of federal law but appeared to lean in that direction.
State sanctions for violating federal alien registration laws were overturned in Ari-
zona v. United States, at least in part because the state penalties were greater than
those under federal law for the same violation. But see De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S.
351 (1976), in which the Court, ten years prior to enactment of federal employer
sanctions, upheld a state law prohibiting an employer from hiring aliens not en-
titled to lawful residence in the United States. The Court wrote that states may
enact legislation touching upon aliens coexistent with federal laws, under regular
preemption standards, unless the nature of the regulated subject matter precludes
the conclusion or unless Congress has unmistakably ordained the impermissibility
of state law. For examples of state sanctions against unauthorized aliens that have
been struck on preemption grounds, see Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. ___, No.
