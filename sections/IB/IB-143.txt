    Sherman Act Revived.—Four years later came Addyston Pipe
and Steel Co. v. United States,781 in which the Antitrust Act was
successfully applied to an industrial combination for the first time.
The agreements in the case, the parties to which were manufactur-
ing concerns, effected a division of territory among them, and so
involved, it was held, a “direct” restraint on the distribution and
hence of the transportation of the products of the contracting firms.
The holding, however, did not question the doctrine of the earlier
case, which in fact continued substantially undisturbed until 1905,
when Swift & Co. v. United States 782 was decided.
    The “Current of Commerce” Concept: The Swift Case.—
Defendants in Swift were some thirty firms engaged in Chicago and
other cities in the business of buying livestock in their stockyards,
in converting it at their packing houses into fresh meat, and in the
sale and shipment of such fresh meat to purchasers in other states.
The charge against them was that they had entered into a combi-
nation to refrain from bidding against each other in the local mar-
kets, to fix the prices at which they would sell, to restrict ship-
ments of meat, and to do other forbidden acts. The case was appealed
to the Supreme Court on defendants’ contention that certain of the
acts complained of were not acts of interstate commerce and so did
not fall within a valid reading of the Sherman Act. The Court, how-
ever, sustained the government on the ground that the “scheme as

nation, therefore, that disturbs or unreasonably obstructs freedom in buying and
selling articles manufactured to be sold to persons in other States or to be carried
to other States—a freedom that cannot exist if the right to buy and sell is fettered
by unlawful restraints that crush out competition—affects, not incidentally, but di-
rectly, the people of all the States; and the remedy for such an evil is found only in
the exercise of powers confided to a government which, this court has said, was the
government of all, exercising powers delegated by all, representing all, acting for
all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405.” 156 U.S. at 33.
     781 175 U.S. 211 (1899).
     782 196 U.S. 375 (1905). The Sherman Act was applied to break up combina-

tions of interstate carriers in United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass’n, 166 U.S.
290 (1897); United States v. Joint-Traffic Ass’n, 171 U.S. 505 (1898); and Northern
Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197 (1904).
     In Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 229–39
(1948), Justice Rutledge, for the Court, critically reviewed the jurisprudence of the
limitations on the Act and the deconstruction of the judicial constraints. In recent
years, the Court’s decisions have permitted the reach of the Sherman Act to expand
along with the expanding notions of congressional power. Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Pav-
ing Co., 419 U.S. 186 (1974); Hospital Building Co. v. Rex Hospital Trustees, 425
U.S. 738 (1976); McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232 (1980);
Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322 (1991). The Court, however, does in-
sist that plaintiffs alleging that an intrastate activity violates the Act prove the re-
lationship to interstate commerce set forth in the Act. Gulf Oil Corp, 419 U.S. at
194–99.
