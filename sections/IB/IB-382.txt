     Evaluation of the Clause Today.—It should not be inferred
that the Contract Clause is today totally moribund. Even prior to
the most recent decisions, it still furnished the basis for some de-
gree of judicial review as to the substantiality of the factual justifi-
cation of a professed exercise by a state legislature of its police power,
and in the case of legislation affecting the remedial rights of credi-
tors, it still affords a solid and palpable barrier against legislative
erosion. Nor is this surprising in view of the fact that, as we have
seen, such rights were foremost in the minds of the framers of the
clause. The Court’s attitude toward insolvency laws, redemption laws,
exemption laws, appraisement laws and the like, has always been
that they may not be given retroactive operation,2187 and the gen-
eral lesson of these earlier cases is confirmed by the Court’s deci-
sions between 1934 and 1945 in certain cases involving state mora-
torium statutes. In Home Building & Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell,2188
the leading case, a closely divided Court sustained the Minnesota
Moratorium Act of April 18, 1933, which, reciting the existence of a
severe financial and economic depression for several years and the
frequent occurrence of mortgage foreclosure sales for inadequate prices,
and asserting that these conditions had created an economic emer-
gency calling for the exercise of the State’s police power, authorized
its courts to extend the period for redemption from foreclosure sales
for such additional time as they might deem just and equitable, al-
though in no event beyond May 1, 1935.
    The act also left the mortgagor in possession during the period
of extension, subject to the requirement that he pay a reasonable
rental for the property as fixed by the court. Contemporaneously,
however, less carefully drawn statutes from Missouri and Arkan-
sas, acts that were not as considerate of creditor’s rights, were set
aside as violating the Contract Clause.2189 “A State is free to regu-
late the procedure in its courts even with reference to contracts al-

in which was sustained a New Jersey statute amending in view of the Depression
the law governing building and loan associations. The authority of the state to safe-
guard the vital interests of the people, said Justice Reed, “extends to economic needs
as well.” Id. at 39. In Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal
Co., 335 U.S. 525, 531–32 (1949), the Court dismissed out-of-hand a suggestion that
a state law outlawing union security agreements was an invalid impairment of ex-
isting contracts, citing Blaisdell and Veix.
