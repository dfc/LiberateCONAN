States.1741 Chief Justice Stone found that enemy combatants, who
without uniforms come secretly through the lines during time of war,
for the purpose of committing hostile acts, are not entitled to the
status of prisoners of war but are unlawful combatants punishable
by military tribunals. Because this use of military tribunals was
sanctioned by Congress, the Court has found it unnecessary to de-
cide whether “the President may constitutionally convene military
commissions ‘without the sanction of Congress’s in cases of ‘control-
ling necessity.’ ” 1742
     Eminent Domain.—An oft-cited dictum uttered shortly after
the Mexican War asserted the right of an owner to compensation
for property destroyed to prevent its falling into the hands of the
enemy, or for that taken for public use.1743 In United States v. Rus-
sell, decided following the Civil War, a similar conclusion was based
squarely on the Fifth Amendment, although the case did not neces-
sarily involve the point. Finally, in United States v. Pacific Rail-

was not responsible for the injury or destruction of private prop-

taken. . . . although the seizure and appropriation of private prop-
erty under such circumstances by the military authorities may not
be within the terms of the constitutional clauses.” 1745
    Meanwhile, however, in 1874, a committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives, in an elaborate report on war claims growing out of
the Civil War, had voiced the opinion that the Fifth Amendment
embodies the distinction between a taking of property in the course
of military operations or other urgent military necessity, and other
takings for war purposes, and required compensation of owners in
the latter class of cases.1746 In determining what constitutes just
compensation for property requisitioned for war purposes during World
War II, the Court has assumed that the Fifth Amendment is appli-
