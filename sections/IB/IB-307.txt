vert,1713 however, Justice Black asserted in a plurality opinion that
wherever the United States acts it must do so only “in accordance
with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution. . . . [C]onsti-
tutional protections for the individual were designed to restrict the
United States Government when it acts outside of this country, as
well as at home.” 1714 The case, however, involved the trial of a United
States citizen abroad and the language quoted was not subscribed
to by a majority of the Court; thus, it must be regarded as a ques-
tionable rejection of the previous line of cases.1715
     Enemy Property.—In Brown v. United States,1716 Chief Jus-
tice Marshall dealt definitively with the legal position of enemy prop-
erty during wartime. He held that the mere declaration of war by
Congress does not effect a confiscation of enemy property situated
within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, but the right
of Congress by further action to subject such property to confisca-
tion was asserted in the most positive terms. As an exercise of the
war power, such confiscation was held not subject to the restric-
tions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Since such confiscation
is unrelated to the personal guilt of the owner, it is immaterial whether
the property belongs to an alien, a neutral, or even to a citizen.
The whole doctrine of confiscation is built upon the foundation that
it is an instrument of coercion, which, by depriving an enemy of
property within his reach, whether within his territory or outside
it, impairs his ability to resist the confiscating government and at
the same furnishes to that government means for carrying on the
war.1717
    Prizes of War.—The power of Congress with respect to prizes
is plenary; no one can have any interest in prizes captured except
by permission of Congress.1718 Nevertheless, since international law
is a part of our law, the Court will administer it so long as it has
not been modified by treaty or by legislative or executive action.
Thus, during the Civil War, the Court found that the Confiscation
Act of 1861, and the Supplementary Act of 1863, which, in autho-
rizing the condemnation of vessels, made provision for the protec-
    1713 354 U.S. 1 (1957).
