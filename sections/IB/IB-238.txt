embodied in a collective-bargaining agreement, perhaps as inter-
preted in an arbitration proceeding.1250
    Here, too, the permissible role of state tort actions has been in
great dispute. Generally, a state tort action as an alternative to a
§ 301 arbitration or enforcement action is preempted if it is substan-
tially dependent upon analysis of the terms of a collective-
bargaining agreement.1251 Thus, a state damage action for the bad-
faith handling of an insurance claim under a disability plan that
was part of a collective-bargaining agreement was preempted be-
cause it involved interpretation of that agreement and because state
enforcement would frustrate the policies of § 301 favoring uniform
federal-law interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements and
favoring arbitration as a predicate to adjudication.1252
    Finally, the Court has indicated that, with regard to some situ-
ations, Congress has intended to leave the parties to a labor dis-
pute free to engage in “self-help,” so that conduct not subject to fed-
eral law is nonetheless withdrawn from state control.1253 However,
the NLRA is concerned primarily “with establishing an equitable
process for determining terms and conditions of employment, and
not with particular substantive terms of the bargain that is struck
when the parties are negotiating from relatively equal positions,”
so states are free to impose minimum labor standards.1254
