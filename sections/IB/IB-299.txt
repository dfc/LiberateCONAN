val forces” from its grand jury provision, and there is an implica-
tion that these cases are also excepted from the Sixth Amend-
ment.1647 The double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment
appears to apply.1648 The Court of Military Appeals now holds that
servicemen are entitled to all constitutional rights except those ex-
pressly or by implication inapplicable to the military.1649 The Uni-
form Code of Military Justice, supplemented by the Manual for Courts-
Martial, affirmatively grants due process rights roughly comparable
to civilian procedures, so it is unlikely that many issues necessitat-
ing constitutional will arise.1650 However, the Code leaves intact much
of the criticized traditional structure of courts-martial, including the
pervasive possibilities of command influence,1651 and the Court of
Military Appeals is limited on the scope of its review,1652 thus cre-
ating areas in which constitutional challenges are likely.
     Upholding Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice, the Court stressed the special status of military soci-
ety.1653 This difference has resulted in a military Code regulating
aspects of the conduct of members of the military that in the civil-
ian sphere would go unregulated, but on the other hand the penal-
ties imposed range from the severe to well below the threshold of
that possible in civilian life. Because of these factors, the Court,
while agreeing that constitutional limitations applied to military jus-
tice, was of the view that the standards of constitutional guaran-
tees were significantly different in the military than in civilian life.
Thus, the vagueness challenge to the Articles was held to be gov-
erned by the standard applied to criminal statutes regulating eco-
nomic affairs, the most lenient of vagueness standards.1654 Nor did

317 U.S. 1, 40 (1942). The matter was raised but left unresolved in Middendorf v.
Henry, 425 U.S. 25 (1976).
     1648 See Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684 (1949). Cf. Grafton v. United States, 206

U.S. 333 (1907).

States v. Tempia, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249 (1967). This conclusion by the
Court of Military Appeals is at least questioned and perhaps disapproved in Mid-
dendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25, 43–48 (1976), in the course of overturning a CMA
rule that counsel was required in summary court-martial. For the CMA’s response
to the holding, see United States v. Booker, 5 M. J. 238 (C.M.A. 1977), rev’d in part
on reh., 5 M. J. 246 (C.M.A. 1978).

jeopardy, and warnings of rights prior to interrogation, to name a few.

     1653 Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974). Article 133 punishes a commissioned

officer for “conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman,” and Article 134 punishes
any person subject to the Code for “all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of
good order and discipline in the armed forces.”
