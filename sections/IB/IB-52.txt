attached to a forthright claim of the privilege, it should have re-
quested him to state specifically the ground of his refusal to testify.
Another witness, who was threatened with prosecution for his Com-
munist activities, could claim the privilege even to some questions
the answers to which he might have been able to explain away as
unrelated to criminal conduct; if an answer might tend to be incrimi-
natory, the witness is not deprived of the privilege merely because
he might have been able to refute inferences of guilt.252 In still an-
other case, the Court held that the committee had not clearly over-
ruled the claim of privilege and directed an answer.253
    The privilege against self-incrimination is not available as a de-
fense to an organizational officer who refuses to turn over organiza-
tion documents and records to an investigating committee.254
    In Hutcheson v. United States,255 the Court rejected a chal-
lenge to a Senate committee inquiry into union corruption on the
part of a witness who was under indictment in state court on charges
relating to the same matters about which the committee sought to
interrogate him. The witness did not plead his privilege against self-
incrimination but contended that, by questioning him about mat-
ters that would aid the state prosecutor, the committee had denied
him due process. The plurality opinion of the Court rejected his ground
for refusing to answer, noting that, if the committee’s public hear-
ings rendered the witness’ state trial unfair, then he could properly
raise that issue on review of his state conviction.256
    Claims relating to the First Amendment have been frequently
asserted and as frequently denied. It is not that the First Amend-
ment is inapplicable to congressional investigations, it is that, un-
der the prevailing Court interpretation, the First Amendment does

     256 Justice Harlan wrote the opinion of the Court which Justices Clark and Stew-

art joined. Justice Brennan concurred solely because the witness had not claimed
the privilege against self-incrimination but he would have voted to reverse the con-
viction had there been a claim. Chief Justice Warren and Justice Douglas dissented
on due process grounds. Justices Black, Frankfurter, and White did not participate.
At the time of the decision, the Self-incrimination Clause did not restrain the states
through the Fourteenth Amendment, so that it was no violation of the clause for
either the Federal Government or the states to compel testimony which would in-
criminate the witness in the other jurisdiction. Cf. United States v. Murdock, 284
U.S. 141 (1931); Knapp v. Schweitzer, 357 U.S. 371 (1958). The Court has since re-
versed itself, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964); Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n,
378 U.S. 52 (1964), thus leaving the vitality of Hutcheson doubtful.
