often witnessed retreats and advances.1045 In any event, both taxa-
tion and regulation now are evaluated under a judicial balancing
formula comparing the burden on interstate commerce with the im-
portance of the state interest, save for discriminatory state action
that cannot be justified at all.
     Taxation.—During the 1940s and 1950s, there was conflict within
the Court between the view that interstate commerce could not be
taxed at all, at least “directly,” and the view that the negative com-
merce clause protected against the risk of double taxation.1046 In
Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota,1047 the Court
reasserted the principle expressed earlier in Western Live Stock, that
the Framers did not intend to immunize interstate commerce from
its just share of the state tax burden even though it increased the
cost of doing business.1048 Northwestern States held that a state could
constitutionally impose a nondiscriminatory, fairly apportioned net
income tax on an out-of-state corporation engaged exclusively in in-
terstate commerce in the taxing state. “For the first time outside
the context of property taxation, the Court explicitly recognized that
an exclusively interstate business could be subjected to the states’
taxing powers.” 1049 Thus, in Northwestern States, foreign corpora-
tions that maintained a sales office and employed sales staff in the
taxing state for solicitation of orders for their merchandise that, upon
acceptance of the orders at their home office in another jurisdic-
tion, were shipped to customers in the taxing state, were held li-
able to pay the latter’s income tax on that portion of the net in-
come of their interstate business as was attributable to such
solicitation.
    Yet, the following years saw inconsistent rulings that turned al-
most completely upon the use of or failure to use “magic words” by
legislative drafters. That is, it was constitutional for the states to
tax a corporation’s net income, properly apportioned to the taxing
state, as in Northwestern States, but no state could levy a tax on a
foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business in the state,
     1045 Indeed, scholars dispute just when the modern standard was firmly ad-

opted. The conventional view is that it was articulated in Complete Auto Transit,
Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), but there also seems little doubt that the founda-
tion of the present law was laid in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Min-
nesota, 358 U.S. 450 (1959).

Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. 250, 258, 260 (1938).
     1047 358 U.S. 450 (1959).
     1048 358 U.S. at 461–62. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S.

250, 254 (1938). For recent reiterations of the principle, see Quill Corp. v. North
Dakota ex rel. Heitkamp, 504 U.S. 298, 310 n.5 (1992) (citing cases).
