period the power of inquiry—with enforcing process—was regarded
and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power
to legislate—indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is
ample warrant for thinking, as we do, that the constitutional provi-
sions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are
intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may
be effectively exercised.” 191
    Even a 1957 opinion by Chief Justice Warren which was gener-
ally hostile to the exercise of the investigatory power in the post-
World War II years did not question this basic power. “The power
of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legisla-
tive process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concern-
ing the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or pos-
sibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our social,
economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Con-
gress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of
the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency or waste.” 192
Justice Harlan summarized the matter in 1959: “The power of in-
quiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over
the whole range of the national interests concerning which Con-
gress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legis-
late; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropri-
ate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate. The scope
of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and far-reaching
as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Consti-
tution.” 193
    Broad as the power of inquiry is, it is not unlimited. The power
of investigation may properly be employed only “in aid of the legis-
lative function.” 194 Its outermost boundaries are marked, then, by
the outermost boundaries of the power to legislate. In principle, the
Court is clear on the limitations, clear “that neither house of Con-
gress possesses a ‘general power of making inquiry into the private
affairs of the citizen’; that the power actually possessed is limited
to inquiries relating to matters of which the particular house ‘has
jurisdiction’ and in respect of which it rightfully may take other ac-
tion; that if the inquiry relates to ‘a matter wherein relief or re-
dress could be had only by a judicial proceeding’ it is not within
the range of this power, but must be left to the courts, conformably
to the constitutional separation of governmental powers; and that
