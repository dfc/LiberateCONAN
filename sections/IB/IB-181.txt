area of free trade, so that unreasonable burdens on interstate com-
merce violate the clause in and of themselves.973
    Nonetheless, the power of the Court is established and is freely
exercised. No reservations can be discerned in the opinions for the
Court.974 Individual Justices, to be sure, have urged renunciation
of the power and remission to Congress for relief sought by liti-
gants,975 but that has not been the course followed.
    The State Proprietary Activity (Market Participant) Ex-
ception.—In a case of first impression, the Court held that a Mary-
land bounty scheme by which the state paid scrap processors for
each “hulk” automobile destroyed is “the kind of action with which
     973 E.g., Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434, 440 (1939); McLeod

v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U.S. 327, 330–31 (1944); Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U.S. 249,
252, 256 (1946); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 538, 539 (1949);
Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 447–50 (1991). “[W]e have steadfastly adhered to
the central tenet that the Commerce Clause ‘by its own force created an area of
trade free from interference by the States.’ ” American Trucking Ass’ns v. Scheiner,
483 U.S. 266, 280 (1987) (quoting Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429
U.S. 318, 328 (1977)).
     974 E.g., Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Natural Resources Dep’t,

504 U.S. 353, 359 (1992); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992); Wyo-
ming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 455 (1992). Indeed, the Court, in Dennis v. Hig-
gins, 498 U.S. 439, 447–50 (1991), broadened its construction of the clause, holding
that it confers a “right” upon individuals and companies to engage in interstate trade.
With respect to the exercise of the power, the Court has recognized Congress’s greater
expertise to act and noted its hesitancy to impose uniformity on state taxation. Moor-
man Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267, 280 (1978). Cf. Quill Corp., 504 U.S. at 318.
     975 In McCarroll v. Dixie Lines, 309 U.S. 176, 183 (1940), Justice Black, for him-

self and Justices Frankfurter and Douglas, dissented, taking precisely this view. See
also Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, 304 U.S. 307, 316 (1938) (Justice Black dissenting in
part); Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434, 442 (1939) (Justice
Black dissenting); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761, 784 (1945) (Justice
Black dissenting); id. at 795 (Justice Douglas dissenting). Justices Douglas and Frank-
furter subsequently wrote and joined opinions applying the dormant commerce clause.
In Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U.S. 157, 166 (1954), the Court
rejected the urging that it uphold all not-patently discriminatory taxes and let Con-
gress deal with conflicts. More recently, Justice Scalia has taken the view that, as a
matter of original intent, a “dormant” or “negative” commerce power cannot be jus-
tified in either taxation or regulation cases, but, yielding to the force of precedent,
he will vote to strike down state actions that discriminate against interstate com-
merce or that are governed by the Court’s precedents, without extending any of those
precedents. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U.S. 69, 94 (1987) (concur-
ring); Tyler Pipe Indus. v. Washington State Dep’t of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 259
(1987) (concurring in part and dissenting in part); Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco
Enterprises, Inc., 486 U.S. 888 (1988) (concurring in judgment); American Trucking
Assn’s v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167 (1990) (concurring); Itel Containers Int’l Corp. v. Hud-
dleston, 507 U.S. 60, 78 (1993) (Justice Scalia concurring) (reiterating view); Okla-
homa Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.., 514 U.S. 175, 200–01 (1995) (Justice
Scalia, with Justice Thomas joining) (same). Justice Thomas has written an exten-
sive opinion rejecting both the historical and jurisprudential basis of the dormant
commerce clause and expressing a preference for reliance on the imports-exports clause.
Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 609 (1997) (dis-
senting; joined by Justice Scalia entirely and by Chief Justice Rehnquist as to the
Commerce Clause but not the Imports-Exports Clause).
