report within the body was protected, whereas dissemination in nor-
mal channels outside it was not.445
    Bifurcation of the legislative process in this way resulted in hold-
ing unprotected the republication by a Member of allegedly defama-
tory remarks outside the legislative body, here through newsletters
and press releases.446 The clause protects more than speech or de-
bate in either House, the Court affirmed, but in order for the other
matters to be covered “they must be an integral part of the delib-
erative and communicative processes by which Members partici-
pate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the con-
sideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with
respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the
jurisdiction of either House.” 447 Press releases and newsletters are
“[v]aluable and desirable” in “inform[ing] the public and other Mem-
bers,” but neither are essential to the deliberations of the legisla-
tive body nor part of the deliberative process.448
    Parallel developments may be discerned with respect to the ap-
plication of a general criminal statute to call into question the leg-
islative conduct and motivation of a Member. Thus, in United States
v. Johnson,449 the Court voided the conviction of a Member for con-
spiracy to impair lawful governmental functions, in the course of
seeking to divert a governmental inquiry into alleged wrongdoing,
by accepting a bribe to make a speech on the floor of the House of
Representatives. The speech was charged as part of the conspiracy
and extensive evidence concerning it was introduced at a trial. It


     445 It is difficult to assess the effect of the decision because the Justices in the

majority adopted mutually inconsistent stands, 412 U.S. at 325 (concurring opin-
ion), and four Justices dissented. Id. at 331, 332, 338. The case also leaves unre-
solved the propriety of injunctive relief. Compare id. at 330 (Justice Douglas concur-
ring), with id. at 343–45 (three dissenters arguing that separation of powers doctrine
forbade injunctive relief). And compare Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 245, 246
n.24 (1979), with id. at 250–51 (Chief Justice Burger dissenting).
     446 Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111 (1979).
     447 443 U.S. at 126, quoting Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 625 (1972).
     448 Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 130, 132–33 (1979). The Court distin-

guished between the more important “informing” function of Congress, i.e., its ef-
forts to inform itself in order to exercise its legislative powers, and the less impor-
tant “informing” function of acquainting the public about its activities. The latter
function the Court did not find an integral part of the legislative process. See also
Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 314–17 (1973). But compare id. at 325 (concurring).
For consideration of the “informing” function in its different guises in the context of
legislative investigations, see Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 200 (1957);
United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 43 (1953); Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.
749, 777–78 (1962) (Justice Douglas dissenting).
     449 383 U.S. 169 (1966).
