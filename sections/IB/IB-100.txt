       cancellation of each item would “(i) reduce the Federal budget defi-
       cit; (ii) not impair any essential Government functions; and (iii) not
       harm the national interest.” 524 In Clinton v. City of New York,525
       the Court held the Act unconstitutional because it did not comply
       with the Presentment Clause.
            Although Congress in passing the Act considered itself to have
       been delegating power,526 and although the dissenting Justices would
       have upheld the Act as a valid delegation,527 the Court instead ana-
       lyzed the statute under the Presentment Clause. In the Court’s view,
       the two bills from which the President subsequently struck items
       became law the moment the President signed them. His cancella-
       tions thus amended and in part repealed the two federal laws. Un-
       der its most immediate precedent, the Court continued, statutory
       repeals must conform to the Presentment Clause’s “single, finely
       wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure” for enacting or re-
       pealing a law.528 In no respect did the procedures in the Act comply
       with that clause, and in no way could they. The President was act-
       ing in a legislative capacity, altering a law in the manner pre-
       scribed, and legislation must, in the way Congress acted, be bicam-
       eral and be presented to the President after Congress acted. Nothing
       in the Constitution authorized the President to amend or repeal a
       statute unilaterally, and the Court could construe both constitu-
       tional silence and the historical practice over 200 years as “an ex-
       press prohibition” of the President’s action.529
