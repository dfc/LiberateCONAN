thought the statute to be an appropriate exercise of the power of
Congress to legislate for the District of Columbia pursuant to this
clause without regard to Article III.1789 Two others thought that
Hepburn v. Ellzey had been erroneously decided and would have
overruled it.1790 But six Justices rejected the former rationale and
seven Justices rejected the latter one; since five Justices agreed, how-
ever, that the statute was constitutional, it was sustained.
    It is not disputed that the District is a part of the United States
and that its residents are entitled to all the guarantees of the United
States Constitution including the privilege of trial by jury 1791 and
of presentment by a grand jury.1792 Legislation restrictive of liberty
and property in the District must find justification in facts ad-
equate to support like legislation by a state in the exercise of its
police power.1793
     Congress possesses over the District of Columbia the blended
powers of a local and national legislature.1794 This fact means that
in some respects ordinary constitutional restrictions do not oper-
ate; thus, for example, in creating local courts of local jurisdiction
in the District, Congress acts pursuant to its legislative powers un-
der clause 17 and need not create courts that comply with Article
III court requirements.1795 And when legislating for the District Con-

1970, Pub. L. 91–358, 111, 84 Stat. 475, D.C. Code, § 11–101, Congress specifically
declared it was acting pursuant to Article I in creating the Superior Court and the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals and pursuant to Article III in continuing the
United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia. The Article I courts were sustained in Palmore v. United States, 411
U.S. 389 (1973). See also Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372 (1977). The latter, federal
courts, while Article III courts, traditionally have had some non-Article III func-
tions imposed on them, under the “hybrid” theory announced in O’Donoghue v. United
States, 289 U.S. 516 (1933). E.g., Hobson v. Hansen, 265 F. Supp. 902 (D.D.C. 1967),
appeal dismissed, 393 U.S. 801 (1968) (power then vested in District Court to ap-
point school board members). See also Keller v. Potomac Elec. Co., 261 U.S. 428 (1923);
Embry v. Palmer, 107 U.S. 3 (1883).
