tions with the power of eminent domain in the states; and fourth,
it may exempt their franchises from state taxation.740
    Federal Regulation of Land Transportation.—Congressio-
nal regulation of railroads may be said to have begun in 1866. By
the Garfield Act, Congress authorized all railroad companies oper-
ating by steam to interconnect with each other “so as to form con-
tinuous lines for the transportation of passengers, freight, troops,
governmental supplies, and mails, to their destination.” 741 An act
of the same year provided federal chartering and protection from
conflicting state regulations to companies formed to construct and
operate telegraph lines.742 Another act regulated the transporta-
tion by railroad of livestock so as to preserve the health and safety
of the animals.743
    Congress’s entry into the rate regulation field was preceded by
state attempts to curb the abuses of the rail lines in the Middle
West, which culminated in the “Granger Movement.” Because the
businesses were locally owned, the Court at first upheld state laws
as not constituting a burden on interstate commerce; 744 but after
the various business panics of the 1870s and 1880s drove numer-
ous small companies into bankruptcy and led to consolidation, there
emerged great interstate systems. Thus in 1886, the Court held that
a state may not set charges for carriage even within its own bound-
aries of goods brought from without the state or destined to points
outside it; that power was exclusively with Congress.745 In the fol-
lowing year, Congress passed the original Interstate Commerce Act.746
A Commission was authorized to pass upon the “reasonableness” of
all rates by railroads for the transportation of goods or persons in
interstate commerce and to order the discontinuance of all charges
found to be “unreasonable.” In ICC v. Brimson,747 the Court upheld

     740 Thomson v. Pacific R.R., 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 579 (1870); California v. Pacific

R.R. Co. (Pacific Ry. Cases), 127 U.S. 1 (1888); Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas
Ry., 135 U.S. 641 (1890); Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U.S. 525 (1894).
     741 14 Stat. 66 (1866).
     742 14 Stat. 221 (1866).
     743 17 Stat. 353 (1873).
     744 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1877); Chicago B. & Q. R. Co. v. Iowa, 94 U.S.

155 (1877); Peik v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., 94 U.S. 164 (1877); Pickard v. Pullman South-
ern Car Co., 117 U.S. 34 (1886).
     745 Wabash, St. L. & P. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886). A variety of state

regulations have been struck down on the burdening-of-commerce rationale. E.g.,
Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U.S. 761 (1945) (train length);
Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 272 U.S. 605 (1926) (locomotive accessories); Penn-
sylvania R.R. v. Public Service Comm’n, 250 U.S. 566 (1919). But the Court has largely
exempted regulations with a safety purpose, even a questionable one. Brotherhood
of Firemen v. Chicago, R.I. & P. R.R., 393 U.S. 129 (1968).
     746 24 Stat. 379 (1887).
     747 154 U.S. 447, 470 (1894).
