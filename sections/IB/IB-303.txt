    Other legislation is designed to effect a transition from war to
peace. The war power “is not limited to victories in the field. . . .
It carries with it inherently the power to guard against the imme-
diate renewal of the conflict, and to remedy the evils which have
arisen from its rise and progress.” 1684 This principle was given a
much broader application after the First World War in Hamilton v.
Kentucky Distilleries, Co.,1685 where the War Time Prohibition Act 1686
adopted after the signing of the Armistice was upheld as an appro-
priate measure for increasing war efficiency. The Court was unable
to conclude that the war emergency had passed with the cessation
of hostilities.1687 But in 1924, it held that a rent control law for the
District of Columbia, which had been previously upheld,1688 had ceased
to operate because the emergency which justified it had come to an
end.1689
    A similar issue was presented after World War II, and the Court
held that the authority of Congress to regulate rents by virtue of
the war power did not end with the presidential proclamation ter-
minating hostilities on December 31, 1946.1690 However, the Court
cautioned that “[w]e recognize the force of the argument that the
effects of war under modern conditions may be felt in the economy
for years and years, and that if the war power can be used in days
of peace to treat all the wounds which war inflicts on our society, it
may not only swallow up all other powers of Congress but largely
obliterate the Ninth and Tenth Amendments as well. There are no
such implications in today’s decision.” 1691
     In the same year, the Court sustained by only a five-to-four vote
the Government’s contention that the power which Congress had
conferred upon the President to deport enemy aliens in times of a
declared war was not exhausted when the shooting stopped.1692 “It
is not for us to question,” said Justice Frankfurter for the Court, “a
belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed
fit subjects for internment during active hostilites [sic] do not lose
their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and con-
