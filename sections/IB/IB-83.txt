House by one of its members in relation to the business before it.’ ” 437
Thus, so long as legislators are “acting in the sphere of legitimate
legislative activity,” they are “protected not only from the conse-
quence of litigation’s results but also from the burden of defending
themselves.” 438 But the scope of the meaning of “legislative activ-
ity” has its limits. “The heart of the clause is speech or debate in
either House, and insofar as the clause is construed to reach other
matters, they must be an integral part of the deliberative and com-
municative processes by which Members participate in committee
and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and pas-
sage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other mat-
ters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either
House.” 439 Immunity from civil suit, both in law and equity, and
from criminal action based on the performance of legislative duties
flows from a determination that a challenged act is within the defi-
nition of legislative activity, but the Court in the more recent cases
appears to have narrowed the concept somewhat.
    In Kilbourn v. Thompson,440 Members of the House of Represen-
tatives were held immune in a suit for false imprisonment brought
about by a vote of the Members on a resolution charging contempt
of one of its committees and under which the plaintiff was arrested
and detained, even though the Court found that the contempt was
wrongly voted. Kilbourn was relied on in Powell v. McCormack,441
in which the plaintiff was not allowed to maintain an action for de-
claratory judgment against certain Members of the House of Repre-
sentatives to challenge his exclusion by a vote of the entire House.
Because the power of inquiry is so vital to performance of the legis-
lative function, the Court held that the clause precluded suit against
the Chairman and Members of a Senate subcommittee and staff per-
sonnel, to enjoin enforcement of a subpoena directed to a third party,
     437 Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 502 (1969), quoting Kilbourn v. Thomp-

son, 103 U.S. 168, 204 (1881).
     438 Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376–377 (1972); Dombrowski v. Eastland,

387 U.S. 82, 85 (1967); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 505 (1969); Eastland v.
United States Servicemen’s Fund, 421 U.S. 491, 503 (1975).
     439 Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 625 (1972). The critical nature of the

clause is shown by the holding in Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 235 n.11 (1979),
that when a Member is sued under the Fifth Amendment for employment discrimi-
nation on the basis of gender, only the clause could shield such an employment de-
cision, and not the separation of powers doctrine or emanations from it. Whether
the clause would be a shield the Court had no occasion to decide and the case was
settled on remand without a decision being reached.
     440 103 U.S. 168 (1881). But see Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 618–19

(1972).
     441 395 U.S. 486 (1969). The Court found sufficient the presence of other defen-

dants to enable it to review Powell’s exclusion but reserved the question whether in
the absence of someone the clause would still preclude suit. Id. at 506 n.26. See also
Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 204 (1881).
