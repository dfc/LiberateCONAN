when the act was committed.” 2013 The bar is directed only against
legislative action and does not touch erroneous or inconsistent deci-
sions by the courts.2014
    The fact that a law is ex post facto and invalid as to crimes
committed prior to its enactment does not affect its validity as to
subsequent offenses.2015 A statute that mitigates the rigor of the law
in force at the time the crime was committed,2016 or merely penal-
izes the continuance of conduct lawfully begun before its passage,
is not ex post facto. Thus, measures penalizing the failure of a rail-
road to cut drains through existing embankments 2017 or making il-
legal the continued possession of intoxicating liquors which were
lawfully acquired 2018 have been held valid.
    Denial of Future Privileges to Past Offenders.—The right
to practice a profession may be denied to one who was convicted of
an offense before the statute was enacted if the offense reasonably
may be regarded as a continuing disqualification for the profession.
Without offending the Constitution, statutes barring a person from
practicing medicine after conviction of a felony,2019 or excluding con-
victed felons from waterfront union offices unless pardoned or in
receipt of a parole board’s good conduct certificate,2020 may be en-
forced against a person convicted before the measures were passed.
But the test oath prescribed after the Civil War, under which office
holders, attorneys, teachers, clergymen, and others were required
to swear that they had not participated in the rebellion or ex-
pressed sympathy for it, was held invalid on the ground that it had
no reasonable relation to fitness to perform official or professional
     2013 Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42 (1990) (quoting Beazell v. Ohio, 269

U.S. 167, 169–70 (1925)). Alternatively, the Court described the reach of the clause
as extending to laws that “alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment
for criminal acts.” Id. at 43. Justice Chase’s oft-cited formulation has a fourth cat-
egory: “every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when
committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798), cited in, e.g., Carmell v.
Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 522 (2000).
     2014 Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 344 (1915); Ross v. Oregon, 227 U.S. 150,

161 (1913). However, an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute so
as to encompass conduct not covered on the face of the statute operates like an ex
post facto law if it is applied retroactively and violates due process in that event.
Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347 (1964). See Marks v. United States, 430
U.S. 188 (1977) (applying Bouie in context of § 9, cl. 3). But see Splawn v. Califor-
nia, 431 U.S. 595 (1977) (rejecting application of Bouie). The Court itself has not
always adhered to this standard. See Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463 (1966).
