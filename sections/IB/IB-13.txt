sis for all separation of power cases or it may turn out to be but an
exception to the Court’s dual approach.18
    Although the two analytical approaches have been character-
ized in various ways, the names generally attached to them have
been “formalist” (applied to the more strict line of cases), and “func-
tional” (applied to the less strict). The formalist approach empha-
sizes the necessity of maintaining three distinct branches of govern-
ment by drawing bright lines demarcating them and distinguishing
amongst them based on their respective roles.19 The functional ap-
proach emphasizes the core functions of each branch and asks whether
the challenged action threatens the essential attributes of such branch’s
functions. Under this approach, there is considerable flexibility af-
forded the moving branch—usually Congress acting to make struc-
tural or institutional change—if there is little significant risk of im-
pairment of a core function or if there is a compelling reason for
the action.20
     18 The tenor of a later case, Metropolitan Washington Airports Auth. v. Citizens

for the Abatement of Airport Noise, 501 U.S. 252 (1991), was decidedly formalistic,
but it involved a factual situation and a doctrinal predicate easily rationalized by
the principles of Morrison and Mistretta, aggrandizement of its powers by Congress.
Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33 (1989), reasserted the fundamental
status of Marathon, again in a bankruptcy courts context, although the issue was
the right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment rather than strictly speak-
ing a separation-of-powers question. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991),
pursued a straightforward appointments-clause analysis, informed by a separation-
of-powers analysis but not governed by it. Finally, in Public Citizen v. U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 467 (1989) (concurring), Justice Kennedy would have
followed the formalist approach, but he explicitly grounded it on the distinction be-
tween an express constitutional vesting of power as against implicit vestings. Sepa-
rately, the Court has for some time viewed the standing requirement for access to
judicial review as reflecting a separation-of-powers component—confining the courts
to their proper sphere – Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984), but that view
seemed largely superfluous to the conceptualization of standing rules. However, in
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 577 (1992), the Court imported the
take-care clause, obligating the President to see to the faithful execution of the laws,
into standing analysis, creating a substantial barrier to congressional decisions to
provide for judicial review of executive actions. It is not at all clear, however, that
the effort, by Justice Scalia, enjoys the support of a majority of the Court. Id. at
579–81 (Justices Kennedy and Souter concurring). The cited cases seem to demon-
strate that a strongly formalistic wing of the Court continues to exist.
     19 “The hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to ex-

ceed the outer limits of its power . . . must be resisted. Although not ‘hermetically’
sealed from one another, the powers delegated to the three Branches are function-
ally identifiable.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983). See id. at 944–51; North-
ern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 64–66 (1982)
(plurality opinion); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721–727 (1986).
     20 CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. Prod-

ucts Co., 473 U.S. 568, 587, 589–93 (1985). The Court had first formulated this analy-
sis in cases challenging alleged infringements on presidential powers, United States
v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 713 (1974); Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433
U.S. 425, 442–43 (1977), but it had subsequently turned to the more strict test. Schor
and Thomas both involved provisions challenged as infringing judicial powers.
