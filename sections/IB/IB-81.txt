             COMPENSATION AND IMMUNITIES OF MEMBERS

       Congressional Pay
            With the surprise ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amend-
       ment,422 it is now the rule that congressional legislation “varying”—
       decreasing or increasing—the level of legislators’ pay may not take
       effect until an intervening election has occurred. The only real con-
       troversy likely to arise in the interpretation of the new rule is whether
       pay increases that result from automatic alterations in pay are sub-
       ject to the same requirement or whether it is only the initial enact-
       ment of the automatic device that is covered. That is, from the found-
       ing to 1967, congressional pay was determined directly by Congress
       in specific legislation setting specific rates of pay. In 1967, a law
       was passed that created a quadrennial commission with the respon-
       sibility to propose to the President salary levels for top officials of
       the Government, including Members of Congress.423 In 1975, Con-
       gress legislated to bring Members of Congress within a separate
       commission system authorizing the President to recommend an-
       nual increases for civil servants to maintain pay comparability with
       private-sector employees.424 These devices were attacked by dissent-
       ing Members of Congress as violating the mandate of clause 1 that
       compensation be “ascertained by Law.” However, these challenges
       were rejected.425 Thereafter, prior to ratification of the Amend-
       ment, Congress, in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989,426 altered both
       the pay-increase and the cost-of-living-increase provisions of law, mak-
       ing quadrennial pay increases effective only after an intervening con-
       gressional election and making cost-of-living increases dependent upon
       a specific congressional vote. A federal court of appeals panel ruled
       that the cost-of-living-increase provision did not violate the Twenty-
       Seventh Amendment, and that a challenge to the quadrennial pay
       raise provision was not ripe.427
