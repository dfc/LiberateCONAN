for the purpose of determining the essential character of the in-

    In practice, much of the litigated dispute has been about the
reach of the power to inquire into the activities of private citizens;
inquiry into the administration of laws and departmental corrup-
tion, while of substantial political consequence, has given rise to
fewer judicial precedents.

Investigations of Conduct of Executive Department
    For many years the investigating function of Congress was lim-
ited to inquiries into the administration of the Executive Depart-
ment or of instrumentalities of the Government. Until the adminis-
tration of Andrew Jackson this power was not seriously challenged.196
During the controversy over renewal of the charter of the Bank of
the United States, John Quincy Adams contended that an unlim-
ited inquiry into the operations of the bank would be beyond the
power of the House.197 Four years later the legislative power of in-
vestigation was challenged by the President. A committee ap-
pointed by the House of Representatives “with power to send for
persons and papers, and with instructions to inquire into the condi-
tion of the various executive departments, the ability and integrity
with which they have been conducted, . . . ” 198 called upon the Presi-
dent and the heads of departments for lists of persons appointed
without the consent of the Senate and the amounts paid to them.
Resentful of this attempt “to invade the just rights of the Execu-
tive Departments,” the President refused to comply and the major-
ity of the committee acquiesced.199
     Nevertheless, congressional investigations of Executive Depart-
ments have continued to the present day. Shortly before the Civil
War, contempt proceedings against a witness who refused to testify
in an investigation of John Brown’s raid upon the arsenal at Harp-
er’s Ferry occasioned a thorough consideration by the Senate of the
basis of this power. After a protracted debate, which cut sharply
across sectional and party lines, the Senate voted overwhelmingly

the House of Representatives advising them of his resignation from office and invit-
