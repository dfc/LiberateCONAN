the use of this technique to induce governments and private par-
ties to cooperate voluntarily with federal policy.” 624
    The Court has set forth several standards purporting to chan-
nel Congress’s discretion in attaching grant conditions.625 To date
only one statute, discussed below, has been struck down as violat-
ing these standards, although several statutes have been inter-
preted so as to conform to the guiding principles. First, the condi-
tions, like the spending itself, must advance the general welfare,
but the determination of what constitutes the general welfare rests
largely if not wholly with Congress.626 Second, because a grant is
“much in the nature of a contract” offer that the states may accept
or reject,627 Congress must set out the conditions unambiguously,
so that the states may make an informed decision.628 Third, the Court
continues to state that the conditions must be related to the fed-
eral interest for which the funds are expended,629 but it has never
found a spending condition deficient under this part of the test.630
Fourth, the power to condition funds may not be used to induce
the states to engage in activities that would themselves be uncon-
stitutional.631 Fifth, the Court has suggested that in some circum-
stances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so

     627 Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186 (2002) (holding that neither the Ameri-

cans With Disabilities Act of 1990 nor section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
subjected states to punitive damages in private actions).
     628 South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. at 207. The requirement appeared in Pen-

nhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). See also Atascadero
State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 246 (1985) (Rehabilitation Act does not clearly
signal states that participation in programs funded by Act constitutes waiver of im-
munity from suit in federal court); Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002) (no
private right of action was created by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act); Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006)
(because Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which was enacted pursuant
to the Spending Clause, does not furnish clear notice to states that prevailing par-
ents may recover fees for services rendered by experts in IDEA actions, it does not
authorize recovery of such fees).

     630 The relationship in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. at 208–09, in which Con-

gress conditioned access to certain highway funds on establishing a 21-years-of-age
drinking qualification was that the purpose of both funds and condition was safe
interstate travel. The federal interest in Oklahoma v. Civil Service Comm’n, 330 U.S.
127, 143 (1947), as we have noted, was assuring proper administration of federal
highway funds.
