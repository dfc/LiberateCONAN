        right involved.” 387 The Court has upheld a variety of state laws de-
        signed to ensure that elections—including federal elections—are fair
        and honest and orderly.388 But the Court distinguished state laws
        that go beyond “protection of the integrity and regularity of the elec-
        tion process,” and instead operate to disadvantage a particular class
        of candidates.389 Term limits, viewed as serving the dual purposes
        of “disadvantaging a particular class of candidates and evading the
        dictates of the Qualifications Clause,” crossed this line,390 as did bal-
        lot labels identifying candidates who disregarded voters’ instruc-
        tions on term limits or declined to pledge support for them.391 “[T]he
        Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to
        issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dic-
        tate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates,
        or to evade important constitutional restraints.” 392

    Clause 2. [The Congress shall assemble at least once in ev-
ery Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in De-
cember, unless they shall by law appoint a different Day].393

                                          IN GENERAL
            This Clause was superseded by the Twentieth Amendment.

    SECTION 5. Clause 1. Each House shall be the Judge of the
Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and
a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business;
but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may
be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in
such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may pro-
vide.
