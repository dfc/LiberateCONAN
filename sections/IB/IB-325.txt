Chartering of Banks
    As an appropriate means for executing “the great powers, to lay
and collect taxes; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to de-
clare and conduct a war; and to raise and support armies . . . ,”
Congress may incorporate banks and kindred institutions.1839 More-
over, it may confer upon them private powers, which, standing alone,
have no relation to the functions of the Federal Government, if those
privileges are essential to the effective operation of such corpora-
tions.1840 Where necessary to meet the competition of state banks,
Congress may authorize national banks to perform fiduciary func-
tions, even though, apart from the competitive situation, federal in-
strumentalities might not be permitted to engage in such busi-
ness.1841 The Court will not undertake to assess the relative importance
of the public and private functions of a financial institution Con-
gress has seen fit to create. It sustained the act setting up the Fed-
eral Farm Loan Banks to provide funds for mortgage loans on agri-
cultural land against the contention that the right of the Secretary
of the Treasury, which he had not exercised, to use these banks as
depositories of public funds, was merely a pretext for chartering those
banks for private purposes.1842

Currency Regulations
    Reinforced by the necessary and proper clause, the powers “ ‘to
lay and collect taxes, to pay the debts and provide for the common
defence and general welfare of the United States,’ and ‘to borrow
money on the credit of the United States and to coin money and
regulate the value thereon . . . ,’ ” 1843 have been held to give Con-
gress virtually complete control over money and currency. A prohibi-
tive tax on the notes of state banks,1844 the issuance of treasury
notes impressed with the quality of legal tender in payment of pri-
vate debts 1845 and the abrogation of clauses in private contracts,
which called for payment in gold coin,1846 were sustained as appro-
priate measures for carrying into effect some or all of the foregoing
powers.
