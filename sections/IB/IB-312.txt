to prevent its use by the enemy, it has relied on the principle enun-

    Rent and Price Controls.—Even at a time when the Court
was using substantive due process to void economic regulations, it
generally sustained such regulations in wartime. Thus, shortly fol-
lowing the end of World War I, it sustained, by a narrow margin, a
rent control law for the District of Columbia, which not only lim-
ited permissible rent increases but also permitted existing tenants
to continue in occupancy provided they paid rent and observed other
stipulated conditions.1749 Justice Holmes for the majority conceded
in effect that in the absence of a war emergency the legislation might
transcend constitutional limitations,1750 but noted that “a public exi-
gency will justify the legislature in restricting property rights in
land to a certain extent without compensation.” 1751
    During World War II and thereafter, economic controls were uni-
formly sustained.1752 An apartment house owner who complained
that he was not allowed a “fair return” on the property was dis-
missed with the observation that “a nation which can demand the
lives of its men and women in the waging of . . . war is under no
constitutional necessity of providing a system of price control . . .
which will assure each landlord a ‘fair return’ on his property.” 1753
The Court also held that rental ceilings could be established with-
out a prior hearing when the exigencies of national security pre-
