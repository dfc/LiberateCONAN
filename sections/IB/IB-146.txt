It refused to permit local incidents of a great interstate movement,
which taken alone are intrastate, to characterize the movement as
such.” 794
     Of special significance, however, is the part of the opinion de-
voted to showing the relation between future sales and cash sales,
and hence the effect of the former upon the interstate grain trade.
The test, said the Chief Justice, was furnished by the question of
price. “The question of price dominates trade between the States.
Sales of an article which affect the country-wide price of the article
directly affect the country-wide commerce in it.” 795 Thus, a prac-
tice that demonstrably affects prices would also affect interstate trade
“directly,” and so, even though local in itself, would fall within the
regulatory power of Congress. In the following passage, indeed, Chief
Justice Taft whittled down, in both cases, the “direct-indirect” for-
mula to the vanishing point: “Whatever amounts to more or less
constant practice, and threatens to obstruct or unduly to burden
the freedom of interstate commerce is within the regulatory power
of Congress under the commerce clause, and it is primarily for Con-
gress to consider and decide the fact of the danger to meet it. This
court will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress
in such a matter unless the relation of the subject to interstate com-
merce and its effect upon it are clearly nonexistent.” 796
     It was in reliance on the doctrine of these cases that Congress
first set to work to combat the Depression in 1933 and the years
immediately following. But, in fact, much of its legislation at this
time marked a wide advance upon the measures just passed in re-
view. They did not stop with regulating traffic among the states and
the instrumentalities thereof; they also attempted to govern produc-
tion and industrial relations in the field of production. Confronted
with this expansive exercise of Congress’s power, the Court again
deemed itself called upon to define a limit to the commerce power
that would save to the states their historical sphere, and especially
their customary monopoly of legislative power in relation to indus-
try and labor management.
    Securities and Exchange Commission.—Not all antidepres-
sion legislation, however, was of this new approach. The Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 797 and the Public Utility Company Act
(“Wheeler-Rayburn Act”) of 1935 798 were not. The former created
the Securities and Exchange Commission and authorized it to lay
   794 262 U.S. at 35.
   795 262 U.S. at 40.
   796 262 U.S. at 37, quoting Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495, 521 (1922).
   797 48 Stat. 881, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b et seq.
   798 49 Stat. 803, 15 U.S.C. §§ 79–79z–6.
