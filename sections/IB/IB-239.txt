resurrected and made largely the basis for informing judicial judg-
ment with respect to controversies concerning the rights and obli-
gations of Native Americans. Although Congress in 1871 forbade the
further making of treaties with Indian tribes,1256 cases disputing
the application of the old treaties and especially their effects upon
attempted state taxation and regulation of on-reservation activities
continue to be a staple of the Court’s docket.1257 But this clause is
one of the two bases now found sufficient to empower Federal Gov-
ernment authority over Native Americans. “The source of federal
authority over Indian matters has been the subject of some confu-
sion, but it is now generally recognized that the power derives from
federal responsibility for regulating commerce with Indian tribes and
for treaty making.” 1258
    Forsaking reliance upon other theories and rationales, the Court
has established the preemption doctrine as the analytical frame-
work within which to judge the permissibility of assertions of state
jurisdiction over the Indians. However, the “semi-autonomous sta-
tus” of Indian tribes erects an “independent but related” barrier to
the exercise of state authority over commercial activity on an In-
dian reservation.1259 Thus, the question of preemption is not gov-
erned by the standards of preemption developed in other areas. “In-
stead, the traditional notions of tribal sovereignty, and the recognition
and encouragement of this sovereignty in congressional Acts promot-
ing tribal independence and economic development, inform the pre-
emption analysis that governs this inquiry. . . . As a result, ambi-
guities in federal law should be construed generously, and federal
pre-emption is not limited to those situations where Congress has

the Federal Government had the obligation and thus the power to protect a weak
and dependent people. Cf. United States v. Holiday, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 407 (1866);
United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28 (1913). This special fiduciary responsibility
can also be created by statute. E.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206 (1983).

sufficient basis for holding state law inapplicable to activity undertaken on the res-
ervation or by tribal members.” Id. at 837 (quoting White Mountain, 448 U.S. at
