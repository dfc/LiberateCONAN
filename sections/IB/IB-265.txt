law,1430 and that a state court was without power to proceed with
pending foreclosure proceedings after a farmer-debtor had filed a
petition in federal bankruptcy court for a composition or extension
of time to pay his debts.1431 A state court injunction ordering a de-
fendant to clean up a waste-disposal site was held to be a “liability
on a claim” subject to discharge under the bankruptcy law, after
the state had appointed a receiver to take charge of the defen-
dant’s property and comply with the injunction.1432 A state law gov-
erning fraudulent transfers was found to be compatible with the
federal law.1433
     Substantial disagreement has marked the actions of the Jus-
tices in one area, however, resulting in three five-to-four decisions
first upholding and then voiding state laws providing that a dis-
charge in bankruptcy was not to relieve a judgment arising out of
an automobile accident upon pain of suffering suspension of his driv-
er’s license.1434 The state statutes were all similar enactments of
the Uniform Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, which autho-
rizes the suspension of the license of any driver who fails to satisfy
a judgment against himself growing out of a traffic accident; a sec-
tion of the law specifically provides that a discharge in bankruptcy
will not relieve the debtor of the obligation to pay and the conse-
quence of license suspension for failure to pay. In the first two deci-
sions, the Court majorities decided that the object of the state law
was not to see that such judgments were paid but was rather a
device to protect the public against irresponsible driving.1435 The
last case rejected this view and held that the Act’s sole emphasis
was one of providing leverage for the collection of damages from
