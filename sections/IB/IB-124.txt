minor transactions have an effect on interstate commerce 682 and
that the cumulative effect of many minor transactions with no sepa-
rate effect on interstate commerce, when they are viewed as a class,
may be sufficient to merit congressional regulation.683 “Commerce
among the states must, of necessity, be commerce with[in] the
states. . . . The power of congress, then, whatever it may be, must
be exercised within the territorial jurisdiction of the several states.” 684
    Regulate.— “We are now arrived at the inquiry—what is this
power?” continued the Chief Justice. “It is the power to regulate;
that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.
This power, like all others vested in congress, is complete in itself,
may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limita-
tions, other than are prescribed in the constitution . . . If, as has
always been understood, the sovereignty of congress, though lim-
ited to specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power
over commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states,
is vested in Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single gov-
ernment, having in its constitution the same restrictions on the ex-
ercise of the power as are found in the constitution of the United
States.” 685
    Of course, the power to regulate commerce is the power to pre-
scribe conditions and rules for the carrying-on of commercial trans-
actions, the keeping-free of channels of commerce, the regulating of
prices and terms of sale. Even if the clause granted only this power,
