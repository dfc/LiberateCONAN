merce,667 and that exhibitions of baseball between professional teams
that travel from state to state were not in commerce.668 Similarly,
it held that the Commerce Clause was not applicable to the mak-
ing of contracts for the insertion of advertisements in periodicals in
another state 669 or to the making of contracts for personal services
to be rendered in another state.670
    Later decisions either have overturned or have undermined all
of these holdings. The gathering of news by a press association and
its transmission to client newspapers are interstate commerce.671
The activities of Group Health Association, Inc., which serves only
its own members, are “trade” and capable of becoming interstate
commerce; 672 the business of insurance when transacted between
an insurer and an insured in different states is interstate com-
merce.673 But most important of all there was the development of,

     668 Federal Baseball League v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs,

259 U.S. 200 (1922). When called on to reconsider its decision, the Court declined,
noting that Congress had not seen fit to bring the business under the antitrust laws
by legislation having prospective effect and that the business had developed under
the understanding that it was not subject to these laws, a reversal of which would
have retroactive effect. Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953). In Flood
v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 (1972), the Court recognized these decisions as aberrations,
but it thought the doctrine entitled to the benefits of stare decisis, as Congress was
free to change it at any time. The same considerations not being present, the Court
has held that businesses conducted on a multistate basis, but built around local ex-
hibitions, are in commerce and subject to, inter alia, the antitrust laws, in the in-
