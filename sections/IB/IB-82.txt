Privilege From Arrest
     This clause is practically obsolete. It applies only to arrests in
civil suits, which were still common in this country at the time the
Constitution was adopted.428 It does not apply to service of process
in either civil 429 or criminal cases.430 Nor does it apply to arrest in
any criminal case. The phrase “treason, felony or breach of the peace”
is interpreted to withdraw all criminal offenses from the operation
of the privilege.431

Privilege of Speech or Debate
     Members.—This clause represents “the culmination of a long
struggle for parliamentary supremacy. Behind these simple phrases
lies a history of conflict between the Commons and the Tudor and
Stuart monarchs during which successive monarchs utilized the crimi-
nal and civil law to suppress and intimidate critical legislators. Since
the Glorious Revolution in Britain, and throughout United States
history, the privilege has been recognized as an important protec-
tion of the independence and integrity of the legislature.” 432 So Jus-
tice Harlan explained the significance of the Speech or Debate Clause,
the ancestry of which traces back to a clause in the English Bill of
Rights of 1689 433 and the history of which traces back almost to
the beginning of the development of Parliament as an independent
force.434 “In the American governmental structure the clause serves
the additional function of reinforcing the separation of powers so
deliberately established by the Founders.” 435 “The immunities of the
Speech or Debate Clause were not written into the Constitution sim-
ply for the personal or private benefit of Members of Congress, but
to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the
independence of individual legislators.” 436
   The protection of this clause is not limited to words spoken in
debate. “Committee reports, resolutions, and the act of voting are
equally covered, as are ‘things generally done in a session of the
