ing oil from this region,” 568 the fact that Congress described the
exemption in geographic terms did not condemn the provision.
    The clause accordingly places no obstacle in the way of legisla-
tive classification for the purpose of taxation, nor in the way of what
is called progressive taxation.569 A taxing statute does not fail of
the prescribed uniformity because its operation and incidence may
be affected by differences in state laws.570 A federal estate tax law
that permitted deduction for a like tax paid to a state was not ren-
dered invalid by the fact that one state levied no such tax.571 The
term “United States” in this clause refers only to the states of the
Union, the District of Columbia, and incorporated territories. Con-
gress is not bound by the rule of uniformity in framing tax mea-
sures for unincorporated territories.572 Indeed, in Binns v. United
States,573 the Court sustained license taxes imposed by Congress
but applicable only in Alaska, where the proceeds, although paid
into the general fund of the Treasury, did not in fact equal the to-
tal cost of maintaining the territorial government.

                        PURPOSES OF TAXATION

Regulation by Taxation
    Congress has broad discretion in methods of taxation, and may,
under the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate business within
a state in order to tax it more effectively. For instance, the Court
has sustained regulations regarding the packaging of taxed articles
such as tobacco 574 and oleomargarine,575 which were ostensibly de-
signed to prevent fraud in the collection of the tax. It has also up-
held measures taxing drugs 576 and firearms,577 which prescribed rig-
orous restrictions under which such articles could be sold or
transferred, and imposed heavy penalties upon persons dealing with
them in any other way. These regulations were sustained as condu-
    568  462 U.S. at 85.

     573 194 U.S. 486 (1904). The Court recognized that Alaska was an incorporated

territory but took the position that the situation in substance was the same as if
the taxes had been directly imposed by a territorial legislature for the support of
the local government.
