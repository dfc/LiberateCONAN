general principles which are common to our free institutions, or by
particular provisions of the Constitution of the United States.” 2097
    The protection thus thrown about land grants was presently ex-
tended, in the case of New Jersey v. Wilson,2098 to a grant of immu-
nity from taxation that the State of New Jersey had accorded cer-
tain Indian lands, and several years after that, in Dartmouth
College,2099 to the charter privileges of an eleemosynary corpora-
tion.
    In City of El Paso v. Simmons,2100 the Court held, over a vigor-
ous dissent by Justice Black, that Texas had not violated this clause
when it amended its laws governing the sale of public lands so as
to restrict the previously unlimited right of a delinquent to rein-
state himself upon forfeited land by a single payment of all past
interest due.
     Corporate Charters: Different Ways of Regarding.—There
are three ways in which the charter of a corporation may be re-
garded. In the first place, it may be thought of simply as a license
terminable at will by the state, like a liquor-seller’s license or an
auctioneer’s license, but affording the incorporators, so long as it
remains in force, the privileges and advantages of doing business
in the form of a corporation. Nowadays, indeed, when corporate char-
ters are usually issued to all legally qualified applicants by an ad-
ministrative officer who acts under a general statute, this would
probably seem to be the natural way of regarding them were it not
for the Dartmouth College decision. But, in 1819 charters were granted
directly by the state legislatures in the form of special acts and there
were very few profit-taking corporations in the country. The later
extension of the benefits of the Dartmouth College decision to corpo-
rations organized under general law took place without discussion.
    Secondly, a corporate charter may be regarded as a franchise
constituting a vested or property interest in the hands of the hold-
ers, and therefore as forfeitable only for abuse or in accordance with
its own terms. This is the way in which some of the early state

relied exclusively on general principles. “I do not hesitate to declare, that a State
does not possess the power of revoking its own grants. But I do it, on a general
principle, on the reason and nature of things; a principle which will impose laws
even on the Deity.” Id. at 143.
     2098 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 164 (1812). The exemption from taxation which was involved

in this case was held in 1886 to have lapsed through the acquiescence for sixty years
by the owners of the lands in the imposition of taxes upon these. Given v. Wright,
