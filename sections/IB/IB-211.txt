was void under both the Import-Export Clause 1127 and the Com-
merce Clause. According to the Chief Justice, an inseparable part
of the right to import was the right to sell, and a tax on the sale of
an article is a tax on the article itself. Thus, the taxing power of
the states did not extend in any form to imports from abroad so
long as they remain “the property of the importer, in his ware-
house, in the original form or package” in which they were im-
ported. This is the famous “original package” doctrine. Only when
the importer parts with his importations, mixes them into his gen-
eral property by breaking up the packages, may the state treat them
as taxable property.
    Obviously, to the extent that the Import-Export Clause was con-
strued to impose a complete ban on taxation of imports so long as
they were in their original packages, there was little occasion to
develop a Commerce Clause analysis that would have reached only
discriminatory taxes or taxes upon goods in transit.1128 In other re-
spects, however, the Court has applied the foreign commerce as-
pect of the clause more stringently against state taxation.
    Thus, in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles,1129 the Court
held that, in addition to satisfying the four requirements that gov-
ern the permissibility of state taxation of interstate commerce,1130
“When a State seeks to tax the instrumentalities of foreign com-
merce, two additional considerations . . . come into play. The first
is the enhanced risk of multiple taxation. . . . Second, a state tax
on the instrumentalities of foreign commerce may impair federal
uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential.” 1131 Mul-
tiple taxation is to be avoided with respect to interstate commerce
     1127 Article I, § 10, cl. 2. This aspect of the doctrine of the case was considerably

expanded in Low v. Austin, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 29 (1872), and subsequent cases, to
bar states from levying nondiscriminatory, ad valorem property taxes upon goods
that are no longer in import transit. This line of cases was overruled in Michelin
Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976).
     1128 See, e.g., Halliburton Oil Well Co. v. Reily, 373 U.S. 64 (1963); Minnesota v.

Blasius, 290 U.S. 1 (1933). After the holding in Michelin Tire, the two clauses are
now congruent. The Court has observed that the two clauses are animated by the
same policies. Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434, 449–50 n.14
(1979).
     1129 441 U.S. 434 (1979).
     1130 Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). A state tax

failed to pass the nondiscrimination standard in Kraft General Foods, Inc. v. Iowa
Dept. of Revenue and Finance, 505 U.S. 71 (1992). Iowa imposed an income tax on
a unitary business operating throughout the United States and in several foreign
countries. It taxed the dividends that a corporation received from its foreign subsid-
iaries, but not the dividends it received from its domestic subsidiaries. Therefore,
there was a facial distinction between foreign and domestic commerce.

U.S. 60 (1993) (sustaining state sales tax as applied to lease of containers delivered
within the state and used in foreign commerce).
