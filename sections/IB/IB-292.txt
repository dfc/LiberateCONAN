by the President may therefore be assumed as marking the first of
these dates, and the proclamation that the war had closed, as mark-
ing the second.” 1605
     These cases settled the issue whether a state of war could exist
without formal declaration by Congress. When hostile action is taken
against the Nation, or against its citizens or commerce, the appro-
priate response by order of the President may be resort to force.
But the issue so much a source of controversy in the era of the Cold
War and so divisive politically in the context of United States in-
volvement in the Vietnam War has been whether the President is
empowered to commit troops abroad to further national interests
in the absence of a declaration of war or specific congressional au-
thorization short of such a declaration.1606 The Supreme Court stu-
diously refused to consider the issue in any of the forms in which
it was presented,1607 and the lower courts generally refused, on “po-
litical question” grounds, to adjudicate the matter.1608 In the ab-
sence of judicial elucidation, the Congress and the President have

    1605  The Protector, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 700, 702 (1872).
    1606  The controversy, not susceptible of definitive resolution in any event, was
stilled for the moment, when in 1973 Congress set a cut-off date for United States
military activities in Indochina, Pub. L. 93–52, 108, 87 Stat. 134, and subsequently,
over the President’s veto, Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution, providing a
framework for the assertion of congressional and presidential powers in the use of
military force. Pub. L. 93–148, 87 Stat. 555 (1973), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1541–1548.
     1607 In Atlee v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 911 (1973), aff ’g 347 F. Supp. 689 (E.D.

Pa., 1982), the Court summarily affirmed a three-judge court’s dismissal of a suit
challenging the constitutionality of United States activities in Vietnam on political
question grounds. The action constituted approval on the merits of the dismissal,
but it did not necessarily approve the lower court’s grounds. See also Massachusetts
v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (1970); Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U.S. 1304, 1316, 1321
(1973) (actions of individual justices on motions for stays). The Court simply denied
certiorari in all cases on its discretionary docket.
     1608 E.g., Velvel v. Johnson, 287 F. Supp. 846 (D. Kan. 1968), aff’d sub nom. Velvel

v. Nixon, 415 F.2d 236 (10th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1042 (1970); Luftig v.
McNamara, 252 F. Supp. 819 (D.D.C. 1966), aff’d 373 F.2d 664 (D.C. Cir. 1967), cert.
denied, 389 U.S. 945 (1968); Mora v. McNamara, 387 F.2d 862 (D.C., 1967), cert.
denied, 389 U.S. 934 (1968); Orlando v. Laird, 317 F. Supp. 1013 (E.D.N.Y. 1970),
and Berk v. Laird, 317 F. Supp. 715 (E.D.N.Y. 1970), consolidated and aff’d, 443
F.2d 1039 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 869 (1971); Massachusetts v. Laird,
451 F.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1971); Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 484 F.2d 1307 (2d Cir. 1973),
cert. denied, 416 U.S. 936 (1974); Mitchell v. Laird, 488 F.2d 611 (D.C. Cir. 1973).
     During the 1980s, the courts were no more receptive to suits, many by Mem-
bers of Congress, seeking to obtain a declaration of the President’s powers. The po-
litical question doctrine as well as certain discretionary authorities were relied on.
See, e.g., Crockett v. Reagan, 558 F. Supp. 893 (D.D.C. 1982) (military aid to El Sal-
vador), aff’d, 720 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1251 (1984); Cony-
ers v. Reagan, 578 F. Supp. 324 (D.D.C. 1984) (invasion of Grenada), dismissed as
moot, 765 F.2d 1124 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Lowry v. Reagan, 676 F. Supp. 333 (D.D.C.
1987) (reflagging and military escort operation in Persian Gulf), aff’d. No. 87–5426
(D.C. Cir. 1988); Dellums v. Bush, 752 F. Supp. 1141 (D.D.C. 1990) (U.S. Saudia
Arabia/Persian Gulf deployment).
