     Federal Regulation of Intrastate Rates (The Shreveport Doc-
trine).—Although its statutory jurisdiction did not apply to intra-
state rate systems, the Commission early asserted the right to pass
on rates, which, though in effect on intrastate lines, gave these lines
competitive advantages over interstate lines the rates of which the
Commission had set. This power the Supreme Court upheld in a
case involving a line operating wholly intrastate in Texas but which
paralleled within Texas an interstate line operating between Loui-
siana and Texas; the Texas rate body had fixed the rates of the in-
trastate line substantially lower than the rate fixed by the ICC on
the interstate line. “Wherever the interstate and intrastate transac-
tions of carriers are so related that the government of the one in-
volves the control of the other, it is Congress, and not the State,
that is entitled to prescribe the final and dominant rule, for other-
wise Congress would be denied the exercise of its constitutional au-
thority and the States and not the Nation, would be supreme in
the national field.” 757
     The same holding was applied in a subsequent case in which
the Court upheld the Commission’s action in annulling intrastate
passenger rates it found to be unduly low in comparison with the
rates the Commission had established for interstate travel, thus tend-
ing to thwart, in deference to a local interest, the general purpose
of the act to maintain an efficient transportation service for the ben-
efit of the country at large.758
     Federal Protection of Labor in Interstate Rail Transpor-
tation.—Federal entry into the field of protective labor legislation
and the protection of organization efforts of workers began in con-
nection with the railroads. The Safety Appliance Act of 1893,759 ap-
plying only to cars and locomotives engaged in moving interstate
section construed as prohibiting the hauling of commodities in which the carrier had
at the time of haul a proprietary interest, United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co.,
213 U.S. 366 (1909); a section abrogating life passes, Louisville & Nashville R.R. v.
Mottley, 219 U.S. 467 (1911); a section authorizing the ICC to regulate the entire
bookkeeping system of interstate carriers, including intrastate accounts, ICC v. Goodrich
Transit Co., 224 U.S. 194 (1912); a clause affecting the charging of rates different
for long and short hauls. Intermountain Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 476 (1914).

Colorado v. United States, 271 U.S. 153 (1926), upholding an ICC order directing
abandonment of an intrastate branch of an interstate railroad. But see North Caro-
lina v. United States, 325 U.S. 507 (1945), setting aside an ICC disallowance of in-
trastate rates set by a state commission as unsupported by the evidence and find-
ings.
