lying that decision—that Congress may not lay a tax that would
impair the sovereignty of the states—is still recognized as retain-
ing some vitality.538
    Federal Taxation of State Interests.—In 1903 a succession
tax upon a bequest to a municipality for public purposes was up-
held on the ground that the tax was payable out of the estate be-
fore distribution to the legatee. Looking to form and not to sub-
stance, in disregard of the mandate of Brown v. Maryland,539 a closely
divided Court declined to “regard it as a tax upon the municipality,
though it might operate incidentally to reduce the bequest by the
amount of the tax.” 540 When South Carolina embarked upon the
business of dispensing alcoholic beverages, its agents were held to
be subject to the national internal revenue tax, the ground of the
holding being that in 1787 such a business was not regarded as
one of the ordinary functions of government.541
    Another decision marking a clear departure from the logic of
Collector v. Day was Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,542 in which the Court
sustained an act of Congress taxing the privilege of doing business
as a corporation, the tax being measured by the income. The argu-
ment that the tax imposed an unconstitutional burden on the exer-
cise by a state of its reserved power to create corporate franchises
was rejected, partly because of the principle of national supremacy,
and partly on the ground that the corporate franchises were pri-
vate property. This case also qualified Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &
Trust Co. to the extent that it allowed interest on state bonds to be
included in measuring the tax on the corporation.
    Subsequent cases have sustained an estate tax on the net es-
tate of a decedent, including state bonds,543 excise taxes on the trans-
portation of merchandise in performance of a contract to sell and
deliver it to a county,544 on the importation of scientific apparatus
by a state university,545 on admissions to athletic contests spon-
sored by a state institution, the net proceeds of which were used to
poration of equipment for its police force. Indian Motorcycle v. United States, 283
U.S. 570 (1931). Justices Stone and Brandeis dissented from this decision, and it is
doubtful whether it would be followed today. Cf. Massachusetts v. United States,
435 U.S. 444 (1978).
     538 At least, if the various opinions in New York v. United States, 326 U.S. 572

(1946), retain force, and they may in view of (a later) New York v. United States,
505 U.S. 144 (1992), a Commerce Clause case rather than a tax case.
