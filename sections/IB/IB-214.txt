    Nowadays, state regulation of foreign commerce is likely to be
judged by the extra factors set out in Japan Line.1142 Thus, the ap-
plication of a state civil rights law to a corporation transporting pas-
sengers outside the state to an island in a foreign province was sus-
tained in an opinion emphasizing that, because of the particularistic
geographic situation the foreign commerce involved was more con-
ceptual than actual, there was only a remote hazard of conflict be-
tween state law and the law of the other country and little if any
prospect of burdening foreign commerce.

    CONCURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE JURISDICTION

The General Issue: Preemption
     In Gibbons v. Ogden,1143 the Court, speaking by Chief Justice
Marshall, held that New York legislation that excluded from the navi-
gable waters of that state steam vessels enrolled and licensed un-
der an act of Congress to engage in the coasting trade was in con-
flict with the federal law and hence void.1144 The result, said the
Chief Justice, was required by the Supremacy Clause, which pro-
claims that statutes and treaties as well as the Constitution itself
supersede state laws that “interfere with, or are contrary to” their
dictates. “In every such case, the act of congress, or the treaty, is
supreme; and the law of the state, though enacted in the exercise
of powers not controverted, must yield to it.” 1145

     1142 Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434, 456 n.20 (1979)

(construing Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan, 333 U.S. 28 (1948)).
     1143 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).
     1144 A modern application of Gibbons v. Ogden is Douglas v. Seacoast Products,

Inc., 431 U.S. 265 (1977), in which the Court, relying on the present version of the
licensing statute used by Chief Justice Marshall, struck down state laws curtailing
the operations of federally licensed vessels. In the course of the Douglas opinion,
the Court observed that, “[a]lthough it is true that the Court’s view in Gibbons of
the intent of the Second Congress in passing the Enrollment and Licensing Act is
considered incorrect by commentators, its provisions have been repeatedly re-
enacted in substantially the same form. We can safely assume that Congress was
aware of the holding, as well as the criticism, of a case so renowned as Gibbons. We
have no doubt that Congress has ratified the statutory interpretation of Gibbons
and its progeny.” Id. at 278–79.
     1145 Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 211 (1824). See also McCulloch v.

Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819). Although preemption is basically con-
stitutional in nature, deriving its forcefulness from the Supremacy Clause, it is much
more like statutory decisionmaking, in that it depends upon an interpretation of an
act of Congress in determining whether a state law is ousted. E.g., Douglas v. Sea-
coast Products, Inc., 431 U.S. 265, 271–72 (1977). See also Swift & Co. v. Wickham,
382 U.S. 111 (1965). “Any such pre-emption or conflict claim is of course grounded
in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution: if a state measure conflicts with a
federal requirement, the state provision must give way. The basic question involved
in these cases, however, is never one of interpretation of the Federal Constitution
but inevitably one of comparing two statutes.” Id. at 120.
