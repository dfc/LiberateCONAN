the regulation of aliens and the conduct of foreign affairs, the Court
had little difficulty declaring the entire field to have been occupied
by federal law.1185 Similarly, in Pennsylvania v. Nelson,1186 the Court
invalidated as preempted a state law punishing sedition against the
National Government. The Court enunciated a three-part test: (1)
the pervasiveness of federal regulation, (2) federal occupation of the
field as necessitated by the need for national uniformity, and (3)
the danger of conflict between state and federal administration.1187
    Rice itself held that a federal system of regulating the opera-
tions of warehouses and the rates they charged completely occu-
pied the field and ousted state regulation.1188
    Field preemption analysis often involves delimiting the subject
of federal regulation and determining whether a federal law has
regulated part of the field, however defined, or the whole area, so
that state law cannot even supplement the federal.1189 Illustrative
of this point is the Court’s holding that the Atomic Energy Act’s
preemption of the safety aspects of nuclear power did not invali-
date a state law conditioning construction of nuclear power plants
on a finding by a state agency that adequate storage and disposal
regime of state immigration status checks with federal authorities was found not to
be preempted on its face because the regime was supported by federal law facilitat-
ing federal-state cooperation in immigration enforcement.
     1185 The Court also said that courts must look to see whether under the circum-

stances of a particular case, the state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish-
ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” 312 U.S. at 67.
That standard is obviously drawn from conflict preemption, for the two standards
are frequently intermixed. See AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. ___, No.
09–893, slip op. at 9–18 (2011) (Scalia, J.). Nonetheless, not all state regulation is
precluded. De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351 (1976) (upholding a state law penalizing
the employment of an illegal alien, the case arising before enactment of the federal
law doing the same thing).
     1186 350 U.S. 497 (1956).
     1187 350 U.S. at 502–05. Obviously, there is a noticeable blending into conflict

preemption.
     1188 Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218 (1947).
     1189 See Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp., 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–879,

slip op. (2012) (state suit by the estate of maintenance engineer alleging manufac-
turer’s defective design of locomotive components and failure to warn of accompany-
ing dangers held preempted by the Locomotive Inspection Act; the subject of the Act
held to be the regulation of locomotive equipment generally, including its manufac-
ture, and not limited to regulating activities of locomotive operators or regulating
locomotives while in use for transporation). Compare Campbell v. Hussey, 368 U.S.
297 (1961) (state law requiring tobacco of a certain type to be marked by white tags,
ousted by federal regulation that occupied the field and left no room for supplemen-
tation), with Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132 (1963) (state
law setting minimum oil content for avocados certified as mature by federal regula-
tion is complementary to federal law, because federal standard was a minimum one,
the field having not been occupied). One should be wary of assuming that a state
law that has dual purposes and impacts will not, just for the duality, be held to be
preempted. See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88 (1992); Perez
v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971) (under Bankruptcy Clause).
