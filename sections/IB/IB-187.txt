field, the Court consequently has been unable to rely upon sweep-
ing solutions. To the contrary, its judgments have often been fluctu-
ating and tentative, even contradictory, and this is particularly the
case with respect to the infringement of interstate commerce by the
state taxing power.1003
     Taxation.—The leading case dealing with the relation of the
states’ taxing power to interstate commerce—the case in which the
Court first struck down a state tax as violating the Commerce Clause—
was the State Freight Tax Case.1004 Before the Court was the valid-
ity of a Pennsylvania statute that required every company trans-
porting freight within the state, with certain exceptions, to pay a
tax at specified rates on each ton of freight carried by it. The Court’s
reasoning was forthright. Transportation of freight constitutes com-
merce.1005 A tax upon freight transported from one state to another
effects a regulation of interstate commerce.1006 Under the Cooley doc-
trine, whenever the subject of a regulation of commerce is in its
nature of national interest or admits of one uniform system or plan
of regulation, that subject is within the exclusive regulating con-
trol of Congress.1007 Transportation of passengers or merchandise
through a state, or from one state to another, is of this nature.1008
Hence, a state law imposing a tax upon freight, taken up within
the state and transported out of it or taken up outside the state
and transported into it, violates the Commerce Clause.1009
     The principle thus asserted, that a state may not tax interstate
commerce, confronted the principle that a state may tax all purely
domestic business within its borders and all property “within its
jurisdiction.” Inasmuch as most large concerns prosecute both an
interstate and a domestic business, while the instrumentalities of
interstate commerce and the pecuniary returns from such com-
merce are ordinarily property within the jurisdiction of some state
or other, the task before the Court was to determine where to draw
the line between the immunity claimed by interstate business, on
the one hand, and the prerogatives claimed by local power on the
other. In the State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts Case,1010 decided
the same day as the State Freight Tax Case, the issue was a tax
