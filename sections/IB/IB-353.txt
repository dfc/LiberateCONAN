criminal case is adjudicated, the clause is not implicated, regard-
less of the increase in the burden on a defendant.2045
    Changes in evidentiary rules that allow conviction on less evi-
dence than was required at the time the crime was committed can
also run afoul of the ex post facto clause. This principle was ap-
plied in the Court’s invalidation of retroactive application of a Texas
law that eliminated the requirement that the testimony of a sexual
assault victim age 14 or older must be corroborated by two other
witnesses, and allowed conviction on the victim’s testimony alone.2046

Obligation of Contracts
    “Law” Defined.—The Contract Clause provides that no state
may pass a “Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,” and a “law”
in this context may be a statute, constitutional provision,2047 mu-
nicipal ordinance,2048 or administrative regulation having the force
and operation of a statute.2049 But are judicial decisions within the
clause? The abstract principle of the separation of powers, at least
until recently, forbade the idea that the courts “make” law and the
word “pass” in the above clause seemed to confine it to the formal
and acknowledged methods of exercise of the law-making function.
Accordingly, the Court has frequently said that the clause does not
cover judicial decisions, however erroneous, or whatever their ef-
fect on existing contract rights.2050 Nevertheless, there are impor-
tant exceptions to this rule that are set forth below.
    Status of Judicial Decisions.—Although the highest state court
usually has final authority in determining the construction as well
as the validity of contracts entered into under the laws of the state,
     2045 497 U.S. at 44, 52. Youngblood upheld a Texas statute, as applied to a per-

son committing an offense and tried before passage of the law, that authorized crimi-
nal courts to reform an improper verdict assessing a punishment not authorized by
law, which had the effect of denying defendant a new trial to which he would have
been previously entitled.
