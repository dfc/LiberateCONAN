tion, although this recourse is today seldom, if ever, necessary in
this connection. Some of the more striking cases may be briefly sum-
marized. The provision in the charter of a railway company permit-
ting it to set reasonable charges still left the legislature free to de-
termine what charges were reasonable.2133 However, when a railway
agreed to accept certain rates for a specified period, it thereby fore-
closed the question of the reasonableness of such rates.2134 The grant
to a company of the right to supply a city with water for twenty-
five years was held not to prevent a similar concession to another
company by the same city.2135 The promise by a city in the charter
of a water company not to make a similar grant to any other per-
son or corporation was held not to prevent the city itself from en-
gaging in the business.2136 A municipal concession to a water com-
pany to run for thirty years, and accompanied by the provision that
the “said company shall charge the following rates,” was held not
to prevent the city from reducing such rates.2137 But more broadly,
the grant to a municipality of the power to regulate the charges of
public service companies was held not to bestow the right to con-
tract away this power.2138 Indeed, any claim by a private corpora-
tion that it received the ratemaking power from a municipality must
survive a two-fold challenge: first, as to the right of the municipal-
ity under its charter to make such a grant, secondly, as to whether
it has actually done so, and in both respects an affirmative answer
must be based on express words and not on implication.2139

litical subdivision of a state and private individuals, settled principles of construc-

equivocally expressed.” Justice Black for the Court in Keefe v. Clark, 322 U.S. 393,
