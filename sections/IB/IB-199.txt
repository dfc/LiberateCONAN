ine the in-state business activity which triggers the taxable event
and the practical or economic effect of the tax on that interstate
activity.” 1067
    In Goldberg v. Sweet, the Court upheld as properly apportioned
a state tax on the gross charge of any telephone call originated or
terminated in the state and charged to an in-state service address,
regardless of where the telephone call was billed or paid.1068 A com-
plex state tax imposed on trucks displays the operation of the test.
Thus, a state registration tax met the internal consistency test be-
cause every state honored every other states’, and a motor fuel tax
similarly was sustained because it was apportioned to mileage trav-
eled in the state, whereas lump-sum annual taxes, an axle tax and
an identification marker fee, being unapportioned flat taxes im-
posed for the use of the state’s roads, were voided, under the inter-
nal consistency test, because if every state imposed them, then the
burden on interstate commerce would be great.1069
    Deference to state taxing authority was evident in a case in which
the Court sustained a state sales tax on the price of a bus ticket
for travel that originated in the state but terminated in another
state. The tax was unapportioned to reflect the intrastate travel and
the interstate travel.1070 The tax in this case was different from the
tax upheld in Central Greyhound, the Court held. The previous tax
constituted a levy on gross receipts, payable by the seller, whereas
the present tax was a sales tax, also assessed on gross receipts, but
payable by the buyer. The Oklahoma tax, the Court continued, was
internally consistent, because if every state imposed a tax on ticket
sales within the state for travel originating there, no sale would be
subject to more than one tax. The tax was also externally consis-
tent, the Court held, because it was a tax on the sale of a service
that took place in the state, not a tax on the travel.1071

    1068  488 U.S. 252 (1989). The tax law provided a credit for any taxpayer who
was taxed by another state on the same call. Actual multiple taxation could thus be
avoided, the risks of other multiple taxation was small, and it was impracticable to
keep track of the taxable transactions.
     1069 American Trucking Ass’ns v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266 (1987).
     1070 Indeed, there seemed to be a precedent squarely on point: Central Grey-

hound Lines v. Mealey, 334 U.S. 653 (1948). The Court in that case struck down a
state statute that failed to apportion its taxation of interstate bus ticket sales to
reflect the distance traveled within the state.
     1071 Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175 (1995). In-

deed, the Court analogized the tax to that in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252 (1989),
a tax on interstate telephone services that originated in or terminated in the state
and that were billed to an in-state address.
