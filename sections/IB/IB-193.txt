own inspectors with 24 hours of slaughter. Thus, meat slaughtered
in other states was excluded from the Minnesota market. The prin-
ciple of the case has a long pedigree of application.1040 State protec-
tionist regulation on behalf of local milk producers has occasioned
judicial censure. Thus, in Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig.,1041 the Court
had before it a complex state price-fixing scheme for milk, in which
the state, in order to keep the price of milk artificially high within
the state, required milk dealers buying out-of-state to pay produc-
ers, wherever they were, what the dealers had to pay within the
state, and, thus, in-state producers were protected. And, in H. P.
Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond,1042 the Court struck down a state
refusal to grant an out-of-state milk distributor a license to operate
a milk receiving station within the state on the basis that the addi-
tional diversion of local milk to the other state would impair the
supply for the in-state market. A state may not bar an interstate
market to protect local interests.1043

State Taxation and Regulation: The Modern Law
    General Considerations.—Transition from the old law to the
modern standard occurred relatively smoothly in the field of regu-
lation,1044 but in the area of taxation the passage was choppy and



      1040 E.g., Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U.S. 78 (1891) (law requiring postslaughter

inspection in each county of meat transported over 100 miles from the place of slaugh-
ter); Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 340 U.S. 349 (1951) (city ordinance prevent-
ing selling of milk as pasteurized unless it had been processed and bottled at an
approved plant within a radius of five miles from the central square of Madison). As
the latter case demonstrates, it is constitutionally irrelevant that other Wisconsin
producers were also disadvantaged by the law. For a modern application of the prin-
ciple of these cases, see Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan Nat. Res. Dep’t,
504 U.S. 353 (1992) (forbidding landfills from accepting out-of-county wastes). See
also C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383, 391 (1994) (discrimi-
nation against interstate commerce not preserved because local businesses also suf-
fer).
      1041 294 U.S. 511 (1935). See also Polar Ice Cream & Creamery Co. v. Andrews,

375 U.S. 361 (1964). With regard to products originating within the state, the Court
had no difficulty with price fixing. Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934).
      1042 336 U.S. 525 (1949). For the most recent case in this saga, see West Lynn

Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186 (1994).
      1043 And the Court does not permit a state to combat discrimination against its

own products by admitting only products (here, again, milk) from states that have
reciprocity agreements with it to protect its own dealers. Great Atlantic & Pacific
Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366 (1976).
      1044 Formulation of a balancing test was achieved in Southern Pacific Co. v. Ari-

zona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945), and was thereafter maintained more or less consistently.
The Court’s current phrasing of the test was in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S.
137 (1970).
