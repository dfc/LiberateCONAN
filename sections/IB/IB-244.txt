citizen of the United States.1287 But power to naturalize aliens un-
der federal standards may be, and was early, devolved by Congress
upon state courts of record.1288 And though the states may not pre-
scribe requirements for citizenship, they may confer rights, includ-
ing political rights, to resident aliens. At one time, it was not un-
common for states to confer the right of suffrage upon resident aliens,
especially upon those who had declared their intention to become
citizens, and several states continued to do so until well into the
twentieth century.1289
     Citizenship by naturalization is a privilege to be given or with-
held as Congress may determine: “It is not within the province of
the courts to make bargains with those who seek naturalization.
They must accept the grant and take the oath in accordance with
the terms fixed by the law, or forego the privilege of citizenship.
There is no middle choice.” 1290 This interpretation makes of the natu-
ralization power the only power granted in § 8 of Article I that is
unrestrained by constitutional limitations on its exercise. Thus, the
first naturalization act enacted by the first Congress restricted natu-
ralization to “free white person[s],” 1291 which was expanded in 1870
so that persons of “African nativity and . . . descent” were entitled
to be naturalized.1292 “Chinese laborers” were specifically excluded
from eligibility in 1882,1293 and the courts enforced these provi-

United States, 149 U.S. 698, 707–08 (1893). Though Congress broadly controls the
path to naturalization in the United States, it is restricted in conditioning the reten-
tion of citizenship so conferred. The Fourteenth Amendment declares persons born
or naturalized in the United States to be citizens, and Congress may not distin-
guish among classes of “Fourteenth Amendment” citizens in setting rules for expa-
triation (assuming the absence of fraud in obtaining naturalization). Schneider v.
Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964). By contrast, Congress controls by statute who born abroad
becomes a U.S. citizen at birth (based generally on the citizenship status of the par-
ents), at times has conditioned this “statutory” citizenship on subsequent periodic
residence in the United States, and has had relinquishment of citizenship for fail-
ure to meet this condition subsequent upheld by the Court. Rogers v. Bellei, 401
