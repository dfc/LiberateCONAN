ally to strike down a state law solely 964 on Commerce Clause grounds
was the State Freight Tax Case.965 The question before the Court
was the validity of a nondiscriminatory statute that required every
company transporting freight within the state, with certain excep-
tions, to pay a tax at specified rates on each ton of freight carried.
Opining that a tax upon freight, or any other article of commerce,
transported from state to state is a regulation of commerce among
the states and, further, that the transportation of merchandise or
passengers through a state or from state to state was a subject that
required uniform regulation, the Court held the tax in issue to be
repugnant to the Commerce Clause.
    Whether exclusive or partially exclusive, however, the Com-
merce Clause as a restraint upon state exercises of power, absent
congressional action, received no sustained justification or explana-
tion; the clause, of course, empowers Congress, not the courts, to
regulate commerce among the states. Often, as in Cooley and in later
cases, the Court stated or implied that the rule was imposed by
the Commerce Clause.966 In Welton v. Missouri,967 the Court at-
tempted to suggest a somewhat different justification. The case in-
volved a challenge to a state statute that required a “peddler’s” li-
cense for merchants selling goods that came from other states, but
that required no license if the goods were produced in the state.
Declaring that uniformity of commercial regulation is necessary to
     964 Just a few years earlier, the Court, in an opinion that merged Commerce

Clause and Import-Export Clause analyses, had seemed to suggest that it was a
discriminatory tax or law that violates the Commerce Clause and not simply a tax
on interstate commerce. Woodruff v. Parham, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 123 (1869).
     965 Reading R.R. v. Pennsylvania, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873). For cases in

which the Commerce Clause basis was intermixed with other express or implied pow-
ers, see Crandall v. Nevada, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35 (1868); Steamship Co. v. Portwardens,
73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 31 (1867); Woodruff v. Parham, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 123 (1868). Chief
Justice Marshall, in Brown v. Maryland, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419, 488–89 (1827),
indicated, in dicta, that a state tax might violate the Commerce Clause.
     966 “Where the subject matter requires a uniform system as between the States,

the power controlling it is vested exclusively in Congress, and cannot be encroached
upon by the States.” Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100, 108–09 (1890). The Commerce
Clause “remains in the Constitution as a grant of power to Congress . . . and as a
diminution pro tanto of absolute state sovereignty over the same subject matter.”
Carter v. Virginia, 321 U.S. 131, 137 (1944). The Commerce Clause, the Court has
said, “does not say what the states may or may not do in the absence of congressio-
nal action, nor how to draw the line between what is and what is not commerce
among the states. Perhaps even more than by interpretation of its written word,
this Court has advanced the solidarity and prosperity of this Nation by the mean-
ing it has given these great silences of the Constitution.” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v.
Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 534–35 (1949). Subsequently, the Court stated that the Com-
merce Clause “has long been recognized as a self-executing limitation on the power
of the States to enact laws imposing substantial burdens on such commerce.’ ” Den-
nis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 447 (1991) (quoting South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v.
Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 87 (1984) (emphasis added)).
