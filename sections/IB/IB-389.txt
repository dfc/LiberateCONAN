       it held that a state law forbidding the importation of intoxicating
       liquors into the state could not be sustained as an inspection law.2229

    Clause 3. No State shall, without the Consent of Congress,
lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time
of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State,
or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually in-
vaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.

                                     TONNAGE DUTIES
            The purpose of the Tonnage Clause is “to ‘restrai[n] the states
       themselves from the exercise’ of the taxing power ‘injuriously to the
       interests of each other.’ . . . In writing the Tonnage Clause, the Fram-
       ers recognized that, if ‘the states had been left free to tax the privi-
       lege of access by vessels to their harbors the prohibition [in Article
       I, § 10, clause 2] against duties on imports and exports could have
       been nullified by taxing the vessels transporting the merchan-
       dise.’ ” 2230 The prohibition against tonnage duties embraces all taxes
       and duties, regardless of their name or form, whether measured by
       the tonnage of the vessel or not, that, in effect, are charges for the
       privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port.2231 The Tonnage
       Clause, however, does not ban all “taxes which fall on vessels that
       use a State’s port, harbor, or other waterways. Such a radical propo-
       sition would transform the Tonnage Clause from one that protects
       vessels, and their owners, from discrimination by seaboard States,
       to one that gives vessels preferential treatment vis-à-vis all other
       property, and its owners, in a seaboard State.” 2232 But it does not
       extend to charges made by state authority, even if graduated accord-
