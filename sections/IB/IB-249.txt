spects the individual.” 1318 A similar idea was expressed in Knauer
v. United States.1319 “Citizenship obtained through naturalization
is not a second-class citizenship. . . . [It] carries with it the privi-
lege of full participation in the affairs of our society, including the
right to speak freely, to criticize officials and administrators, and to
promote changes in our laws including the very Charter of our Gov-
ernment.”
    Despite these dicta, it is clear that particularly in the past but
currently as well a naturalized citizen has been and is subject to
requirements not imposed on native-born citizens. Thus, as we have
noted above, a naturalized citizen is subject at any time to have
his good faith in taking the oath of allegiance to the United States
inquired into and to lose his citizenship if lack of such faith is shown
in proper proceedings.1320 And the naturalized citizen within a year
of his naturalization will join a questionable organization at his
peril.1321 In Luria v. United States,1322 the Court sustained a stat-
ute making prima facie evidence of bad faith a naturalized citizen’s
assumption of residence in a foreign country within five years after
the issuance of a certificate of naturalization. But in Schneider v.
Rusk,1323 the Court voided a statute that provided that a natural-
ized citizen should lose his United States citizenship if following
naturalization he resided continuously for three years in his for-
mer homeland. “We start,” Justice Douglas wrote for the Court, “from
the premise that the rights of citizenship of the native-born and of
the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are coextensive.
The only difference drawn by the Constitution is that only the ‘natu-

One must be aware, however, that this language does not appear in any case hav-
ing to do with citizenship or naturalization or the rights of naturalized citizens and
its force may be therefore questioned. Compare Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 261
(1967) (Justice Black for the Court: “a mature and well-considered dictum . . . ”),
with id. at 275–76 (Justice Harlan dissenting: the dictum, “cannot have been in-
tended to reach the question of citizenship”). The issue in Osborn was the right of
the Bank to sue in federal court. Osborn had argued that the fact that the bank
was chartered under the laws of the United States did not make any legal issue
involving the bank one arising under the laws of the United States for jurisdictional
purposes; to argue the contrary, Osborn contended, was like suggesting that the fact
that persons were naturalized under the laws of Congress meant such persons had
an automatic right to sue in federal courts, unlike natural-born citizens. The quoted
language of Marshall’s rejects this attempted analogy.
