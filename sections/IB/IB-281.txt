monopolistic privileges that are forbidden by those acts are en-
tirely consistent in their holdings.1537
     Congress has the power to pass copyright laws that, in its po-
litical judgment, will serve the ends of the Copyright Clause. Con-
gress may “promote the Progress of Science” (i.e., the creation and
dissemination of knowledge and learning) not only by providing in-
centives for new works, but also by conferring copyright protection
to works in the public domain.1538 The Copyright Clause also broadly
empowers Congress to extend the terms of existing copyrights, so
long as the extended terms are for determinable periods.1539

Copyright and the First Amendment
     The Copyright Clause nominally restricts free speech by allow-
ing for an author’s monopoly to market his original work. The Court
has “recognized that some restriction on expression is the inherent
and intended effect of every grant of copyright.” 1540 However, that
the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment were adopted close
in time reflects the Framers’ belief that “copyright’s limited monopo-
lies are compatible with free speech principles.” 1541 “[T]he Framers
intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression. By es-
tablishing a marketable right to the use of one’s expression, copy-
right supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate
ideas.” 1542
    The Court has noted on several occasions that the copyright law
contains two important First Amendment safeguards: (1) limiting
copyright protection to an author’s creative expression of ideas, but
prohibiting protection of ideas in and of themselves; and (2) permit-
ting fair use of a copyrighted work in certain circumstances, includ-
ing for purposes of criticism, teaching, comment, news reporting,
and parody. These traditional contours of copyright protection have
foreclosed heightened First Amendmebnt scrutiny of copyright laws.1543
