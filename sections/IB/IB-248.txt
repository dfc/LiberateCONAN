fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom
or which the petitioner was before a subject or citizen; (3) to sup-
port and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and
allegiance to the same; and (5) (A) to bear arms on behalf of the
United States when required by the law, or (B) to perform noncom-
batant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when re-
quired by the law, or (C) to perform work of national importance
under civilian direction when required by law.” 1315
     Any naturalized person who takes this oath with mental reser-
vations or conceals or misrepresents beliefs, affiliations, and con-
duct, which under the law disqualify one for naturalization, is sub-
ject, upon these facts being shown in a proceeding brought for the
purpose, to have his certificate of naturalization cancelled.1316 More-
over, if within a year of his naturalization a person joins an organi-
zation or becomes in any way affiliated with one which was a dis-
qualification for naturalization if he had been a member at the time,
the fact is made prima facie evidence of his bad faith in taking the
oath and grounds for instituting proceedings to revoke his admis-
sion to citizenship.1317

Rights of Naturalized Persons
    Chief Justice Marshall early stated in dictum that “[a] natural-
ized citizen . . . becomes a member of the society, possessing all the
rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the Constitu-
tion, on the footing of a native. The Constitution does not autho-
rize Congress to enlarge or abridge those rights. The simple power
of the national legislature is, to prescribe a uniform rule of natural-
ization, and the exercise of this power exhausts it, so far as re-
    1315 § 337(a), 66 Stat. 258 (1952), 8 U.S.C. § 1448(a). In United States v. Schwim-

mer, 279 U.S. 644 (1929), and United States v. MacIntosh, 283 U.S. 605 (1931), a
divided Court held that clauses (3) and (4) of the oath, as then prescribed, required
the candidate for naturalization to be willing to bear arms for the United States,
thus disqualifying conscientious objectors. These cases were overturned, purely as a
matter of statutory interpretation by Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61 (1946),
and Congress codified the result, 64 Stat. 1017 (1950), as it now appears in the cited
statute.
    1316 § 340(a), 66 Stat. 260 (1952), 8 U.S.C. § 1451(a). See Kungys v. United States,

485 U.S. 759 (1988) (badly fractured Court opinion dealing with the statutory re-
quirements in a denaturalization proceeding under this section). See also Johannes-
sen v. United States, 225 U.S. 227 (1912). Congress has imposed no time bar appli-
cable to proceedings to revoke citizenship, so that many years after naturalization
has taken place a naturalized citizen remains subject to divestment upon proof of
fraud. Costello v. United States, 365 U.S. 265 (1961); Polites v. United States, 364
U.S. 426 (1960); Knauer v. United States, 328 U.S. 654 (1946); Fedorenko v. United
States, 449 U.S. 490 (1981).
    1317 340(c), 66 Stat. 261 (1952), 8 U.S.C. § 1451(c). The time period had previ-

ously been five years.
