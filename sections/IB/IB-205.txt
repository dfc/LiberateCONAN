Further extending the application of the negative commerce clause
to waste disposal,1096 the Court, in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of
Clarkstown,1097 invalidated as discriminating against interstate com-
merce a local “flow control” ordinance that required all solid waste
within the town to be processed at a designated transfer station
before leaving the municipality. Underlying the restriction was the
town’s decision to have a solid waste transfer station built by a pri-
vate contractor, rather than with public funds. To make the arrange-
ment appealing to the contractor, the town guaranteed it a mini-
mum waste flow, which the town ensured by requiring that all solid
waste generated within the town be processed at the contractor’s
station.
     The Court saw the ordinance as a form of economic protection-
ism, in that it “hoard[ed] solid waste, and the demand to get rid of
it, for the benefit of the preferred processing facility.” 1098 The Court
found that the town could not “justify the flow control ordinance as
a way to steer solid waste away from out-of-town disposal sites that
it might deem harmful to the environment. To do so would extend
the town’s police power beyond its jurisdictional bounds. States and
localities may not attach restrictions to exports or imports in order
to control commerce in other states.” 1099 The Court also found that
the town’s goal of “revenue generation is not a local interest that
can justify discrimination against interstate commerce. Otherwise
States could impose discriminatory taxes against solid waste origi-
nating outside the State.” 1100 Moreover, the town had other means
to raise revenue, such as subsidizing the facility through general
taxes or municipal bonds.1101 The Court did not deal with—indeed,
did not notice—the fact that the local law conferred a governmen-
