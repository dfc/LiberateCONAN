protecting others bespoke no intention that federally unprotected
materials should enjoy no state protection, only that Congress “has
left the area unattended.” 1549 Similar analysis was used to sustain
the application of a state trade secret law to protect a chemical pro-
cess, that was patentable but not patented, from use by a commer-
cial rival, which had obtained the process from former employees
of the company, all of whom had signed agreements not to reveal
the process. The Court determined that protection of the process
by state law was not incompatible with the federal patent policy of
encouraging invention and public use of patented inventions, inas-
much as the trade secret law serves other interests not similarly
served by the patent law and where it protects matter clearly pat-
entable it is not likely to deter applications for patents.1550
    Returning to the Sears and Compco emphasis, the Court unani-
mously, in Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,1551 reas-
serted that “efficient operation of the federal patent system de-
pends upon substantially free trade in publicly known, unpatented
design and utilitarian conceptions.” 1552 At the same time, however,
the Court attempted to harmonize Goldstein, Kewanee, and other
decisions: there is room for state regulation of the use of unpatented
designs if those regulations are “necessary to promote goals out-
side the contemplation of the federal patent scheme.” 1553 What states
are forbidden to do is to “offer patent-like protection to intellectual
creations which would otherwise remain unprotected as a matter
of federal law.” 1554 A state law “aimed directly at preventing the
exploitation of the [unpatented] design” is invalid as impinging on
an area of pervasive federal regulation.1555

     1549 In the 1976 revision of the copyright law, Congress broadly preempted, with

narrow exceptions, all state laws bearing on material subject to copyright. 17 U.S.C.
§ 301. The legislative history makes clear Congress’s intention to overturn Goldstein
and “to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of a state
that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works coming within the scope
of the federal copyright law.” H. REP. NO. 94–1476, 94th Congress, 2d Sess. (1976),
130. The statute preserves state tape piracy and similar laws as to sound record-
ings fixed before February 15, 1972, until February 15, 2067. (Pub. L. 105–298 (1998),
§ 102, extended this date from February 15, 2047.)

the Court referred to unfair competition, trademark, trade dress, and trade secrets
laws. Perhaps by way of distinguishing Sears and Compco, both of which invali-
dated use of unfair competition laws, the Court suggested that prevention of “con-
sumer confusion” is a permissible state goal that can be served in some instances
by application of such laws. Id. at 154.
