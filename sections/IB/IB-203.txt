that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the
local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well
with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” 1087
    Obviously, the test requires “evenhanded[ness].” Discrimina-
tion in regulation is another matter altogether. When on its face or
in its effect a regulation betrays “economic protectionism”—an in-
tent to benefit in-state economic interests at the expense of out-of-
state interests—then no balancing is required. “When a state stat-
ute clearly discriminates against interstate commerce, it will be struck
down . . . unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a
valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism, . . . . Indeed, when
the state statute amounts to simple economic protectionism, a ‘vir-
tually per se rule of invalidity’ has applied.” 1088 Thus, an Okla-
homa law that required coal-fired electric utilities in the state, pro-
ducing power for sale in the state, to burn a mixture of coal containing
at least 10% Oklahoma-mined coal was invalidated at the behest
of a state that had previously provided virtually 100% of the coal
used by the Oklahoma utilities.1089 Similarly, the Court invalidated
a state law that permitted interdiction of export of hydroelectric power
from the state to neighboring states, when in the opinion of regula-
tory authorities the energy was required for use in the state; a state
may not prefer its own citizens over out-of-state residents in access
to resources within the state.1090
    States may certainly promote local economic interests and fa-
vor local consumers, but they may not do so by adversely regulat-
ing out-of-state producers or consumers. In Hunt v. Washington State

    1087  397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970) (citation omitted).
    1088  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 454 (1992) (quoting City of Philadel-
phia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 624 (1978)). See also Brown-Forman Distillers
Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573, 579 (1986). In Maine v. Taylor,
477 U.S. 131 (1986), the Court upheld a protectionist law, finding a valid justifica-
tion aside from economic protectionism. The state barred the importation of out-of-
state baitfish, and the Court credited lower-court findings that legitimate ecological
concerns existed about the possible presence of parasites and nonnative species in
baitfish shipments.
     1089 Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437 (1992). See also Maryland v. Louisi-

ana, 451 U.S. 725 (1981) (a tax case, invalidating a state first-use tax, which, be-
cause of exceptions and credits, imposed a tax only on natural gas moving out-of-
state, because of impermissible discrimination).
     1090 New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331 (1982). See also

Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 (1979) (voiding a ban on transporting minnows
caught in the state for sale outside the state); Sporhase v. Nebraska, 458 U.S. 941
(1982) (invalidating a ban on the withdrawal of ground water from any well in the
state intended for use in another state). These cases largely eviscerated a line of
older cases recognizing a strong state interest in protection of animals and re-
sources. See Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519 (1896). New England Power had rather
old antecedents. E.g., West v. Kansas Gas Co., 221 U.S. 229 (1911); Pennsylvania v.
West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553 (1923).
