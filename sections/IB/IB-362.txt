tence, as specious as any that can be alleged on this occasion, will
never be wanting on any future occasion. Those acts of the state,
which have hitherto been considered as the sure anchors of privi-
lege and of property, will become the sport of every varying gust of
politicks, and will float wildly backwards and forwards on the ir-
regular and impetuous tides of party and faction.” 2091
    Furthermore, in its first important constitutional case, Chisholm
v. Georgia,2092 the Court ruled that its original jurisdiction ex-
tended to an action in assumpsit brought by a citizen of South Caro-
lina against the State of Georgia. This construction of the federal
judicial power was, to be sure, promptly repealed by the Eleventh
Amendment, but without affecting the implication that the con-
tracts protected by the Constitution included public contracts.
     One important source of this diversity of opinion is to be found
in that ever welling spring of constitutional doctrine in early days,
the prevalence of natural law notions and the resulting vague sig-
nificance of the term “law.” In Sturges v. Crowninshield, Chief Jus-
tice Marshall defined the obligation of contract as the law that binds
a party “to perform his undertaking.” 2093 Whence, however, comes
this law? If it comes from the state alone, which Marshall was later
to deny even as to private contracts,2094 then it is hardly possible
to hold that the states’ own contracts are covered by the clause,
which manifestly does not create an obligation for contracts but only
protects such obligation as already exists. But, if, on the other hand,
the law furnishing the obligation of contracts comprises natural law
and kindred principles, as well as law that springs from state au-
thority, then, as the state itself is presumably bound by such prin-
ciples, the state’s own obligations, so far as harmonious with them,
are covered by the clause.
    Fletcher v. Peck 2095 has the double claim to fame that it was
the first case in which the Supreme Court held a state enactment
to be in conflict with the Constitution, and also the first case to
hold that the Contract Clause protected public grants. By an act
passed on January 7, 1795, the Georgia Legislature directed the sale
to four land companies of public lands comprising most of what are
now the States of Alabama and Mississippi. As soon became known,
the passage of the measure had been secured by open and whole-
