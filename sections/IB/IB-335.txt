sis.1912 “A court must ascertain whether the legislature intended the
statute to establish civil proceedings. A court will reject the legisla-
ture’s manifest intent only where a party challenging the Act pro-
vides the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in
either purpose or effect as to negate the State’s intention.” 1913 A
statute that has been held to be civil and not criminal in nature
cannot be deemed punitive “as applied” to a single individual.1914
    A variety of federal laws have been challenged as ex post facto.
A statute that prescribed as a qualification for practice before the
federal courts an oath that the attorney had not participated in the
Rebellion was found unconstitutional because it operated as a pun-
ishment for past acts.1915 But a statute that denied to polygamists
the right to vote in a territorial election was upheld even as ap-
plied to one who had not contracted a polygamous marriage and
had not cohabited with more than one woman since the act was
passed, because the law did not operate as an additional penalty
for the offense of polygamy but merely defined it as a disqualifica-
tion of a voter.1916 A deportation law authorizing the Secretary of
Labor to expel aliens for criminal acts committed before its pas-
sage is not ex post facto because deportation is not a punish-
ment.1917 For this reason, a statute terminating payment of old-age
benefits to an alien deported for Communist affiliation also is not
ex post facto, for the denial of a non-contractual benefit to a de-
ported alien is not a penalty but a regulation designed to relieve
the Social Security System of administrative problems of supervi-
sion and enforcement likely to arise from disbursements to benefi-
ciaries residing abroad.1918 Likewise, an act permitting the cancel-
lation of naturalization certificates obtained by fraud prior to the

Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302 (1955). Justices Black and Douglas, reiterating in
Lehman v. United States ex rel. Carson, 353 U.S. 685, 690–91 (1957), their dissent
from the premise that the ex post facto clause is directed solely to penal legislation,
disapproved a holding that an immigration law, enacted in 1952, 8 U.S.C. § 1251,
which authorized deportation of an alien who, in 1945, had acquired a status of
nondeportability under pre-existing law is valid. In their opinion, to banish, in 1957,
an alien who had lived in the United States for almost 40 years, for an offense com-
mitted in 1936, and for which he already had served a term in prison, was to retro-
spectively subject him to a new punishment.
