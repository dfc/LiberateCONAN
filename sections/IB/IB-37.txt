phasized the importance of administrative procedures in upholding
broad delegations to administrative agencies,171 it has not, since
Schechter and Carter Coal, relied on the distinction to strike down
a private delegation.

Particular Subjects or Concerns—Closer Scrutiny or
   Uniform Standard?
     The Court has strongly implied that the same principles gov-
ern the validity of a delegation regardless of the subject matter of
the delegation. “[A] constitutional power implies a power of delega-
tion of authority under it sufficient to effect its purposes.” 172 Hold-
ing that “the delegation of discretionary authority under Con-
gress’s taxing power is subject to no constitutional scrutiny greater
than that we have applied to other nondelegation challenges,” the
Court explained in Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Company 173 that
there was “nothing in the placement of the Taxing Clause” in Ar-
ticle I, § 8 that would distinguish it, for purposes of delegation, from
the other powers enumerated in that clause.174 Thus, the test in
the taxing area is the same as for other areas—whether the stat-
ute has provided the administrative agency with standards to guide
its actions in such a way that a court can determine whether the
congressional policy has been followed.
     This does not mean that Congress may delegate its power to
determine whether taxes should be imposed. What was upheld in
Skinner was delegation of authority to the Secretary of Transporta-
tion to collect “pipeline safety user fees” for users of natural gas
and hazardous liquid pipelines. “Multiple restrictions” placed on the
Secretary’s discretion left no doubt that the constitutional require-
ment of an intelligible standard had been met. Cases involving the
    171 See, e.g., Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 424–25 (1944).
    172 Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 778–79 (1948).
    173 490 U.S. 212, 223 (1989). In National Cable Television Ass’n v. United States,

415 U.S. 336, 342 (1974), and FPC v. New England Power Co., 415 U.S. 345 (1974),
the Court had appeared to suggest that delegation of the taxing power would be
fraught with constitutional difficulties. It is difficult to discern how this view could
have been held after the many cases sustaining delegations to fix tariff rates, which
are in fact and in law taxes. J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S.
394 (1928); Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892); see also FEA v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.,
426 U.S. 548 (1976) (delegation to President to raise license “fees” on imports when
necessary to protect national security). Nor should doubt exist respecting the appro-
priations power. See Synar v. United States, 626 F. Supp. 1374, 1385–86 (D.D.C.)
(three-judge court), aff’d on other grounds sub nom. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714
(1986).
    174 490 U.S. at 221. Nor is there basis for distinguishing the other powers enu-

merated in § 8. See, e.g., Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748 (1996). But see Touby
v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 166 (1991) (it is “unclear” whether a higher stan-
dard applies to delegations of authority to issue regulations that contemplate crimi-
nal sanctions), discussed in the next section.
