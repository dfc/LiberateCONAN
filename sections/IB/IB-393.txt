of the crime problem, the problem of highway safety, the trailer prob-
lem, problems created by social security legislation, and the fram-
ing of uniform state legislation for dealing with some of these.2255

Consent of Congress
     The Constitution makes no provision with regard to the time
when the consent of Congress shall be given or the mode or form
by which it shall be signified.2256 While the consent will usually pre-
cede the compact or agreement, it may be given subsequently where
the agreement relates to a matter which could not be well consid-
ered until its nature is fully developed.2257 The required consent is
not necessarily an expressed consent; it may be inferred from cir-
cumstances.2258 It is sufficiently indicated, when not necessary to
be made in advance, by the approval of proceedings taken under
it.2259 The consent of Congress may be granted conditionally “upon
terms appropriate to the subject and transgressing no constitu-
tional limitations.” 2260 Congress does not, by giving its consent to a
compact, relinquish or restrict its own powers, as for example, its
power to regulate interstate commerce.2261

Grants of Franchise to Corporations by Two States
    It is competent for a railroad corporation organized under the
laws of one state, when authorized so to do by the consent of the
state that created it, to accept authority from another state to ex-
tend its railroad into such state and to receive a grant of powers to
own and control, by lease or purchase, railroads therein and to sub-
ject itself to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the second state. Such legislation on the part of two or more states
is not, in the absence of inhibitory legislation by Congress, re-
garded as within the constitutional prohibition of agreements or com-
pacts between states.2262
