cial decisions for over a century,1510 “novelty and utility” has been
the primary statutory test since the Patent Act of 1793.1511 Section
103 of the Patent Act of 1952, however, required that an innova-
tion be of a “nonobvious” nature; that is, it must not be an improve-
ment that would be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in
the pertinent art.1512 This alteration of the standard of patentabil-
ity was perceived by some as overruling previous Supreme Court
cases requiring perhaps a higher standard for obtaining a pat-
ent,1513 but, in Graham v. John Deere Co.,1514 the Court inter-
preted the provision as having codified its earlier holding in Hotchkiss
v. Greenwood.1515 The Court in Graham said: “Innovation, advance-
ment, and things which add to the sum of useful knowledge are
inherent requisites in a patent system which by constitutional com-
mand must ‘promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts.’ This is the
standard expressed in the Constitution and it may not be ig-
nored.” 1516 Congressional requirements on patentability, then, are
conditions and tests that must fall within the constitutional stan-
dard. Underlying the constitutional tests and congressional condi-
tions for patentability is the balancing of two interests—the inter-
est of the public in being protected against monopolies and in having
ready access to and use of new items versus the interest of the coun-
try, as a whole, in encouraging invention by rewarding creative per-
sons for their innovations. By declaring a constitutional standard

     The opinion concludes: “The attempts through the years to get a broader, looser
conception of patents than the Constitution contemplates have been persistent. The
Patent Office, like most administrative agencies, has looked with favor on the oppor-
tunity which the exercise of discretion affords to expand its own jurisdiction. And so
it has placed a host of gadgets under the armour of patents—gadgets that obviously
have had no place in the constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge. A
few that have reached this Court show the pressure to extend monopoly to the sim-
plest of devices: [listing instances].” Id. at 156–58.
