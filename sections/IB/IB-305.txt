same category as the power to levy and collect taxes, duties, and
excises. It belongs to the war powers of the Government. . . .” 1698
    Both theories found expression in different passages of Chief Jus-
tice Stone’s opinion in Hirabayashi v. United States,1699 upholding
executive imposition of a curfew on Japanese-Americans pursuant
to legislative delegation. On the one hand, he spoke to Congress
and the Executive, “acting in cooperation,” to impose the cur-
few,1700 while, on the other hand, he noted that a delegation in which
Congress has determined the policy and the rule of conduct, leav-
ing to the Executive the carrying-out of the policy, is permissible
delegation.1701
    A similar ambiguity is found in Lichter v. United States,1702 up-
holding the Renegotiation Act, but taken as a whole the Court there
espoused the second theory. “The power [of delegation] is especially
significant in connection with constitutional war powers under which
the exercise of broad discretion as to methods to be employed may
be essential to an effective use of its war powers by Congress. The
degree to which Congress must specify its policies and standards
in order that the administrative authority granted may not be an
unconstitutional delegation of its own legislative power is not ca-
pable of precise definition. . . . Thus, while the constitutional struc-
ture and controls of our Government are our guides equally in war
and in peace, they must be read with the realistic purposes of the
entire instrument fully in mind.” 1703 The Court then examined the
exigencies of war and concluded that the delegation was valid.1704

Constitution and the Advance of the Flag
    Theater of Military Operations.—Military law to the exclu-
sion of constitutional limitations otherwise applicable is the rule in
the areas in which military operations are taking place. This view
was assumed by all members of the Court in Ex parte Milligan,1705
in which the trial by a military commission of a civilian charged
with disloyalty in a part of the country remote from the theater of
military operations was held invalid. Although unanimous in the
result, the Court divided five-to-four on the ground of decision. The
