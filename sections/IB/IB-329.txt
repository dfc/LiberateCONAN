ture” the suspending power,1870 but the author of this proposal did
not retain this language when the matter was taken up,1871 the pres-
ent language then being adopted.1872 Nevertheless, Congress’s power
to suspend was assumed in early commentary 1873 and stated in dic-
tum by the Court.1874 President Lincoln suspended the privilege on
his own motion in the early Civil War period,1875 but this met with
such opposition 1876 that he sought and received congressional au-
thorization.1877 Three other suspensions were subsequently ordered
on the basis of more or less express authorizations from Con-
gress.1878
    When suspension operates, what is suspended? In Ex parte Mil-
ligan,1879 the Court asserted that the Writ is not suspended but only
the privilege, so that the Writ would issue and the issuing court on
its return would determine whether the person applying can pro-
ceed, thereby passing on the constitutionality of the suspension and
whether the petitioner is within the terms of the suspension.
    Restrictions on habeas corpus placed in the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immi-
gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) have pro-
vided occasion for further analysis of the scope of the Suspension
Clause. AEDPA’s restrictions on successive petitions from state pris-
oners are “well within the compass” of an evolving body of prin-
ciples restraining “abuse of the writ,” and hence do not amount to
a suspension of the writ within the meaning of the Clause.1880 In-
