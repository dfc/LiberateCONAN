tions by non-Indians, which was already taxed by the tribe,1268 the
impairment of tribal sovereignty was “too indirect and too insub-
stantial” to warrant a finding of preemption. The fact that the state
provided significant services to the oil and gas lessees justified state
taxation and also distinguished earlier cases in which the state had
“asserted no legitimate regulatory interest that might justify the
tax.” 1269 Still further erosion, or relaxation, of the principle of con-
struction may be found in a later case, in which the Court, con-
fronted with arguments that the imposition of particular state taxes
on Indian property on the reservation was inconsistent with self-
determination and self-governance, denominated these as “policy”
arguments properly presented to Congress rather than the Court.1270
    The impact on tribal sovereignty is also a prime determinant of
relative state and tribal regulatory authority.1271
    Since Worcester v. Georgia,1272 the Court has recognized that In-
dian tribes are unique aggregations possessing attributes of sover-
eignty over both their members and their territory.1273 They are, of
course, no longer possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty,1274
having relinquished some part of it by their incorporation within
the territory of the United States and their acceptance of its protec-

     1270 County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes & Bands of the Yakima Indian Na-

tion, 502 U.S. 251, 265 (1992). To be sure, this response was in the context of the
reading of statutory texts and giving effect to them, but the unqualified designation
is suggestive. For recent tax controversies, see Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Sac & Fox
Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993); Department of Taxation & Finance v. Milhelm Attea &
Bros., 512 U.S. 61 (1994); Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S.
450 (1995).

     1272 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832). See also Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5

Pet.) 1 (1831). Under this doctrine, tribes possess sovereign immunity from suit in
the same way that the United States and the states do. Santa Clara Pueblo v. Mar-
tinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58 (1978); United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty
Co., 309 U.S. 506, 512–13 (1940). The Court has repeatedly rejected arguments to
abolish tribal sovereign immunity or at least to curtail it. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.
Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. 505, 510 (1991).
     1273 United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313 (1978) (inherent sovereign power to

punish tribal offenders). Compare California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,
480 U.S. 202 (1987) (state regulation of on-reservation bingo is preempted as basi-
cally civil/regulatory rather than criminal/prohibitory), with Brendale v. Confeder-
ated Tribes & Bands of the Yakima Indian Nation, 492 U.S. 408 (1989) (extensive
ownership of land within “open areas” of reservation by non-members of tribe pre-
cludes application of tribal zoning within such areas). See also Hagen v. Utah, 510
U.S. 399 (1994). Among the fundamental attributes of sovereignty which a tribe pos-
sesses unless divested of it by federal law is the power to tax non-Indians entering
the reservation to engage in economic activities. Washington v. Confederated Colville
Tribes, 447 U.S. 134 (1980); Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982).
