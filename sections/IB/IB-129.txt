Ogden,706 where the waters of the State of New York in their qual-
ity as highways of interstate and foreign transportation were held
to be governed by the overriding power of Congress. Likewise, the
same opinion recognizes that in “the progress of things,” new and
other instruments of commerce will make their appearance. When
the Licensing Act of 1793 was passed, the only craft to which it
could apply were sailing vessels, but it and the power by which it
was enacted were, Marshall asserted, indifferent to the “principle”
by which vessels were moved. Its provisions therefore reached steam
vessels as well. A little over half a century later the principle em-
bodied in this holding was given its classic expression in the opin-
ion of Chief Justice Waite in the case of the Pensacola Telegraph
Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.,707 a case closely paralleling Gib-
bons v. Ogden in other respects also. “The powers thus granted are
not confined to the instrumentalities of commerce, or the postal ser-
vice known or in use when the Constitution was adopted, but they
keep pace with the progress of the country, and adapt themselves
to the new developments of times and circumstances. They extend
from the horse with its rider to the stage-coach, from the sailing-
vessel to the steamboat, from the coach and the steamboat to the
railroad, and from the railroad to the telegraph, as these new agen-
cies are successively brought into use to meet the demands of in-
creasing population and wealth. They were intended for the govern-
ment of the business to which they relate, at all times and under
all circumstances. As they were intrusted to the general govern-
ment for the good of the nation, it is not only the right, but the
duty, of Congress to see to it that intercourse among the States and
the transmission of intelligence are not obstructed or unnecessarily
encumbered by State legislation.” 708
