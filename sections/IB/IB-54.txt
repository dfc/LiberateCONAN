poenas as well as to search warrants.264 But there are no cases in
which a holding turns on this issue.265
    Other constitutional rights of witnesses have been asserted at
various times, but without success or even substantial minority sup-
port.

Sanctions of the Investigatory Power: Contempt
    Explicit judicial recognition of the right of either house of Con-
gress to commit for contempt a witness who ignores its summons
or refuses to answer its inquiries dates from McGrain v. Daugherty.266
But the principle there applied had its roots in an early case, An-
derson v. Dunn,267 which stated in broad terms the right of either
branch of the legislature to attach and punish a person other than
a member for contempt of its authority.268 The right to punish a
contumacious witness was conceded in Marshall v. Gordon,269 al-
though the Court there held that the implied power to deal with
contempt did not extend to the arrest of a person who published
matter defamatory of the House.
    The cases emphasize that the power to punish for contempt rests
upon the right of self-preservation. That is, in the words of Chief
Justice White, “the right to prevent acts which in and of them-
selves inherently obstruct or prevent the discharge of legislative duty
or the refusal to do that which there is inherent legislative power
to compel in order that legislative functions may be performed” ne-
cessitates the contempt power. 270 Thus, in Jurney v. Mac-
Cracken,271 the Court turned aside an argument that the Senate
had no power to punish a witness who, having been commanded to
produce papers, destroyed them after service of the subpoena. The
punishment would not be efficacious in obtaining the papers in this
particular case, but the power to punish for a past contempt is an

cited.

     267 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 204 (1821).
     268 The contempt consisted of an alleged attempt to bribe a Member of the House

for his assistance in passing a claims bill. The case was a civil suit brought by An-
derson against the Sergeant at Arms of the House for assault and battery and false
imprisonment. Cf. Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168 (1881). The power of a legis-
lative body to punish for contempt one who disrupts legislative business was reaf-
firmed in Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U.S. 496 (1972), but a unanimous Court there held
that due process required a legislative body to give a contemnor notice and an op-
portunity to be heard prior to conviction and sentencing. Although this case dealt
with a state legislature, there is no question it would apply to Congress as well.
