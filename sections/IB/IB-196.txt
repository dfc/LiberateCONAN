fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the
state—that is, whether the state has given anything for which it
can ask return.” 1055
    The question of the presence of a substantial nexus often arises
when a state imposes on out-of-state vendors an obligation to col-
lect use taxes on goods sold in the taxing state, and a determina-
tive factor is whether the vendor is physically present in the state.
The Court has sustained such an imposition on mail order sellers
with retail outlets, solicitors, or property within the taxing state,1056
but it has denied the power to a state to tax a seller whose “only
connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or the
United States mail.” 1057 The validity of general business taxes on
interstate enterprises may also be determined by the nexus stan-
dard. However, again, only a minimal contact is necessary.1058 Thus,
maintenance of one full-time employee within the state (plus occa-
sional visits by non-resident engineers) to make possible the real-
ization and continuance of contractual relations seemed to the Court
to make almost frivolous a claim of lack of sufficient nexus.1059 The

     1055 128 S. Ct. at 1505 (internal quotation marks omitted). It had been thought,

prior to the decision in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota ex rel. Heitkamp, 504 U.S. 298,
305 (1992), that the tests for nexus under the Commerce Clause and the Due Pro-
cess Clause were identical, but the Court in that case, although stating that the
two tests “are closely related” (citing National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue
of Illinois, 386 U.S. 753, 756 (1967)), held that they “differ fundamentally” and found
a state tax to satisfy the Due Process Clause but to violate the Commerce Clause.
Compare Quill at 325–28 (Justice White concurring in part and dissenting in part).
However, the requirement for “some definite link, some minimum connection, be-
tween a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax” probably sur-
vives the bifurcation of the tests in Quill. National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dept. of Rev-
enue of Illinois, 386 U.S. 753, 756 (1967) (Commerce Clause), quoting Miller Bros.
Co. v. Maryland, 347 U.S. 340, 344–45 (1954) (Due Process Clause).

nia Bd. of Equalization, 430 U.S. 551 (1977). In Scripto, the vendor’s agents that
were in the state imposing the tax were independent contractors, rather than em-
ployees, but this distinction was irrelevant. See also Tyler Pipe Indus. v. Washing-
ton State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 249–50 (1987) (reaffirming Scripto on this
point). See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U.S. 24 (1988) (upholding im-

poration and shipped to prospective customers within the state).
