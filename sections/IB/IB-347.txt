the bank, be payable in exchange drafts, was held valid.2002

Bills of Attainder
     Statutes passed after the Civil War with the intent and result
of excluding persons who had aided the Confederacy from following
certain callings, by the device of requiring them to take an oath
that they had never given such aid, were held invalid as being bills
of attainder, as well as ex post facto laws.2003
     Other attempts to raise bill-of-attainder claims have been un-
successful. A Court majority denied that a municipal ordinance that
required all employees to execute oaths that they had never been
affiliated with Communist or similar organizations, violated the clause,
on the grounds that the ordinance merely provided standards of quali-
fications and eligibility for employment.2004 A law that prohibited
any person convicted of a felony and not subsequently pardoned from
holding office in a waterfront union was not a bill of attainder be-
cause the “distinguishing feature of a bill of attainder is the substi-
tution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt” and the
prohibition “embodies no further implications of appellant’s guilt than
are contained in his 1920 judicial conviction.” 2005

Ex Post Facto Laws
    Scope of the Provision.—The prohibition against state ex post
facto laws, like the cognate restriction imposed on the Federal Gov-
ernment by § 9, relates only to penal and criminal legislation and
not to civil laws that affect private rights adversely.2006 Distinguish-
ing between civil and penal laws was at the heart of the Court’s
decision in Smith v. Doe 2007 upholding application of Alaska’s “Me-
gan’s Law” to sex offenders who were convicted before the law’s en-
