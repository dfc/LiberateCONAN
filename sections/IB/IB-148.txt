    In A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,802 one of
these codes, the Live Poultry Code, was pronounced unconstitu-
tional. Although it was conceded that practically all poultry handled
by the Schechters came from outside the State, and hence via inter-
state commerce, the Court held, nevertheless, that once the chick-
ens came to rest in the Schechter’s wholesale market, interstate com-
merce in them ceased. The act, however, also purported to govern
business activities which “affected” interstate commerce. This, Chief
Justice Hughes held, must be taken to mean “directly” affect such
commerce: “the distinction between direct and indirect effects of in-
trastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized
as a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitu-
tional system. Otherwise, . . . there would be virtually no limit to
the federal power and for all practical purposes we should have a
completely centralized government.” 803 In short, the case was gov-
erned by the ideology of the Sugar Trust case, which was not men-
tioned in the Court’s opinion.804
    Agricultural Adjustment Act.—Congress’s second attempt to
combat the Depression was the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933.805
As is pointed out elsewhere, the measure was set aside as an at-
tempt to regulate production, a subject held to be “prohibited” to
the United States by the Tenth Amendment.806
    Bituminous Coal Conservation Act.—The third measure to
be disallowed was the Guffey-Snyder Bituminous Coal Conserva-
tion Act of 1935.807 The statute created machinery for the regula-
tion of the price of soft coal, both that sold in interstate commerce

     804 In United States v. Sullivan, 332 U.S. 689 (1948), the Court interpreted the

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 as applying to the sale by a retailer
of drugs purchased from his wholesaler within the State nine months after their
interstate shipment had been completed. The Court, speaking by Justice Black, cited
United States v. Walsh, 331 U.S. 432 (1947); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942);
United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U.S. 110 (1942); United States v. Darby,
312 U.S. 100 (1941). Justice Frankfurter dissented on the basis of FTC v. Bunte
Bros., 312 U.S. 349 (1941). It is apparent that the Schechter case has been thor-
oughly repudiated so far as the distinction between “direct” and “indirect” effects is
concerned. Cf. Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971). See also McDermott v.
Wisconsin, 228 U.S. 115 (1913), which preceded Schechter by more than two de-
cades.
     The NIRA, however, was found to have several other constitutional infirmities
besides its disregard, as illustrated by the Live Poultry Code, of the “fundamental”
distinction between “direct” and “indirect” effects, namely, the delegation of standard-
less legislative power, the absence of any administrative procedural safeguards, the
absence of judicial review, and the dominant role played by private groups in the
general scheme of regulation.
