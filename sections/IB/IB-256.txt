     Except for the Alien Act of 1798,1356 Congress went almost a
century without enacting laws regulating immigration into the United
States. The first such statute, in 1875, barred convicts and prosti-
tutes 1357 and was followed by a series of exclusions based on health,
criminal, moral, economic, and subversion considerations.1358 An-
other important phase was begun with passage of the Chinese Ex-
clusion Act in 1882,1359 which was not repealed until 1943.1360 In
1924, Congress enacted into law a national origins quota formula
which based the proportion of admittable aliens on the nationality
breakdown of the 1920 census, which, of course, was heavily weighed
in favor of English and northern European ancestry.1361 This na-
tional origins quota system was in effect until it was repealed in
1965.1362 The basic law remains the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1952,1363 which retains its essential structure while undergo-
ing several significant revisions. These revisions have included a
temporary legalization program for certain unauthorized aliens, em-
ployer sanctions, a general expansion and tightening of rules for
removal, changes in categories of aliens who may enter temporar-
ily, and more express provisions on federal-state cooperation in im-
migration enforcement.
    Numerous cases underscore the sweeping nature of the powers
of the Federal Government to exclude aliens and to deport aliens
by administrative process. For example, in United States ex rel. Knauff

ally intended to serve that interest. The case struck down a classification that the
Court thought justified by the interest asserted but that had not been imposed by a
body charged with effectuating that interest. See Vergara v. Hampton, 581 F.2d 1281
(7th Cir. 1978). See Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 509 U.S. 155 (1993) (construing
statutes and treaty provisions restrictively to affirm presidential power to interdict
and seize fleeing aliens on high seas to prevent them from entering U.S. waters).
