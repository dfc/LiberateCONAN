one else could infringe, especially in view of the fact that VCRs are
capable of substantial noninfringing “fair use,” e.g., time-shifting of
television viewing.
    Congress was within its powers in giving to authors the exclu-
sive right to dramatize any of their works. Even as applied to pan-
tomime dramatization by means of silent motion pictures, the act
was sustained against the objection that it extended the copyright
to ideas rather than to the words in which they were clothed.1530
But the copyright of the description of an art in a book was held
not to lay a foundation for an exclusive claim to the art itself. The
latter can be protected, if at all, only by letters patent.1531 Because
copyright is a species of property distinct from the ownership of the
equipment used in making copies of the matter copyrighted, the sale
of a copperplate under execution did not pass any right to print
and publish the map which the copperplate was designed to pro-
duce.1532 A patent right may, however, be subjected, by bill in eq-
uity, to payment of a judgment debt of the patentee.1533

Power of Congress Over Patents and Copyrights
    Letters patent for a new invention or discovery in the arts con-
fer upon the patentee an exclusive property in the patented inven-
tion that cannot be appropriated or used by the government with-
out just compensation.1534 Congress may, however, modify rights under
an existing patent, provided vested property rights are not thereby
impaired,1535 but it does not follow that it may authorize an inven-
tor to recall rights that he has granted to others or reinvest in him
rights of property that he had previously conveyed for a valuable
and fair consideration.1536 Furthermore, the rights the present stat-
utes confer are subject to the antitrust laws, though it can hardly
be said that the cases in which the Court has endeavored to draw
the line between the rights claimable by patentees and the kind of
