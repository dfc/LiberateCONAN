forbid action altogether by any power or combination of powers in

    Thus, it is now well-established that “[w]hen Congress so chooses,
state actions which it plainly authorizes are invulnerable to consti-
tutional attack under the Commerce Clause.” 997 But the Court re-
quires congressional intent to permit otherwise impermissible state
actions to “be unmistakably clear.” 998 The fact that federal statutes
and regulations had restricted commerce in timber harvested from
national forest lands in Alaska was, therefore, “insufficient indi-
cium” that Congress intended to authorize the state to apply a simi-
lar policy for timber harvested from state lands. The rule requiring
clear congressional approval for state burdens on commerce was said
to be necessary in order to strengthen the likelihood that decisions
favoring one section of the country over another are in fact “collec-
tive decisions” made by Congress rather than unilateral choices im-
posed on unrepresented out-of-state interests by individual states.999
     996 328 U.S. at 434–35. The Act restored state taxing and regulatory powers over

the insurance business to their scope prior to South-Eastern Underwriters. Discrimi-
natory state taxation otherwise cognizable under the Commerce Clause must, there-
fore, be challenged under other provisions of the Constitution. See Western & South-
ern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 451 U.S. 648 (1981). An equal protection
challenge was successful in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U.S. 869 (1985),
invalidating a discriminatory tax and stating that a favoring of local industries “con-
stitutes the very sort of parochial discrimination that the Equal Protection Clause
was intended to prevent.” Id. at 878. In Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Gover-
nors of the Federal Reserve System, 472 U.S. 159, 176–78 (1985), the Court de-
clined to follow Ward where state statutes did not, as in Ward, favor local corpora-
tions at the expense of out-of-state corporations, but instead “favor[ed] out-of-state
corporations domiciled within the New England region over out-of-state corpora-
tions from other parts of the country.” The Court noted that the statutes in North-
east Bancorp were concerned with “preserv[ing] a close relationship between those
in the community who need credit and those who provide credit,” and with protect-
ing “the independence of local banking institutions”; they did not, like the statutes
in Ward, discriminate against “nonresident corporations solely because they were
nonresidents.”
     997 Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-

tem, 472 U.S. 159, 174 (1985) (interpreting a provision of the Bank Holding Com-
pany Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1842(d), permitting regional interstate bank acquisitions ex-
pressly approved by the state in which the acquired bank is located, as authorizing
state laws that allow only banks within the particular region to acquire an in-state
bank, on a reciprocal basis, since what the states could do entirely they can do in
part).

thorization of state laws regulating milk solids does not authorize milk pricing and
pooling laws). Earlier cases had required express statutory sanction of state bur-
dens on commerce but under circumstances arguably less suggestive of congressio-
nal approval. E.g., Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 958–60 (1982)
(congressional deference to state water law in 37 statutes and numerous interstate
compacts did not indicate congressional sanction for invalid state laws imposing a
burden on commerce); New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 331,
