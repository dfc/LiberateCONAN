be presented to the President of the United States; If he ap-
proves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his
Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and pro-
ceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of
that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, to-
gether with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall
likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that
House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes
of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the
Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be
entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill
shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sun-
days excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the
Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, un-
less the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return in
which Case it shall not be a Law.
    Clause 3. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Con-
currence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be nec-
essary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented
to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall
take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by
him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House
of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitation pre-
scribed in the Case of a Bill.
