legislation enacted under the Commerce Clause only if it is clear
that there is no rational basis for a congressional finding that the
regulated activity affects interstate commerce, or that there is no
reasonable connection between the regulatory means selected and
the asserted ends.” 894 Moreover, “[t]he pertinent inquiry therefore
is not how much commerce is involved but whether Congress could
rationally conclude that the regulated activity affects interstate com-
merce.” 895
    In a companion case, the Court reiterated that “[t]he denomina-
tion of an activity as a ‘local’ or ‘intrastate’ activity does not resolve
the question whether Congress may regulate it under the Com-
merce Clause. As previously noted, the commerce power ‘extends to
those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce, or
the exertion of the power of Congress over it, as to make regula-
tion of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate
end, the effective execution of the granted power to regulate inter-
state commerce.’ ” 896 Judicial review is narrow. Congress’s determi-
nation of an “effect” must be deferred to if it is rational, and Con-
gress must have acted reasonably in choosing the means.897
    Fourth, a still more potent engine of regulation has been the
expansion of the class-of-activities standard, which began in the “af-
fecting” cases. In Perez v. United States,898 the Court sustained the
application of a federal “loan-sharking” law to a local culprit. The
Court held that, although individual loan-sharking activities might
be intrastate in nature, still it was within Congress’s power to de-
termine that the activity was within a class the activities of which
did affect interstate commerce, thus affording Congress the oppor-
tunity to regulate the entire class. Although the Perez Court and
the congressional findings emphasized that loan-sharking was gen-
erally part of organized crime operating on a national scale and that
loan-sharking was commonly used to finance organized crime’s na-
tional operations, subsequent cases do not depend upon a defen-
sible assumption of relatedness in the class.

494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990). Then-Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the two Hodel cases,
objected that the Court was making it appear that no constitutional limits existed
under the Commerce Clause, whereas in fact it was necessary that a regulated ac-
tivity must have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, not just some effect.
He thought it a close case that the statutory provisions here met those tests. 452
