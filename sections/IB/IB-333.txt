cordings accumulated during the tenure of former President Nixon,1899
the Court set out a rather different formula for deciding bill of at-
tainder cases.1900 The law specifically applied only to President Nixon
and directed an executive agency to assume control over the mate-
rials and prepare regulations providing for ultimate public dissemi-
nation of at least some of them; the act assumed that it did not
deprive the former President of property rights but authorized the
award of just compensation if it should be judicially determined that
there was a taking. First, the Court denied that the clause denies
the power to Congress to burden some persons or groups while not
so treating all other plausible individuals or groups; even the pres-
ent law’s specificity in referring to the former President by name
and applying only to him did not condemn the act because he “con-
stituted a legitimate class of one” on whom Congress could “fairly
and rationally” focus.1901 Second, even if the statute’s specificity did
bring it within the prohibition of the clause, the lodging of Mr. Nixon’s
materials with the GSA did not inflict punishment within the mean-
ing of the clause. This analysis was a three-pronged one: 1) the law
imposed no punishment traditionally judged to be prohibited by the
clause; 2) the law, viewed functionally in terms of the type and se-
verity of burdens imposed, could rationally be said to further nonpuni-
tive legislative purposes; and 3) the law had no legislative record
evincing a congressional intent to punish.1902 That is, the Court,
looking “to its terms, to the intent expressed by Members of Con-
gress who voted its passage, and to the existence or nonexistence
of legitimate explanations for its apparent effect,” concluded that
the statute served to further legitimate policies of preserving the
availability of evidence for criminal trials and the functioning of the
adversary legal system and in promoting the preservation of re-
cords of historical value, all in a way that did not and was not in-
tended to punish the former President.

nerable to nonjudicial determinations of guilt and does not apply

Justice Stevens’ concurrence is more specifically directed to the facts behind the stat-
ute than is the opinion of the Court, id. at 484, and Justice White, author of the
dissent in Brown, merely noted he found the act nonpunitive. Id. at 487. Chief Jus-
tice Burger and Justice Rehnquist dissented. Id. at 504, 536–45. Adding to the im-
pression of a departure from Brown is the quotation in the opinion of the Court at
several points of the Brown dissent, id. at 470 n.31, 471 n.34, while the dissent quoted
and relied on the opinion of the Court in Brown. Id. at 538, 542.
