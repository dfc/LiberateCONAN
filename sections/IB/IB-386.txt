mands with respect to imports and their taxation,” are compre-
hended by the terms “imports” and “exports.” 2203 With respect to
exports, the exemption from taxation “attaches to the export and
not to the article before its exportation,” 2204 requiring an essen-
tially factual inquiry into whether there have been acts of move-
ment toward a final destination constituting sufficient entrance into
the export stream as to invoke the protection of the clause.2205 To
determine how long imported wares remain under the protection of
this clause, the Supreme Court enunciated the original package doc-
trine in the leading case of Brown v. Maryland. “When the im-
porter has so acted upon the thing imported,” wrote Chief Justice
Marshall, “that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the
mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive
character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power
of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in
his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was im-
ported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports, to escape the
prohibition in the Constitution.” 2206 A box, case, or bale in which
separate parcels of goods have been placed by the foreign seller is
regarded as the original package, and upon the opening of such con-
tainer for the purpose of using the separate parcels, or of exposing
them for sale, each loses its character as an import and becomes
subject to taxation as a part of the general mass of property in the
state.2207 Imports for manufacture cease to be such when the in-
tended processing takes place,2208 or when the original packages are
broken.2209 Where a manufacturer imports merchandise and stores
it in his warehouse in the original packages, that merchandise does
not lose its quality as an import, at least so long as it is not re-
quired to meet such immediate needs.2210 The purchaser of im-
ported goods is deemed to be the importer if he was the efficient
