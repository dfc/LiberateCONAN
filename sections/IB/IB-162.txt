tion it is for Congress to determine what legislation will attain its
purpose. The control of Congress over interstate commerce is not
to be limited by State laws.” 873
     In Brooks v. United States,874 the Court sustained the National
Motor Vehicle Theft Act 875 as a measure protective of owners of au-
tomobiles; that is, of interests in “the State of origin.” The statute
was designed to repress automobile motor thefts, notwithstanding
that such thefts antedate the interstate transportation of the ar-
ticle stolen. Speaking for the Court, Chief Justice Taft, at the out-
set, stated the general proposition that “Congress can certainly regu-
late interstate commerce to the extent of forbidding and punishing
the use of such commerce as an agency to promote immorality, dis-
honesty, or the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other
States from the State of origin.” Noting “the radical change in trans-
portation” brought about by the automobile, and the rise of “[e]labo-
rately organized conspiracies for the theft of automobiles . . . and
their sale or other disposition” in another jurisdiction from the own-
er’s, the Court concluded that such activity “is a gross misuse of
interstate commerce. Congress may properly punish such inter-
state transportation by anyone with knowledge of the theft, be-
cause of its harmful result and its defeat of the property rights of
those whose machines against their will are taken into other juris-
dictions.” The fact that stolen vehicles were “harmless” and did not
spread harm to persons in other states on this occasion was not
deemed to present any obstacle to the exercise of the regulatory power
of Congress.876
     The Darby Case.—In sustaining the Fair Labor Standards Act 877
in 1941,878 the Court expressly overruled Hammer v. Dagenhart.879
“The distinction on which the [latter case] . . . was rested that Con-
gressional power to prohibit interstate commerce is limited to ar-
ticles which in themselves have some harmful or deleterious prop-
erty—a distinction which was novel when made and unsupported
by any provision of the Constitution—has long since been aban-
doned. . . . The thesis of the opinion that the motive of the prohibi-
tion or its effect to control in some measure the use or production
within the States of the article thus excluded from the commerce
can operate to deprive the regulation of its constitutional authority
