selves and to become naturalized United States citizens.1336 An 1865
law provided for the forfeiture of the “rights of citizenship” of draft-
dodgers and deserters, but whether the statute meant to deprive
such persons of citizenship or of their civil rights is unclear.1337 Be-
ginning in 1940, however, Congress did enact laws designed to strip
of their citizenship persons who committed treason,1338 deserted the
armed forces in wartime,1339 left the country to evade the draft,1340
or attempted to overthrow the government by force or violence.1341
In 1907, Congress provided that female citizens who married for-
eign citizens were to have their citizenship held “in abeyance” while
they remained wedded but to be entitled to reclaim it when the mar-
riage was dissolved.1342
    About the simplest form of expatriation, the renunciation of citi-
zenship by a person, there is no constitutional difficulty. “Expatria-
tion is the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of nationality
and allegiance.” 1343 But while the Court has hitherto insisted on
the voluntary character of the renunciation, it has sustained the
power of Congress to prescribe conditions and circumstances the vol-
untary entering into of which constitutes renunciation; the person
need not intend to renounce so long as he intended to do what he
did in fact do.1344
    The Court first encountered the constitutional issue of forced
expatriation in the rather anomalous form of the statute,1345 which
placed in limbo the citizenship of any American female who mar-
ried a foreigner. Sustaining the statute, the Court relied on the con-
gressional foreign relations power exercised in order to prevent the
     1336 Act of July 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 223. While the Act’s preamble rhetorically

proclaims the “natural and inherent right of all people” to expatriate themselves, its
title is “An Act concerning the Rights of American Citizens in foreign States” and
its operative parts are concerned with that subject. It has long been taken, however,
as a general proclamation of United States recognition of the right of United States
citizens to expatriate themselves. Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 309 (1915); Mandoli
v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133, 135–36 (1952). Cf. Savorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S.
491, 498 n.11 (1950).
     1337 The Enrollment Act of March 3, 1865, § 21, 13 Stat. 487, 490. The language

of the section appears more consistent with a deprivation of civil rights than of citi-
zenship. Note also that § 14 of the Wade-Davis Bill, pocket-vetoed by President Lin-
coln, specifically provided that any person holding office in the Confederate Govern-
ment “is hereby declared not to be a citizen of the United States.” 6 J. RICHARDSON,
