tent under the Articles of Confederation, would thereby be brought
to an end. As Webster stated in his argument for appellant in Gib-
bons v. Ogden: “The prevailing motive was to regulate commerce;
to rescue it from the embarrassing and destructive consequences,
resulting from the legislation of so many different States, and to
place it under the protection of a uniform law.” 953 In other words,
the constitutional grant was itself a regulation of commerce in the
interest of uniformity.954
    That the Commerce Clause, unimplemented by congressional leg-
islation, took from the states any and all power over foreign and
interstate commerce was by no means conceded and was, indeed,
counterintuitive, considering the extent of state regulation that ex-
isted before the Constitution.955 Moreover, legislation by Congress
that regulated any particular phase of commerce would raise the
question whether the states were entitled to fill the remaining gaps,
if not by virtue of a “concurrent” power over interstate and foreign
commerce, then by virtue of “that immense mass of legislation” as
Marshall termed it, “which embraces everything within the terri-
tory of a State, not surrendered to the general government” 956—in
a word, the “police power.”
    The text and drafting record of the Commerce Clause fails, there-
fore to settle the question of what power is left to the states to adopt
legislation regulating foreign or interstate commerce in greater or

     953 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 11 (1824). Justice Johnson’s assertion, concurring, was

to the same effect. Id. at 226. Late in life, James Madison stated that the power
had been granted Congress mainly as “a negative and preventive provision against
injustice among the States.” 4 LETTERS AND OTHER WRITINGS OF JAMES MADISON 14–15
(1865).
     954 It was evident from THE FEDERALIST that the principal aim of the Commerce

Clause was the protection of the national market from the oppressive power of indi-
vidual States acting to stifle or curb commerce. Id. at No. 7, 39–41 (Hamilton); No.
11, 65–73 (Hamilton); No. 22, 135–137 (Hamilton); No. 42, 283–284 (Madison); No.
53, 362–364 (Madison). See H. P. Hood & Sons v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 533 (1949).
For a comprehensive history of the adoption of the Commerce Clause, which does
not indicate a definitive answer to the question posed, see Abel, The Commerce Clause
in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 MINN. L. REV.
432 (1941). Professor Abel discovered only nine references in the Convention re-
cords to the Commerce Clause, all directed to the dangers of interstate rivalry and
retaliation. Id. at 470–71 & nn. 169–75.
     955 The strongest suggestion of exclusivity found in the Convention debates is a

remark by Madison. “Whether the States are now restrained from laying tonnage
duties depends on the extent of the power ‘to regulate commerce.’ These terms are
vague but seem to exclude this power of the States.” 2 M. FARRAND, THE RECORDS OF
THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787 625 (rev. ed. 1937). However, the statement is re-
corded during debate on the clause, Art. I, § 10, cl. 3, prohibiting states from laying
tonnage duties. That the Convention adopted this clause, when tonnage duties would
certainly be one facet of regulating interstate and foreign commerce, casts doubt on
the assumption that the commerce power itself was intended to be exclusive.
