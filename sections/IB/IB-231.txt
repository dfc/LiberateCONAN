vides further and additional support for the pre-emption claim. Nor
need we consider the applicability of field pre-emption.” 1212
     Similarly, the Court found it unnecessary to consider field pre-
emption due to its holding that a Massachusetts law barring state
agencies from purchasing goods or services from companies doing
business with Burma imposed obstacles to the accomplishment of
Congress’s full objectives under the federal Burma sanctions law.1213
The state law was said to undermine the federal law in several re-
spects that could have implicated field preemption—by limiting the
President’s effective discretion to control sanctions, and by frustrat-
ing the President’s ability to engage in effective diplomacy in devel-
oping a comprehensive multilateral strategy—but the Court “de-
cline[d] to speak to field preemption as a separate issue.” 1214
     Also, a state law making agricultural producers’ associations the
exclusive bargaining agents and requiring payment of service fees
by nonmember producers was held to counter a strong federal policy
protecting the right of farmers to join or not join such associa-
tions.1215 And a state assertion of the right to set minimum stream-
flow requirements different from those established by FERC in its
licensing capacity was denied as being preempted under the Fed-
eral Power Act, despite language requiring deference to state laws
“relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of wa-
ter.” 1216
     Contrarily, a comprehensive federal regulation of insecticides and
other such chemicals was held not to preempt a town ordinance that
required a permit for the spraying of pesticides, there being no con-
flict between requirements.1217 The application of state antitrust laws

flict analysis was appropriate, but he did not find that the state law achieved any
result that ERISA required.
