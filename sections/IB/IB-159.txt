ters of the Gulf of Mexico or Straits of Florida was sustained but
construed as not applying to sponges taken from the territorial wa-
ter of a state.853
     In Weber v. Freed,854 the Court upheld an act prohibiting the
importation and interstate transportation of prize-fight films or of
pictorial representation of prize fights. Chief Justice White grounded
his opinion for a unanimous Court on the complete and total con-
trol over foreign commerce possessed by Congress, in contrast im-
plicitly to its lesser power over interstate commerce.855 And, in Brolan
v. United States,856 the Court rejected as wholly inappropriate cita-
tion of cases dealing with interstate commerce on the question of
Congress’s power to prohibit foreign commerce. It has been earlier
noted, however, that the purported distinction is one that the Court
both previously to and subsequent to these opinions has rejected.
     Interstate Commerce: Power to Prohibit Questioned.—The
question whether Congress’s power to regulate commerce “among
the several States” embraced the power to prohibit it furnished the
topic of one of the most protracted debates in the entire history of
the Constitution’s interpretation, a debate the final resolution of which
in favor of congressional power is an event of first importance for
the future of American federalism. The issue was as early as 1841
brought forward by Henry Clay, in an argument before the Court
in which he raised the specter of an act of Congress forbidding the
interstate slave trade.857 The debate was concluded ninety-nine years
later by the decision in United States v. Darby,858 which sustained
the Fair Labor Standards Act.859
     Interstate Commerce: National Prohibitions and State Po-
lice Power.—The earliest acts prohibiting commerce were in the
nature of quarantine regulations and usually dealt solely with in-
terstate transportation. In 1884, the exportation or shipment in in-
terstate commerce of livestock having any infectious disease was
    853  223 U.S. 166 (1912); cf. United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19 (1947).
    854  239 U.S. 325 (1915).
     855 239 U.S. at 329.
     856 236 U.S. 216 (1915).
     857 Groves v. Slaughter, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 449, 488–89 (1841).
     858 312 U.S. 100 (1941).
     859 The judicial history of the argument may be examined in the majority and

dissenting opinions in Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251 (1918), a five-to-four de-
cision, in which the majority held Congress not to be empowered to ban from the
channels of interstate commerce goods made with child labor, since Congress’s power
was to prescribe the rule by which commerce was to be carried on and not to pro-
hibit it, except with regard to those things the character of which—diseased cattle,
lottery tickets—was inherently evil. With the majority opinion, compare Justice Stone’s
unanimous opinion in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 112–24 (1941), overrul-
ing Hammer v. Dagenhart. See also Corwin, The Power of Congress to Prohibit Com-
merce, 3 SELECTED ESSAYS ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 103 (1938).
