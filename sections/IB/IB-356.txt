making. In such cases the federal courts exercising jurisdiction be-
tween citizens of different States held themselves free to decide what
the state law was, and to enforce it as laid down by the State Su-
preme Court before the contracts were made rather than in later
decisions. They did not base this conclusion on Article I, § 10, of
the Federal Constitution, but on the state law as they determined
it, which, in diverse citizenship cases, under the third Article of the
Federal Constitution they were empowered to do. Burgess v. Selig-
man, 107 U.S. 20 [1883].” 2058 Although doubtless this was an avail-
able explanation in 1924, the decision in 1938, in Erie Railroad Co.
v. Tompkins,2059 so cut down the power of the federal courts to de-
cide diversity of citizenship cases according to their own notions of
“general principles of common law” as to raise the question whether
the Court will not be required eventually to put Gelpcke and its
companions and descendants squarely on the Contract Clause or
else abandon them.
    “Obligation” Defined.—A contract is analyzable into two ele-
ments: the agreement, which comes from the parties, and the obli-
gation, which comes from the law and makes the agreement bind-
ing on the parties. The concept of obligation is an importation from
the civil law and its appearance in the Contract Clause is sup-
posed to have been due to James Wilson, a graduate of Scottish
universities and a civilian. Actually, the term as used in the Con-
tract Clause has been rendered more or less superfluous by the doc-
trine that “[t]he laws which exist at the time and place of the mak-
ing of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and
form a part of it.” 2060 Hence, the Court sometimes recognizes the
term in its decisions applying the clause, and sometimes ignores it.
In Sturges v. Crowninshield,2061 Chief Justice Marshall defined “ob-
ligation of contract” as the law that binds a party “to perform his
undertaking,” but a little later the same year, in Dartmouth Col-
lege v. Woodward, he set forth the points presented for consider-
ation to be: “1. Is this contract protected by the constitution of the
United States? 2. Is it impaired by the acts under which the defen-
dant holds?” 2062 The word “obligation” undoubtedly implies that the
Constitution was intended to protect only executory contracts—i.e.,
