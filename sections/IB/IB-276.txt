spite the fact that the Constitution uses the term “discovery” rather
than “invention,” a patent may not be issued for the discovery of a
previously unknown phenomenon of nature. “If there is to be inven-
tion from such a discovery, it must come from the application of
the law of nature to a new and useful end.” 1503 In addition to refus-
ing to allow patents for natural phenomena and laws of nature, the
Court has held that abstract ideas and mathematical formulas may
not be patented,1504 for these are the “basic tools of scientific and
technological work” 1505 that should be “free to all men and re-
served to none.” 1506
    As for the mental processes that traditionally must be evi-
denced, the Court has held that an invention must display “more
ingenuity . . . than the work of a mechanic skilled in the art;” 1507
and, though combination patents have been at times sustained,1508
the accumulation of old devices is patentable “only when the whole
in some way exceeds the sum of its parts.” 1509 Though “inventive
genius” and slightly varying language have been appearing in judi-

interesting concurring opinion was filed by Justice Douglas for himself and Justice
Black: “It is not enough,” says Justice Douglas, “that an article is new and useful.
The Constitution never sanctioned the patenting of gadgets. Patents serve a higher
end—the advancement of science. An invention need not be as startling as an atomic
bomb to be patentable. But it has to be of such quality and distinction that masters
of the scientific field in which it falls will recognize it as an advance.” Id. at 154–
155. He then quotes the following from an opinion of Justice Bradley’s given 70 years
earlier:
     “It was never the object of those laws to grant a monopoly for every trifling
device, every shadow of a shade of an idea, which would naturally and spontane-
ously occur to any skilled mechanic or operator in the ordinary progress of manufac-
turers. Such an indiscriminate creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to ob-
struct than to stimulate invention. It creates a class of speculative schemers who
make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its
foam in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon
the industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real advancement
of the arts. It embarrasses the honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehen-
sions of concealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexatious account-
ings for profits made in good faith. (Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U.S. 192, 200 (1882)).”
