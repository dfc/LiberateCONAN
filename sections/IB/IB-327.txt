       Special Acts Concerning Claims
           The Necessary and Proper Clause enables Congress to pass spe-
       cial laws to require other departments of the government to pros-
       ecute or adjudicate particular claims, whether asserted by the gov-
       ernment itself or by private persons. In 1924,1859 Congress adopted
       a Joint Resolution directing the President to cause suit to be insti-
       tuted for the cancellation of certain oil leases alleged to have been
       obtained from the government by fraud and to prosecute such other
       actions and proceedings, civil and criminal, as were warranted by
       the facts. This resolution also authorized the appointment of spe-
       cial counsel to have charge of such litigation. Private acts provid-
       ing for a review of an order for compensation under the Longshore
       and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act,1860 or conferring jurisdic-
       tion upon the Court of Claims, after it had denied recovery, to hear
       and determine certain claims of a contractor against the govern-
       ment, have been held constitutional.1861

       Maritime Law
           Congress may implement the admiralty and maritime jurisdic-
       tion conferred upon the federal courts by revising and amending
       the maritime law that existed at the time the Constitution was ad-
       opted, but in so doing, it cannot go beyond the reach of that juris-
       diction.1862 This power cannot be delegated to the states; hence, acts
       of Congress that purported to make state workers’ compensation laws
       applicable to maritime cases were held unconstitutional.1863

    SECTION 9. Clause 1. The Migration or Importation of such
Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to
admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year
one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may
be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for
each Person.
