is not a contract in the sense of the Constitution,2151 nor is mar-
riage.2152 And whether a particular agreement is a valid contract is
a question for the courts, and finally for the Supreme Court, when
the protection of the contract clause is invoked.2153
     The question of the nature and source of the obligation of a con-
tract, which went by default in Fletcher v. Peck and the Dartmouth
College case, with such vastly important consequences, had eventu-
ally to be met and answered by the Court in connection with pri-
vate contracts. The first case involving such a contract to reach the
Supreme Court was Sturges v. Crowninshield,2154 in which a debtor
sought escape behind a state insolvency act of later date than his
note. The act was held inoperative, but whether this was because
of its retroactivity in this particular case or for the broader reason
that it assumed to excuse debtors from their promises was not at
the time made clear. As noted earlier, Chief Justice Marshall’s defi-
nition on this occasion of the obligation of a contract as the law
that binds the parties to perform their undertakings was not free
from ambiguity, owing to the uncertain connotation of the term
“law.” 2155
     These obscurities were finally cleared up for most cases in Ogden
v. Saunders,2156 in which the temporal relation of the statute and
the contract involved was exactly reversed—the former antedating
the latter. Chief Justice Marshall contended unsuccessfully that the
statute was void because it purported to release the debtor from
that original, intrinsic obligation that always attaches under natu-
ral law to the acts of free agents. “When,” he wrote, “we advert to
the course of reading generally pursued by American statesmen in
early life, we must suppose that the framers of our Constitution
were intimately acquainted with the writings of those wise and learned
men whose treatises on the laws of nature and nations have guided
public opinion on the subjects of obligation and contracts,” and that
