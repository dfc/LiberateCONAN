although some state courts have applied tests of this nature to the
disallowance of legislation, the U.S. Supreme Court has apparently
never done so.2112
     It is quite different with respect to the distinction that some
cases point out between, on the one hand, the franchises and privi-
leges that a corporation derives from its charter, and, on the other
hand, the rights of property and contract that accrue to it in the
course of its existence. Even the outright repeal of the former does
not wipe out the latter or cause them to escheat to the state. The
primary heirs of the defunct organization are its creditors, but what-
ever of value remains after their valid claims are met goes to the
former shareholders.2113 By the earlier weight of authority, how-
ever, persons who contract with companies whose charters are sub-
ject to legislative amendment or repeal do so at their own risk; any
“such contracts made between individuals and the corporation do
not vary or in any manner change or modify the relation between
the State and the corporation in respect to the right of the State to
alter, modify, or amend such a charter . . . .” 2114 But later holdings
becloud this rule.2115
     Corporation Subject to the Law and Police Power.—But sup-
pose that the state neglects to reserve the right to amend, alter, or
repeal. Is it, then, without power to control its corporate creatures?
By no means. Private corporations, like other private persons, are
always presumed to be subject to the legislative power of the state,
from which it follows that immunities conferred by charter are to
be treated as exceptions to an otherwise controlling rule. This prin-
ciple was recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in Providence Bank
v. Billings,2116 which held that, in the absence of express stipula-
tion or reasonable implication to the contrary in its charter, the bank
was subject to the state’s taxing power, notwithstanding that the
power to tax is the power to destroy.
     And of course the same principle is equally applicable to the
exercise by the state of its police powers. Thus, in what was per-
haps the leading case before the Civil War, the Supreme Court of
