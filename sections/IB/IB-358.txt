government . . . the subject is one in which the legislature of the
State may act according to its own judgment,” unrestrained by the
Constitution 2068—thereby drawing a line between “public” and “pri-
vate” corporations that remained undisturbed for more than half a
century.2069
    It has been subsequently held many times that municipal cor-
porations are mere instrumentalities of the state for the more con-
venient administration of local governments, whose powers may be
enlarged, abridged, or entirely withdrawn at the pleasure of the leg-
islature.2070 The same principle applies, moreover, to the property
rights that the municipality derives either directly or indirectly from
the state. This was first held as to the grant of a franchise to a
municipality to operate a ferry and has since then been recognized
as the universal rule.2071 It was stated in a case decided in 1923
that the distinction between the municipality as an agent of the
state for governmental purposes and as an organization to care for
local needs in a private or proprietary capacity, though it limited
the legal liability of municipalities for the negligent acts or omis-
sions of its officers or agents, did not, however, furnish ground for
the application of constitutional restraints against the state in fa-
vor of its own municipalities.2072 Thus, no contract rights were im-
paired by a statute relocating a county seat, even though the for-
mer location was by law to be “permanent” and the citizens of the
community had donated land and furnished bonds for the erection
of public buildings.2073 Similarly, a statute changing the boundar-
ies of a school district, giving to the new district the property within
its limits that had belonged to the former district, and requiring
the new district to assume the debts of the old district, did not im-
pair the obligation of contracts.2074 Nor was the Contract Clause
violated by state legislation authorizing state control over insol-
vent communities through a Municipal Finance Commission.2075
    2068  Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 629 (1819).
    2069  In Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1877), a category of “business affected with
a public interest” and whose property is “impressed with a public use” was recog-
nized. A corporation engaged in such a business becomes a “quasi-public” corpora-
tion, and the power of the state to regulate it is larger than in the case of a purely
private corporation. Because most corporations receiving public franchises are of this
character, the final result of Munn was to enlarge the police power of the state in
the case of the most important beneficiaries of the Dartmouth College decision.
