Constitutional Limitations on the Bankruptcy Power
     In the exercise of its bankruptcy powers, Congress must not trans-
gress the Fifth and Tenth Amendments. The Bankruptcy Act pro-
vides that use immunity may be granted “for persons required to
submit to examination, to testify, or to provide information” in a
bankruptcy case.1415 Congress may not take from a creditor specific
property previously acquired from a debtor, nor circumscribe the credi-
tor’s right to such an unreasonable extent as to deny him due pro-
cess of law; 1416 this principle, however, is subject to the Supreme
Court’s finding that a bankruptcy court has summary jurisdiction
for ordering the surrender of voidable preferences when the trustee
successfully counterclaims to a claim filed by the creditor receiving
such preferences.1417
     Because Congress may not supersede the power of a state to
determine how a corporation shall be formed, supervised, and dis-
solved, a corporation that has been dissolved by a decree of a state
court may not file a petition for reorganization under the Bank-
ruptcy Act.1418 But Congress may impair the obligation of a con-
tract and may extend the provisions of the bankruptcy laws to con-
tracts already entered into at the time of their passage.1419 Although
it may not subject the fiscal affairs of a political subdivision of a
state to the control of a federal bankruptcy court,1420 Congress may
empower such courts to entertain petitions by taxing agencies or
instrumentalities for a composition of their indebtedness where the
state has consented to the proceeding and the federal court is not
authorized to interfere with the fiscal or governmental affairs of such
petitioners.1421 Congress may recognize the laws of the state relat-
ing to dower, exemption, the validity of mortgages, priorities of pay-
ment and similar matters, even though such recognition leads to
different results from state to state; 1422 for, although bankruptcy
legislation must be uniform, the uniformity required is geographic,
not personal.
