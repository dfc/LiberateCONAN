law.1236 The Court subsequently narrowed the interpretation of this
ruling by holding in two cases that members who alleged union in-
terference with their existing or prospective employment relations
could not sue for damages but must file unfair labor practice charges
with the NLRB.1237 Gonzales was said to be limited to “purely inter-
nal union matters.” 1238 Finally, Gonzales, was abandoned in a five-
to-four decision in which the Court held that a person who alleged
that his union had misinterpreted its constitution and its collective
bargaining agreement with the individual’s employer in expelling
him from the union and causing him to be discharged from his em-
ployment because he was late paying his dues had to pursue his
federal remedies.1239 Justice Harlan wrote for the Court that, al-
though it was not likely that, in Gonzales, a state court resolution
of the scope of duty owed the member by the union would impli-
cate principles of federal law, state court resolution in this case in-
volved an interpretation of the contract’s union security clause, a
matter on which federal regulation is extensive.1240
    One other exception has been based, like the violence cases, on
the assumption that it concerns areas traditionally left to local law
into which Congress would not want to intrude. In Linn v. Plant
Guard Workers,1241 the Court permitted a state court adjudication
of a defamation action arising out of a labor dispute. And, in Letter
Carriers v. Austin,1242 the Court held that federal law preempts state
defamation laws in the context of labor disputes to the extent that
the state seeks to make actionable defamatory statements in labor
disputes published without knowledge of their falsity or in reckless
disregard of truth or falsity.
    However, a state tort action for the intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress occasioned through an alleged campaign of personal
abuse and harassment of a member of the union by the union and
its officials was held not preempted by federal labor law. Federal
law was not directed to the “outrageous conduct” alleged, and NLRB
resolution of the dispute would neither touch upon the claim of emo-
tional distress and physical injury nor award the plaintiff any com-
pensation. But state court jurisdiction, in order that there not be
