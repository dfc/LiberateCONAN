       drivers and as such was in fact intended to and did frustrate the
       purpose of the federal bankruptcy law, the giving of a fresh start
       unhampered by debt.1436
           If a state desires to participate in the assets of a bankruptcy, it
       must submit to the appropriate requirements of the bankruptcy court
       with respect to the filing of claims by a designated date. It cannot
       assert a claim for taxes by filing a demand at a later date.1437

       Coinage, Weights, and Measures
           The power “to coin money” and “regulate the value thereof ” has
       been broadly construed to authorize regulation of every phase of
       the subject of currency. Congress may charter banks and endow them
       with the right to issue circulating notes,1438 and it may restrain the
       circulation of notes not issued under its own authority.1439 To this
       end it may impose a prohibitive tax upon the circulation of the notes
       of state banks 1440 or of municipal corporations.1441 It may require
       the surrender of gold coin and of gold certificates in exchange for
       other currency not redeemable in gold. A plaintiff who sought pay-
       ment for the gold coin and certificates thus surrendered in an amount
       measured by the higher market value of gold was denied recovery
       on the ground that he had not proved that he would suffer any ac-
       tual loss by being compelled to accept an equivalent amount of other
       currency.1442 Inasmuch as “every contract for the payment of money,
       simply, is necessarily subject to the constitutional power of the gov-
       ernment over the currency, whatever that power may be, and the

       tice Blackmun for himself and Chief Justice Burger and Justices Harlan and Stew-
       art, argued, in line with the Reitz and Kesler majorities, that the provision at issue
       was merely an attempt to assure driving competence and care on the part of its
       citizens and had only tangential effect upon bankruptcy.
