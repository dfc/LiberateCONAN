an endorsement of whatever might be thought to promote the recov-
ery and expansion of the particular trade or industry. The Presi-
dent’s authority to approve, condition, or adopt codes on his own
initiative was similarly devoid of meaningful standards, and “virtu-
ally unfettered.” 64 This broad delegation was “without precedent.”
The Act supplied “no standards” for any trade or industry group,
and, unlike other broad delegations that had been upheld, did not
set policies that could be implemented by an administrative agency
required to follow “appropriate administrative procedure.” “Instead
of prescribing rules of conduct, [the Act] authorize[d] the making of
codes to prescribe them.” 65
     Since 1935, the Court has not struck down a delegation to an
administrative agency.66 Rather, the Court has approved, “without
deviation, Congress’s ability to delegate power under broad stan-
dards.” 67 The Court has upheld, for example, delegations to admin-
istrative agencies to determine “excessive profits” during war-
time; 68 to determine “unfair and inequitable distribution of voting
power” among securities holders; 69 to fix “fair and equitable” com-
modities prices; 70 to determine “just and reasonable” rates; 71 and
to regulate broadcast licensing as the “public interest, convenience,
or necessity require.” 72 During all this time the Court “has not seen
fit . . . to enlarge in the slightest [the] relatively narrow holdings”
of Panama Refining and Schechter.73 Again and again, the Court
has distinguished the two cases, sometimes by finding adequate stan-
dards in the challenged statute,74 sometimes by contrasting the vast
scope of the power delegated by the National Industrial Recovery
Act,75 and sometimes by pointing to required administrative find-

by criminal sanction, and that regulatory power was delegated to private individu-
als. See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373 n.7 (1989).

delegation grounds, but that delegation was to private entities. Carter v. Carter Coal

delegation of authority to deal with problems of the banking industry, where there
was “accumulated experience” derived from long regulation and close supervision);
