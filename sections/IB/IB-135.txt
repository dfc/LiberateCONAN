necessary for navigability that the use should be continuous. . . .
Even absence of use over long periods of years, because of changed
conditions, . . . does not affect the navigability of rivers in the con-
stitutional sense.” 733
    Furthermore, the Court defined the purposes for which Con-
gress may regulate navigation in the broadest terms. “It cannot prop-
erly be said that the constitutional power of the United States over
its waters is limited to control for navigation. . . . That authority
is as broad as the needs of commerce. . . . Flood protection, water-
shed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through uti-
lization of power are likewise parts of commerce control.” 734 These
views the Court has since reiterated.735 Nor is it by virtue of Con-
gress’s power over navigation alone that the National Government
may develop water power. Its war powers and powers of expendi-
ture in furtherance of the common defense and the general welfare
supplement its powers over commerce in this respect.736

Congressional Regulation of Land Transportation
    Federal Stimulation of Land Transportation.—The settle-
ment of the interior of the country led Congress to seek to facili-
tate access by first encouraging the construction of highways. In
successive acts, it authorized construction of the Cumberland and
the National Road from the Potomac across the Alleghenies to the
Ohio, reserving certain public lands and revenues from land sales
for construction of public roads to new states granted statehood.737
Acquisition and settlement of California stimulated interest in rail-
way lines to the west, but it was not until the Civil War that Con-
gress voted aid in the construction of a line from the Missouri River
to the Pacific; four years later, it chartered the Union Pacific Com-
pany.738
    The litigation growing out of these and subsequent activities settled
several propositions. First, Congress may provide highways and rail-
ways for interstate transportation; 739 second, it may charter pri-
vate corporations for that purpose; third, it may vest such corpora-

    739 The result then as well as now might have followed from Congress’s power

of spending, independently of the Commerce Clause, as well as from its war and
postal powers, which were also invoked by the Court in this connection.
