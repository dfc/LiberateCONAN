rule when it subpoenaed the witness for a public hearing and then
in failing to consider as a Committee his request for a closed ses-
sion.247
    The Court has blown hot and cold on the issue of a quorum as
a prerequisite to a valid contempt citation, and no firm statement
of a rule is possible, although it seems probable that no quorum is
ordinarily necessary.248
    Protection of Witnesses; Constitutional Guarantees.—
“[T]he Congress, in common with all branches of the Government,
must exercise its powers subject to the limitations placed by the
Constitution on governmental action, more particularly in the con-
text of this case, the relevant limitations of the Bill of Rights.” 249
Just as the Constitution places limitations on Congress’s power to
legislate, so it limits the power to investigate. This section ad-
dresses the limitations the Bill of Rights places on the scope and
nature of the congressional power to inquire.
    The most extensive amount of litigation in this area has in-
volved the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed against
governmental abridgment by the Fifth Amendment. Observance of
the privilege by congressional committees has been so uniform that
no court has ever held that it must be observed, though dicta are
plentiful.250 Thus, the cases have explored not the issue of the right
to rely on the privilege but rather the manner and extent of its ap-
plication.
    There is no prescribed form in which one must plead the privi-
lege. When a witness refused to answer a question about Commu-
nist Party affiliations and based his refusal upon the assertion by
a prior witness of “the first amendment supplemented by the fifth,”
the Court held that he had sufficiently invoked the privilege, at least
in the absence of committee inquiry seeking to force him to adopt a
more precise stand.251 If the committee suspected that the witness
was being purposely vague, in order perhaps to avoid the stigma
    247 Failure to follow its own rules was again an issue in Gojack v. United States,

384 U.S. 702 (1966), in which the Court noted that, although a committee rule re-
quired the approval of a majority of the Committee before a “major” investigation
was initiated, such approval had not been sought before a Subcommittee proceeded.
    248 In Christoffel v. United States, 338 U.S. 84 (1949), the Court held that a

witness can be found guilty of perjury only where a quorum of the committee is
present at the time the perjury is committed; it is not enough to prove that a quo-
rum was present when the hearing began. But, in United States v. Bryan, 339 U.S.
323 (1950), the Court ruled that a quorum was not required under the statute pun-
ishing refusal to honor a valid subpoena issued by an authorized committee.
