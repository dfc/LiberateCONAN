       that apparently had been purchased by the United States. Invok-
       ing the Necessary and Proper Clause, Chief Justice Marshall de-
       duced the power to collect a debt from the power to pay its obliga-
       tions by the following reasoning: “The government is to pay the debt
       of the Union, and must be authorized to use the means which ap-
       pear to itself most eligible to effect that object. It has, conse-
       quently, a right to make remittances by bills or otherwise, and to
       take those precautions which will render the transaction safe.” 651

   Clause 2. The Congress shall have Power * * * To borrow
Money on the credit of the United States.
                              BORROWING POWER
           The original draft of the Constitution reported to the conven-
       tion by its Committee of Detail empowered Congress “To borrow money
       and emit bills on the credit of the United States.” 652 When this sec-
       tion was reached in the debates, Gouverneur Morris moved to strike
       out the clause “and emit bills on the credit of the United States.”
       Madison suggested that it might be sufficient “to prohibit the mak-
       ing them a tender.” After a spirited exchange of views on the sub-
       ject of paper money, the convention voted, nine states to two, to
       delete the words “and emit bills.” 653 Nevertheless, in 1870, the Court
       relied in part upon this clause in holding that Congress had author-
       ity to issue treasury notes and to make them legal tender in satis-
       faction of antecedent debts.654
           When it borrows money “on the credit of the United States,”
       Congress creates a binding obligation to pay the debt as stipulated
       and cannot thereafter vary the terms of its agreement. A law pur-
       porting to abrogate a clause in government bonds calling for pay-
       ment in gold coin was held to contravene this clause, although the
       creditor was denied a remedy in the absence of a showing of actual
       damage.655

   Clause 3. The Congress shall have Power * * * To regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States,
and with the Indian Tribes.
