dard is to have any prominent place in ex post facto jurisprudence
may be an interesting question, but it is problematical whether the

ing experts,2042 have been sustained over the objection that they
were ex post facto. It was suggested in a number of these cases,
and two decisions were rendered precisely on the basis, that the
mode of procedure might be changed only so long as the “substan-

from twelve-person jury to an eight-person jury void under clause), and Kring v. Mis-

offense, so that defendant could be tried on the more serious charge, a violation of
the clause).

ruled Kring and Thompson v. Utah.
