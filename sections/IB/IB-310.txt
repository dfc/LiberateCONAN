ated.1731 Against a contention that Congress’s war powers had been
used to achieve the result, the Court struck down for the second
time in history a congressional statute as an infringement of the
First Amendment.1732 It voided a law making it illegal for any mem-
ber of a “communist-action organization” to work in a defense facil-
ity.1733 The majority reasoned that the law overbroadly required a
person to choose between his First Amendment-protected right of
association and his right to hold a job, without attempting to distin-
guish between those persons who constituted a threat and those who
did not.1734
     On the other hand, in New York Times Co. v. United States,1735
a majority of the Court agreed that in appropriate circumstances
the First Amendment would not preclude a prior restraint of publi-
cation of information that might result in a sufficient degree of harm
to the national interest, although a different majority concurred in
denying the government’s request for an injunction in that case.1736
     Enemy Aliens.—The Alien Enemy Act of 1798 authorized the
President to deport any alien or to license him to reside within the
United States at any place to be designated by the President.1737
Though critical of the measure, many persons conceded its constitu-
tionality on the theory that Congress’s power to declare war car-
ried with it the power to treat the citizens of a foreign power against
which war has been declared as enemies entitled to summary jus-
tice.1738 A similar statute was enacted during World War I 1739 and
was held valid in Ludecke v. Watkins.1740
     During World War II, in Ex parte Quirin, the Court unani-
mously upheld the power of the President to order to trial before a
military tribunal German saboteurs captured within the United
     1731 E.g., Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957); Albertson v. Subversive

Activities Control Bd., 382 U.S. 70 (1965); United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437
(1965).

     1734 389 U.S. at 264–66. Justices Harlan and White dissented, contending that

the right of association should have been balanced against the public interest and
finding the weight of the latter the greater. Id. at 282.
     1735 403 U.S. 713 (1971).
     1736 The result in the case was reached by a six-to-three majority. The three

dissenters, Chief Justice Burger, 403 U.S. at 748, Justice Harlan, id. at 752, and
Justice Blackmun, id. at 759, would have granted an injunction in the case; Jus-
tices Stewart and White, id. at 727, 730, would not in that case but could conceive
of cases in which they would.
