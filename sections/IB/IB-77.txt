“A Quorum To Do Business”
    For many years the view prevailed in the House of Representa-
tives that it was necessary for a majority of the members to vote
on any proposition submitted to the House in order to satisfy the
constitutional requirement for a quorum. It was a common practice
for the opposition to break a quorum by refusing to vote. This was
changed in 1890, by a ruling made by Speaker Reed and later em-
bodied in Rule XV of the House, that members present in the cham-
ber but not voting would be counted in determining the presence of
a quorum.399 The Supreme Court upheld this rule in United States
v. Ballin,400 saying that the capacity of the House to transact busi-
ness is “created by the mere presence of a majority,” and that since
the Constitution does not prescribe any method for determining the
presence of such majority “it is therefore within the competency of
the House to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably cer-
tain to ascertain the fact.” 401 The rules of the Senate provide for
the ascertainment of a quorum only by a roll call,402 but in a few
cases it has held that if a quorum is present, a proposition can be
determined by the vote of a lesser number of members.403

Rules of Proceedings
    In the exercise of their constitutional power to determine their
rules of proceedings, the Houses of Congress may not “ignore con-
stitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should
be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding
established by the rule and the result which is sought to be at-
tained. But within these limitations all matters of method are open
to the determination of the house. . . . The power to make rules is
not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a continuous power,
always subject to be exercised by the house, and within the limita-
tions suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body

not prevent a state from conducting a recount of ballots cast in such an election any
more than it prevents the initial counting by a state. Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U.S.
