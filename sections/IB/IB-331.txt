ers.1885 The clause thus prohibits all legislative acts, “no matter what
their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily as-
certainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punish-
ment on them without a judicial trial. . . .” 1886 That the Court has
applied the clause dynamically is revealed by a consideration of the
three cases in which acts of Congress have been struck down as
violating it.1887 In Ex parte Garland,1888 the Court struck down a
statute that required attorneys to take an oath that they had taken
no part in the Confederate rebellion against the United States be-
fore they could practice in federal courts. The statute, and a state
constitutional amendment requiring a similar oath of persons be-
fore they could practice certain professions,1889 were struck down
as legislative acts inflicting punishment on a specific group the mem-
bers of which had taken part in the rebellion and therefore could
not truthfully take the oath. The clause then lay unused until 1946
when the Court used it to strike down a rider to an appropriations
bill forbidding the use of money appropriated in the bill to pay the
salaries of three named persons whom the House of Representa-
tives wished discharged because they were deemed to be “subver-
sive.” 1890
     Then, in United States v. Brown,1891 a sharply divided Court
held void as a bill of attainder a statute making it a crime for a
member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer or as an em-
ployee of a labor union. Congress could, Chief Justice Warren wrote
for the majority, under its commerce power, protect the economy from
harm by enacting a prohibition generally applicable to any person
who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics mak-
ing him likely in Congress’s view to initiate political strikes or other
harmful deeds and leaving it to the courts to determine whether a
particular person committed the specified acts or possessed the speci-
fied characteristics. It was impermissible, however, for Congress to
designate a class of persons—members of the Communist Party—as
being forbidden to hold union office.1892 The dissenters viewed the

     1885 United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 442–46 (1965). Four dissenting Jus-

tices, however, denied that any separation of powers concept underlay the clause.
