import transit.2223 Thus, a company’s inventory of imported tires main-
tained at its whole distribution warehouse could be included in the
state’s tax upon the entire inventory. The clause does not prohibit
every “tax” with some impact upon imports or exports but reaches
rather exactions directed only at imports or exports or commercial
activity therein as such.2224
Inspection Laws
     Inspection laws “are confined to such particulars as, in the esti-
mation of the legislature and according to the customs of trade, are
deemed necessary to fit the inspected article for the market, by giv-
ing the purchaser public assurance that the article is in that condi-
tion, and of that quality, which makes it merchantable and fit for
use or consumption.” 2225 In Turner v. Maryland,2226 the Court listed
as recognized elements of inspection laws, the “quality of the ar-
ticle, form, capacity, dimensions, and weight of package, mode of
putting up, and marking and branding of various kinds . . . ” 2227
It sustained as an inspection law a charge for storage and inspec-
tion imposed upon every hogshead of tobacco grown in the state and
intended for export, which the law required to be brought to a state
warehouse to be inspected and branded. The Court has cited this
section as a recognition of a general right of the states to pass in-
spection laws, and to bring within their reach articles of interstate,
as well as of foreign, commerce.2228 But on the ground that, “it has
never been regarded as within the legitimate scope of inspection
laws to forbid trade in respect to any known article of commerce,
irrespective of its condition and quality, merely on account of its
intrinsic nature and the injurious consequence of its use or abuse,”
     2223 Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976), overruling Low v. Aus-

tin, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 29 (1872), expressly, and, necessarily, Hooven & Allison Co. v.
Evatt, 324 U.S. 652 (1945), among others. The latter case was expressly overruled
in Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.S. 353 (1984), involving the same tax
and the same parties. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 534
(1959), property taxes were sustained on the basis that the materials taxed had lost
their character as imports. On exports, see Selliger v. Kentucky, 213 U.S. 200 (1909)
(property tax levied on warehouse receipts for whiskey exported to Germany in-
valid). See also Itel Containers Int’l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U.S. 60, 76–78 (1993),
and see id. at 81–82 (Justice Scalia concurring).
     2224 Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276, 290–94 (1976). Accord, R. J.

Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Durham County, 479 U.S. 130 (1986) (tax on imported to-
bacco stored for aging in customs-bonded warehouse and destined for domestic manu-
facture and sale); but cf. Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, 459 U.S. 145, 154 (1982)
(similar tax on goods stored in customs-bonded warehouse is preempted “by Con-
gress’s comprehensive regulation of customs duties;” case, however, dealt with goods
stored for export).

     2226 107 U.S. 38 (1883).
     2227 107 U.S. at 55.
