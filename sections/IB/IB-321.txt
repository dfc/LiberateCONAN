       Reservation of Jurisdiction by States
           For more than a century the Supreme Court kept alive, by re-
       peated dicta,1814 the doubt expressed by Justice Story “whether Con-
       gress are by the terms of the Constitution, at liberty to purchase
       lands for forts, dockyards, etc., with the consent of a State legisla-
       ture, where such consent is so qualified that it will not justify the
       ‘exclusive legislation’ of Congress there. It may well be doubted if
       such consent be not utterly void.” 1815 But when the issue was squarely
       presented in 1937, the Court ruled that, when the United States
       purchases property within a state with the consent of the latter, it
       is valid for the state to convey, and for the United States to accept,
       “concurrent jurisdiction” over such land, the state reserving to it-
       self the right to execute process “and such other jurisdiction and
       authority over the same as is not inconsistent with the jurisdiction
       ceded to the United States.” 1816 The holding logically renders the
       second half of clause 17 superfluous. In a companion case, the Court
       ruled further that even if a general state statute purports to cede
       exclusive jurisdiction, such jurisdiction does not pass unless the United
       States accepts it.1817

     Clause 18. The Congress shall have Power * * * To make
all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by
the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in
any Department or Officer thereof.

       Scope and Operation
           The Necessary and Proper Clause, sometimes called the “coeffi-
       cient” or “elastic” clause, is an enlargement, not a constriction, of
       the powers expressly granted to Congress. Chief Justice Marshall’s
       classic opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland 1818 set the standard in
       words that reverberate to this day. “Let the end be legitimate,” he
       wrote, “let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means
       which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which
