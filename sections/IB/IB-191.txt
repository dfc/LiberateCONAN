lation must be uniform and thus could not be left to the states.1027
The Court deemed “reasonable” and therefore constitutional many
state regulations requiring a fair and adequate service for its inhab-
itants by railway companies conducting interstate service within its
borders, as long as there was no unnecessary burden on com-
merce.1028 A marked tolerance for a class of regulations that argu-
ably furthered public safety was long exhibited by the Court,1029 even
in instances in which the safety connection was tenuous.1030 Of par-
ticular controversy were “full-crew” laws, represented as safety mea-
sures, that were attacked by the companies as “feather-bedding”
rules.1031
    Similarly, motor vehicle regulations have met mixed fates. Ba-
sically, it has always been recognized that states, in the interest of
public safety and conservation of public highways, may enact and
enforce comprehensive licensing and regulation of motor vehicles us-
ing its facilities.1032 Indeed, states were permitted to regulate many
of the local activities of interstate firms and thus the interstate op-

     1027 Wabash, S. L. & P. Ry. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886). The power of the

states generally to set rates had been approved in Chicago, B. & Q. R.R. v. Iowa, 94
U.S. 155 (1877), and Peik v. Chicago & N.W. Ry., 94 U.S. 164 (1877). After the Wabash
decision, states retained power to set rates for passengers and freight taken up and
put down within their borders. Wisconsin R.R. Comm’n v. Chicago, B. & Q. R.R.,
257 U.S. 563 (1922).
     1028 Generally, the Court drew the line at regulations that provided for ad-

equate service, not any and all service. Thus, one class of cases dealt with require-
ments that trains stop at designated cities and towns. The regulations were upheld
in such cases as Gladson v. Minnesota, 166 U.S. 427 (1897), and Lake Shore & Mich.
South. Ry. v. Ohio, 173 U.S. 285 (1899), and invalidated in Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Illi-
nois, 163 U.S. 142 (1896). See Chicago, B. & Q. R.R. v. Wisconsin R.R. Comm’n, 237
U.S. 220, 226 (1915); St. Louis & S. F. Ry. v. Public Service Comm’n, 254 U.S. 535,
536–537 (1921). The cases were extremely fact-specific.
     1029 E.g., Smith v. Alabama, 124 U.S. 465 (1888) (required locomotive engineers

to be examined and licensed by the state, until Congress should deem otherwise);
New York, N.H. & H. R.R. v. New York, 165 U.S. 628 (1897) (forbidding heating of
passenger cars by stoves); Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. v. Arkansas, 219 U.S. 453 (1911)
(requiring three brakemen on freight trains of more than 25 cars).
     1030 E.g., Terminal Ass’n v. Trainmen, 318 U.S. 1 (1943) (requiring railroad to

provide caboose cars for its employees); Hennington v. Georgia, 163 U.S. 299 (1896)
(forbidding freight trains to run on Sundays). But see Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Blackwell,
244 U.S. 310 (1917) (voiding as too onerous on interstate transportation a law requir-
ing trains to come to almost a complete stop at all grade crossings, when there were
124 highway crossings at grade in 123 miles, doubling the running time).
     1031 Four cases over a lengthy period sustained the laws. Chicago, R.I. & Pac.

Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, 219 U.S. 453 (1911); St. Louis, I. Mt. & So. Ry. v. Arkansas, 240
U.S. 518 (1916); Missouri Pacific R.R. v. Norwood, 283 U.S. 249 (1931); Brotherhood
of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen v. Chicago, R.I. & P. R.R., 382 U.S. 423 (1966).
In the latter case, the Court noted the extensive and conflicting record with regard
to safety, but it then ruled that with the issue in so much doubt it was peculiarly a
legislative choice.
     1032 Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U.S. 610 (1915); Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U.S.

160 (1916).
