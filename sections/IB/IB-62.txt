as well, was erratic.324 But in Powell v. McCormack,325 it was con-
clusively established that the qualifications listed in clause 2 are
exclusive 326 and that Congress could not add to them by excluding
Members-elect not meeting the additional qualifications.327
    Powell was excluded from the 90th Congress on grounds that
he had asserted an unwarranted privilege and immunity from the
process of a state court, that he had wrongfully diverted House funds
for his own uses, and that he had made false reports on the expen-
ditures of foreign currency.328 The Court determination that he had
been wrongfully excluded proceeded in the main from the Court’s
analysis of historical developments, the Convention debates, and tex-
tual considerations. This process led the Court to conclude that Con-
gress’s power under Article I, § 5 to judge the qualifications of its
Members was limited to ascertaining the presence or absence of the
standing qualifications prescribed in Article I, § 2, cl. 2, and per-
haps in other express provisions of the Constitution.329 The conclu-
sion followed because the English parliamentary practice and the
colonial legislative practice at the time of the drafting of the Con-
stitution, after some earlier deviations, had settled into a policy that
exclusion was a power exercisable only when the Member-elect failed
to meet a standing qualification,330 because in the Constitutional
Convention the Framers had defeated provisions allowing Con-
     324 In 1870, the House excluded a Member-elect who had been re-elected after

resigning earlier in the same Congress when expulsion proceedings were instituted
against him for selling appointments to the Military Academy. Id. at § 464. A Member-
elect was excluded in 1899 because of his practice of polygamy, id. at 474–80, but
the Senate refused, after adopting a rule requiring a two-thirds vote, to exclude a
Member-elect on those grounds. Id. at §§ 481–483. The House twice excluded a so-
cialist Member-elect in the wake of World War I on allegations of disloyalty. 6 CAN-

     325 395 U.S. 486 (1969). The Court divided eight to one, Justice Stewart dissent-

ing on the ground that the case was moot. Powell’s continuing validity was affirmed
in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995), both by the Court in its
holding that the qualifications set out in the Constitution are exclusive and may not
be added to by either Congress or the states, id. at 787–98, and by the dissenters,
who would hold that Congress, for different reasons could not add to qualifications,
although the states could. Id. at 875–76.
     326 The Court declined to reach the question whether the Constitution in fact

does impose other qualifications. 395 U.S. at 520 n.41 (possibly Article I, § 3, cl. 7,
disqualifying persons impeached, Article I, § 6, cl. 2, incompatible offices, and § 3 of
the Fourteenth Amendment). It is also possible that the oath provision of Article VI,
cl. 3, could be considered a qualification. See Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116, 129–131
(1966).
