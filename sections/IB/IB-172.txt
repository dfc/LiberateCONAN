erwise go without it. In addition, the mandate forces healthy indi-
viduals into the insurance risk pool, thus allowing insurers to subsidize
the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals they are now re-
quired to accept.
     Chief Justice Roberts, in a controlling opinion,929 suggested that
Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce presupposes
the existence of a commercial activity to regulate. Further, his opin-
ion noted that the commerce power had been uniformly described
in previous cases as involving the regulation of an “activity.” 930 The
individual mandate, on the other hand, compels an individual to
become active in commerce on the theory that the individual’s inac-
tivity affects interstate commerce. Justice Roberts suggested that
regulation of individuals because they are doing nothing would re-
sult in an unprecedented expansion of congressional authority with
few discernable limitations. While recognizing that most people are
likely to seek health care at some point in their lives, Justice Rob-
erts noted that there was no precedent for the argument that indi-
viduals who might engage in a commercial activity in the future
could, on that basis, be regulated today.931 The Chief Justice simi-
larly rejected the argument that the Necessary and Proper Clause
could provide this additional authority. Rather than serving as a
“incidental” adjunct to the Commerce Clause, reliance on the Nec-
essary and Proper Clause in this instance would, according to the
Chief Justice, create a substantial expansion of federal authority to
regulate persons not otherwise subject to such regulation.932
    Civil Rights.—It had been generally established some time ago
that Congress had power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit
racial discrimination in the use of the channels of commerce.933 The
power under the clause to forbid discrimination within the states
was firmly and unanimously sustained by the Court when Con-
gress in 1964 enacted a comprehensive measure outlawing discrimi-
nation because of race or color in access to public accommodations
with a requisite connection to interstate commerce.934 Hotels and
     929 Although no other Justice joined Chief Justice Robert’s opinion, four dissent-

ing Justices reached similar conclusions regarding the Commerce Clause and the
Necessary and Proper Clause. NFIB, 567 U.S. ___, No. 11–393, slip op. at 4–16 (joint
