the Court in Gravel v. United States,455 held that a grand jury could
validly inquire into the processes by which the Member obtained
classified government documents and into the arrangements for sub-
sequent private republication of these documents, since neither ac-
tion involved protected conduct. “While the Speech or Debate Clause
recognizes speech, voting and other legislative acts as exempt from
liability that might otherwise attach, it does not privilege either Sena-
tor or aide to violate an otherwise valid criminal law in preparing
for or implementing legislative acts.” 456
    Congressional Employees.—Until recently, the Court distin-
guished between Members of Congress, who were immune from suit
arising out of their legislative activities, and legislative employees
who participate in the same activities under the direction of a Mem-
ber.457 Thus, in Kilbourn v. Thompson,458 the sergeant at arms of
the House was held liable for false imprisonment because he ex-
ecuted the resolution ordering Kilbourn arrested and imprisoned.
Dombrowski v. Eastland 459 held that a subcommittee counsel might
be liable in damages for actions as to which the chairman of the
committee was immune from suit. And, in Powell v. McCormack,460
the Court held that the presence of House of Representative employ-
ees as defendants in a suit for declaratory judgment gave the fed-
eral courts jurisdiction to review the propriety of the plaintiff ’s ex-
clusion from office by vote of the House.
    Upon full consideration of the question, however, the Court, in
Gravel v. United States,461 accepted a series of contentions urged
upon it not only by the individual Senator but by the Senate itself
appearing by counsel as amicus: “that it is literally impossible, in
view of the complexities of the modern legislative process, with Con-
gress almost constantly in session and matters of legislative con-
cern constantly proliferating, for Members of Congress to perform
their legislative tasks without the help of aides and assistants; that
the day-to-day work of such aides is so critical to the Members’ per-
    455 408 U.S. 606 (1972).
    456 408 U.S. at 626.
    457 Language in some of the Court’s earlier opinions had indicated that the privi-

lege “is less absolute, although applicable,” when a legislative aide is sued, without
elaboration of what was meant. Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U.S. 82, 85 (1967);
Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 378 (1951). In Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S.
647 (1963), the Court had imposed substantial obstacles to the possibility of recov-
ery in appropriate situations by holding that a federal cause of action was lacking
and remitting litigants to state courts and state law grounds. The case is probably
no longer viable, however, after Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403
U.S. 388 (1971).
    458 103 U.S. 168 (1881).
    459 387 U.S. 82 (1967).
    460 395 U.S. 486 (1969).
    461 408 U.S. 606 (1972).
