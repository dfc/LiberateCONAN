lation of interstate activities might be fully effectuated.692 In other
cases, the clause may not have been directly cited, but the dictates
of Chief Justice Marshall have been used to justify more expansive
applications of the commerce power.693
    Federalism Limits on Exercise of Commerce Power.—As is
recounted below, prior to reconsideration of the federal commerce
power in the 1930s, the Court in effect followed a doctrine of “dual
federalism,” under which Congress’s power to regulate much activ-
ity depended on whether it had a “direct” rather than an “indirect”
effect on interstate commerce.694 When the restrictive interpreta-
tion was swept away during and after the New Deal, the question
of federalism limits respecting congressional regulation of private
activities became moot. However, in a number of instances the states
engaged in commercial activities that would be regulated by fed-
eral legislation if the enterprise were privately owned, and the Court
easily sustained application of federal law to these state propri-
etary activities.695 However, as Congress began to extend regula-
tion to state governmental activities, the judicial response was in-
consistent and wavering.696 Although the Court may shift again to
constrain federal power on federalism grounds, at the present time
the rule is that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause
to regulate the states as states in some circumstances, namely, when
the federal statutory provisions “commandeer” a state’s legislative
or executive authority in order to implement a regulatory pro-
gram.697

     692 E.g., Houston & Texas Ry. v. United States, 234 U.S. 342 (1914) (necessary

for ICC to regulate rates of an intrastate train in order to effectuate its rate setting
for a competing interstate train); Wisconsin R.R. Comm’n v. Chicago, B. & Q. R.R.,
257 U.S. 563 (1922) (same); Southern Ry. v. United States, 222 U.S. 20 (1911) (up-
holding requirement of same safety equipment on intrastate as interstate trains).
See also Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942); United States v. Wrightwood Dairy
Co., 315 U.S. 110 (1942); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005).
     693 See, e.g., United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 115–16 (1941).
     694 E.g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895); Hammer v. Dagenhart,

247 U.S. 251 (1918). Of course, there existed much of this time a parallel doctrine
under which federal power was not so limited. E.g., Houston & Texas Ry. v. United
States (The Shreveport Rate Case), 234 U.S. 342 (1914).
     695 E.g., California v. United States, 320 U.S. 577 (1944); California v. Taylor,

353 U.S. 553 (1957).
     696 For example, federal regulation of the wages and hours of certain state and

local governmental employees has alternatively been upheld and invalidated. See
Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183 (1968), overruled in National League of Cities v.
Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), overruled in Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth.,
469 U.S. 528 (1985).
     697 New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992); Printz v. United States, 521

U.S. 898 (1997). For elaboration, see the discussions under the Supremacy Clause
and under the Tenth Amendment.
