     On the same ground of public agency, neither appointment nor
election to public office creates a contract in the sense of Article I,
§ 10, whether as to tenure, or salary, or duties, all of which re-
main, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned,
subject to legislative modification or outright repeal.2076 Indeed, there
can be no such thing in this country as property in office, although
the common law sustained a different view sometimes reflected in
early cases.2077 When, however, services have once been rendered,
there arises an implied contract that they shall be compensated at
the rate in force at the time they were rendered.2078 Also, an ex-
press contract between the state and an individual for the perfor-
mance of specific services falls within the protection of the Consti-
tution. Thus, a contract made by the governor pursuant to a statute
authorizing the appointment of a commissioner to conduct, over a
period of years, a geological, mineralogical, and agricultural survey
of the state, for which a definite sum had been authorized, was held
to have been impaired by repeal of the statute.2079 But a resolution
of a local board of education reducing teachers’ salaries for the school
year 1933–1934, pursuant to an act of the legislature authorizing
such action, was held not to impair the contract of a teacher who,
having served three years, was by earlier legislation exempt from
having his salary reduced except for inefficiency or misconduct.2080
Similarly, the Court held that an Illinois statute that reduced the
annuity payable to retired teachers under an earlier act did not vio-
late the Contract Clause, because it had not been the intention of
the earlier act to propose a contract but only to put into effect a
general policy.2081 On the other hand, the right a teacher whose po-
sition had become “permanent” under the Indiana Teachers Tenure
Act of 1927, to continued employment was held to be contractual
and to have been impaired by the repeal in 1933 of the earlier act.2082
