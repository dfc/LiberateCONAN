vidual; 1592 in contrast to the Articles of Confederation, they did not
wish to forego entirely the advantages of executive efficiency nor to
entrust the matter solely to a branch so close to popular pas-
sions.1593
    The result of these conflicting considerations was that the Con-
vention amended the clause so as to give Congress the power to
“declare war.” 1594 Although this change could be read to give Con-
gress the mere formal function of recognizing a state of hostilities,
in the context of the Convention proceedings it appears more likely
the change was intended to insure that the President was empow-
ered to repel sudden attacks 1595 without awaiting congressional ac-
tion and to make clear that the conduct of war was vested exclu-
sively in the President.1596
     An early controversy revolved about the issue of the Presi-
dent’s powers and the necessity of congressional action when hos-
tilities are initiated against us rather than the Nation instituting
armed conflict. The Bey of Tripoli, in the course of attempting to
extort payment for not molesting United States shipping, declared
war upon the United States, and a debate began whether Congress
had to enact a formal declaration of war to create a legal status of
war. President Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to the Mediter-
ranean to protect our ships but limited its mission to defense in
the narrowest sense of the term. Attacked by a Tripolitan cruiser,
one of the frigates subdued it, disarmed it, and, pursuant to instruc-
tions, released it. Jefferson in a message to Congress announced
his actions as in compliance with constitutional limitations on his
authority in the absence of a declaration of war.1597 Hamilton es-

son and Gerry noted the change would “leav[e] to the Executive the power to repel

     1596 Connecticut originally voted against the amendment to substitute “declare”

for “make” but “on the remark by Mr. King that ‘make’ war might be understood to
‘conduct’ it which was an Executive function, Mr. Ellsworth gave up his opposition,
and the vote of Connecticut was changed. . . .” Id. at 319. The contemporary and
subsequent judicial interpretation was to the understanding set out in the text. Cf.

powers of war being, by the Constitution of the United States, vested in congress,
the acts of that body alone can be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry.”); Ex
