eral principle.412 These facts have given rise to disagreement as to
the constitutionality of the filibuster as applied to judicial nominees—
disagreement over whether the “Advice and Consent” of the Senate
means the majority of the Senate and not a super-majority. The con-
stitutionality of the filibuster has twice been challenged in court,
but both times the challenge was dismissed for lack of standing.413

Powers of the Houses Over Members
    Congress has authority to make it an offense against the United
States for a Member, during his continuance in office, to receive com-
pensation for services before a government department in relation
to proceedings in which the United States is interested. Such a stat-
ute does not interfere with the legitimate authority of the Senate
or House over its own Members.414 In upholding the power of the
Senate to investigate charges that some Senators had been specu-
lating in sugar stocks during the consideration of a tariff bill, the
Supreme Court asserted that “the right to expel extends to all cases
where the offence is such as in the judgment of the Senate is incon-
sistent with the trust and duty of a Member.” 415 It cited with ap-
parent approval the action of the Senate in expelling William Blount
in 1797 for attempting to seduce from his duty an American agent
among the Indians and for negotiating for services in behalf of the
British Government among the Indians—conduct which was not a
“statutable offense” and which was not committed in his official char-
acter, nor during the session of Congress nor at the seat of govern-
ment.416
    In Powell v. McCormack,417 a suit challenging the exclusion of
a Member-elect from the House of Representatives, it was argued
that, because the vote to exclude was actually in excess of two-
thirds of the Members, it should be treated simply as an expulsion.
The Court rejected the argument, noting that House precedents were

(Madison, responding to objections that the Constitution should have required “more
than a majority . . . for a quorum, and in particular cases, if not in all, more than a
majority of a quorum for a decision,” asserted that such requirements would be in-
consistent with majority rule, which is “the fundamental principle of free govern-
ment”); id., No. 22, p. 138–39 (Hamilton observed that “equal suffrage among the
States under the Articles of Confederation contradicts that fundamental maxim of
republican government which requires that the sense of the majority should pre-
vail”).
