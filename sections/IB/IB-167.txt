    Thus, the Court applied the federal arson statute to the at-
tempted “torching” of a defendant’s two-unit apartment building. The
Court merely pointed to the fact that the rental of real estate “un-
questionably” affects interstate commerce and that “the local rental
of an apartment unit is merely an element of a much broader com-
mercial market in real estate.” 899 The apparent test of whether ag-
gregation of local activity can be said to affect commerce was made
clear next in an antitrust context.900
     In a case allowing the continuation of an antitrust suit challeng-
ing a hospital’s exclusion of a surgeon from practice in the hospi-
tal, the Court observed that in order to establish the required juris-
dictional nexus with commerce, the appropriate focus is not on the
actual effects of the conspiracy but instead is on the possible conse-
quences for the affected market if the conspiracy is successful. The
required nexus in this case was sufficient because competitive sig-
nificance is to be measured by a general evaluation of the impact
of the restraint on other participants and potential participants in
the market from which the surgeon was being excluded.901
    Requirement that Regulation be Economic.—In United States
v. Lopez 902 the Court, for the first time in almost sixty years,903
invalidated a federal law as exceeding Congress’s authority under
the Commerce Clause. The statute made it a federal offense to pos-
sess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school.904 The Court reviewed
the doctrinal development of the Commerce Clause, especially the
effects and aggregation tests, and reaffirmed that it is the Court’s
responsibility to decide whether a rational basis exists for conclud-
ing that a regulated activity sufficiently affects interstate com-
merce when a law is challenged.905 As noted previously, the Court
evaluation started with a consideration of whether the legislation

    899 Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858, 862 (1985). In a later case the Court

avoided the constitutional issue by holding the statute inapplicable to the arson of
an owner-occupied private residence.
    900 Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S. 322 (1991). See also Jones v. United

States, 529 U.S. 848 (2000) (an owner-occupied building is not “used” in interstate
commerce within the meaning of the federal arson statute).
    901 500 U.S. at 330–32. The decision was 5-to-4, with the dissenters of the view

that, although Congress could reach the activity, it had not done so.
    902 514 U.S. 549 (1995). The Court was divided 5-to-4, with Chief Justice Rehnquist

writing the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and
Thomas, with dissents by Justices Stevens, Souter, Breyer, and Ginsburg.

mining industry as outside of Commerce Clause).
    904 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A). Congress subsequently amended the section to make

the offense jurisdictionally to turn on possession of “a firearm that has moved in or
that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce.” Pub. L. 104–208, 110 Stat.
