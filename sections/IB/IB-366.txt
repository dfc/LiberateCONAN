ter having been granted imports consideration from the point of view
of the state.2105 With this doctrine before it, the Court in Provi-
dence Bank v. Billings,2106 and again in Charles River Bridge v. War-
ren Bridge,2107 admitted, without discussion of the point, the appli-
cability of the Dartmouth College decision to purely business concerns.
    Reservation of Right to Alter or Repeal Corporate Char-
ters.—There are four principles or doctrines by which the Court has
broken down the force of the Dartmouth College decision in great
measure in favor of state legislative power. By the logic of Dartmouth
College itself, the state may reserve in a corporate charter the right
to “amend, alter, and repeal” the same, and such reservation be-
comes a part of the contract between the state and the incorpora-
tors, the obligation of which is accordingly not impaired by the ex-
ercise of the right.2108 Later decisions recognize that the state may
reserve the right to amend, alter, and repeal by general law, with
the result of incorporating the reservation in all charters of subse-
quent date.2109 There is, however, a difference between a reserva-
tion by a statute and one by constitutional provision. Although the
former may be repealed as to a subsequent charter by the specific
terms thereof, the latter may not.2110
    Is the right reserved by a state to “amend” or “alter” a charter
without restriction? When it is accompanied, as it generally is, by
the right to “repeal,” one would suppose that the answer to this
question was self-evident. Nonetheless, there is judicial dicta to the
effect that this power is not without limit, that it must be exer-
cised reasonably and in good faith, and that the alterations made
must be consistent with the scope and object of the grant.2111 Yet,
