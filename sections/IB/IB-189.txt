on some local, rather than an interstate, activity or if the tax was
exacted before interstate movement had begun or after it had ended.
     An independent basis for invalidation was that the tax was dis-
criminatory, that its impact was intentionally or unintentionally felt
by interstate commerce and not by local, perhaps in pursuit of pa-
rochial interests. Many of the early cases actually involving discrimi-
natory taxation were decided on the basis of the impermissibility
of taxing interstate commerce at all, but the category was soon clearly
delineated as a separate ground (and one of the most important to-
day).1017
     Following the Great Depression and under the leadership of Jus-
tice, and later Chief Justice, Stone, the Court attempted to move
away from the principle that interstate commerce may not be taxed
and reliance on the direct-indirect distinction. Instead, a state or
local levy would be voided only if in the opinion of the Court it cre-
ated a risk of multiple taxation for interstate commerce not felt by
local commerce.1018 It became much more important to the validity
of a tax that it be apportioned to an interstate company’s activities
within the taxing state, so as to reduce the risk of multiple taxa-
tion.1019 But, just as the Court had achieved constancy in the area
of regulation, it reverted to the older doctrines in the taxation area
and reiterated that interstate commerce may not be taxed at all,
even by a properly apportioned levy, and reasserted the direct-
indirect distinction.1020 The stage was set, following a series of cases
in which through formalistic reasoning the states were permitted
to evade the Court’s precedents,1021 for the formulation of a more
realistic doctrine.

     1017 E.g., Welton v. Missouri, 91 U.S. 275 (1875); Robbins v. Shelby County Tax-

ing District, 120 U.S. 489 (1887); Darnell & Son Co. v. City of Memphis, 208 U.S.
113 (1908); Bethlehem Motors Co. v. Flynt, 256 U.S. 421 (1921).
     1018 Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. 250 (1938); McGoldrick

v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309 U.S. 33 (1940); International Harvester Co.
v. Department of Treasury, 322 U.S. 340 (1944); International Harvester Co. v. Evatt,
329 U.S. 416 (1947).
     1019 E.g., Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434 (1939); Joseph

v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U.S. 422 (1947); Central Greyhound Lines
v. Mealey, 334 U.S. 653 (1948). Notice the Court’s distinguishing of Central Grey-
hound in Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines, 514 U.S. 175, 188–91 (1995).
     1020 Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U.S. 249 (1946); Spector Motor Serv. v. O’Connor,

340 U.S. 602 (1951).
     1021 Thus, the states carefully phrased tax laws so as to impose on interstate

companies not a license tax for doing business in the state, which was not permit-
ted, Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, 347 U.S. 359 (1954), but as a franchise tax
on intangible property or the privilege of doing business in a corporate form, which
was permissible. Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, 358 U.S. 434 (1959); Colonial
Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U.S. 100 (1975). Also, the Court increasingly found the
tax to be imposed on a local activity in instances it would previously have seen to
