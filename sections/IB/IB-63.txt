gress by statute either to create property qualifications or to create
additional qualifications without limitation,331 and because both Ham-
ilton and Madison in the Federalist Papers and Hamilton in the
New York ratifying convention had strongly urged that the Consti-
tution prescribed exclusive qualifications for Members of Con-
gress.332
     Further, the Court observed that the early practice of Con-
gress, with many of the Framers serving, was consistently limited
to the view that exclusion could be exercised only with regard to a
Member-elect failing to meet a qualification expressly prescribed in
the Constitution. Not until the Civil War did contrary precedents
appear, and later practice was mixed.333 Finally, even were the in-
tent of the Framers less clear, said the Court, it would still be com-
pelled to interpret the power to exclude narrowly. “A fundamental
principle of our representative democracy is, in Hamilton’s words,
‘that the people should choose whom they please to govern them.’ 2
Elliot’s Debates 257. As Madison pointed out at the Convention, this
principle is undermined as much by limiting whom the people can
select as by limiting the franchise itself. In apparent agreement with
this basic philosophy, the Convention adopted his suggestion limit-
ing the power to expel. To allow essentially that same power to be
exercised under the guise of judging qualifications, would be to ig-
nore Madison’s warning, borne out in the Wilkes case and some of
Congress’s own post-Civil War exclusion cases, against ‘vesting an
improper and dangerous power in the Legislature.’ 2 Farrand 249.” 334
Thus, the Court appears to say, to allow the House to exclude Pow-
ell on this basis of qualifications of its own choosing would impinge
on the interests of his constituents in effective participation in the
electoral process, an interest which could be protected by a narrow
interpretation of Congressional power.335
    The result in Powell had been foreshadowed when the Court
held that the exclusion of a Member-elect by a state legislature be-
cause of objections he had uttered to certain national policies con-

    331  395 U.S. at 532–39.
    332  395 U.S. at 539–41.
     333 395 U.S. at 541–47.
     334 395 U.S. at 547–48.
     335 The protection of the voters’ interest in being represented by the person of

their choice is thus analogized to their constitutionally secured right to cast a ballot
and have it counted in general elections, Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 (1884),
and in primary elections, United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941), to cast a
ballot undiluted in strength because of unequally populated districts, Wesberry v.
Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), and to cast a vote for candidates of their choice unfet-
tered by onerous restrictions on candidate qualification for the ballot. Williams v.
Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968).
