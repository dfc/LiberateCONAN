ance companies or insurance contracts.1170 Interpretation of the pro-
visions has resulted in contentious and divided Court opinions.1171
    Also illustrative of the judicial difficulty with ambiguous pre-
emption language are the fractured opinions in Cipollone, in which
the Court had to decide whether sections of the Federal Cigarette
Labeling and Advertising Act, enacted in 1965 and 1969, pre-
empted state common-law actions against a cigarette company for
the alleged harm visited on a smoker.1172 The 1965 provision barred

this section as a “virtually unique pre-emption provision.” Franchise Tax Bd. v. Con-
struction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 24 n.26 (1983). See Ingersoll-Rand
Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 138–139 (1990); see also id. at 142–45 (describing
and applying another preemption provision of ERISA).

eral health-insurance policy or employee health-care plan is a law “which regulates
insurance” and is not preempted); Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, 463 U.S. 85 (1983) (state

     1172 Cipollone v. Liggett Group, 505 U.S. 504 (1992). The decision relied on two

controversial rules of construction. First, the courts should interpret narrowly provi-
sions that purport to preempt state police-power regulations, and, second, that when
a law has express preemption language courts should look only to that language
and presume that when the preemptive reach of a law is defined Congress did not
