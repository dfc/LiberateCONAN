    Among the Several States.—Continuing in Gibbons v. Ogden,
Chief Justice Marshall observed that the phrase “among the sev-
eral States” was “not one which would probably have been selected
to indicate the completely interior traffic of a state.” It must there-
fore have been selected to exclude “the exclusively internal com-
merce of a state.” Although, of course, the phrase “may very prop-
erly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more states than
one,” it is obvious that “[c]ommerce among the states, cannot stop
at the external boundary line of each state, but may be introduced
into the interior.” The Chief Justice then succinctly stated the rule,
which, though restricted in some periods, continues to govern the
interpretation of the clause. “The genius and character of the whole
government seem to be, that its action is to be applied to all the
external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which
affect the states generally; but not to those which are completely
within a particular state, which do not affect other states, and with
which it is not necessary to interfere, for the purpose of executing
some of the general powers of the government.” 678
     Recognition of an “exclusively internal” commerce of a state, or
“intrastate commerce” in today’s terms, was regarded as setting out
an area of state concern that Congress was precluded from reach-
ing.679 Although these cases seemingly visualized Congress’s power
arising only when there was an actual crossing of state boundar-
ies, this view ignored Marshall’s equation of intrastate commerce
that affects other states or with which it is necessary to interfere
in order to effectuate congressional power with those actions which
are purely interstate. This equation came back into its own, both
with the Court’s stress on the “current of commerce” bringing each
element in the current within Congress’s regulatory power,680 with
the emphasis on the interrelationships of industrial production to
interstate commerce 681 but especially with the emphasis that even
