with the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, an area sub-
ject to such jurisdiction may be annexed by a municipality.1807

Duration of Federal Jurisdiction
    A state may qualify its cession of territory by a condition that
jurisdiction shall be retained by the United States only so long as
the place is used for specified purposes.1808 Such a provision oper-
ates prospectively and does not except from the grant that portion
of a described tract which is then used as a railroad right of way.1809
In 1892, the Court upheld the jurisdiction of the United States to
try a person charged with murder on a military reservation, over
the objection that the state had ceded jurisdiction only over such
portions of the area as were used for military purposes and that
the particular place on which the murder was committed was used
solely for farming. The Court held that the character and purpose
of the occupation having been officially established by the political
department of the government, it was not open to the Court to in-
quire into the actual uses to which any portion of the area was tem-
porarily put.1810 A few years later, however, it ruled that the lease
to a city, for use as a market, of a portion of an area which had
been ceded to the United States for a particular purpose, sus-
pended the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.1811
    The question arose whether the United States retains jurisdic-
tion over a place that was ceded to it unconditionally, after it has
abandoned the use of the property for governmental purposes and
entered into a contract for sale to private persons. Minnesota as-
serted the right to tax the equitable interest of the purchaser in
such land, and the Supreme Court upheld its right to do so. The
majority assumed that “the Government’s unrestricted transfer of
property to nonfederal hands is a relinquishment of the exclusive
legislative power.” 1812 In separate concurring opinions, Chief Jus-
tice Stone and Justice Frankfurter reserved judgment on the ques-
tion of territorial jurisdiction.1813

     1807 Howard v. Commissioners, 344 U.S. 624 (1953). As Howard recognized, such

areas of federal property do not cease to be part of the state in which they are lo-
cated and the residents of the areas are for most purposes residents of the state.
Thus, a state may not constitutionally exclude such residents from the privileges of
suffrage if they are otherwise qualified. Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419 (1970).
