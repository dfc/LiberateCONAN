cause of the importation, whether the title to the goods vested in
him at the time of shipment, or after its arrival in this country.2211
A state franchise tax measured by properly apportioned gross re-
ceipts may be imposed upon a railroad company in respect of the
companyâ€™s receipts for services in handling imports and exports at
its marine terminal.2212

Privilege Taxes
    A state law requiring importers to take out a license to sell im-
ported goods amounts to an indirect tax on imports and hence is
unconstitutional.2213 Likewise, a franchise tax upon foreign corpora-
tions engaged in importing nitrate and selling it in the original pack-
ages,2214 a tax on sales by brokers 2215 and auctioneers 2216 of im-
ported merchandise in original packages, and a tax on the sale of
goods in foreign commerce consisting of an annual license fee plus
a percentage of gross sales,2217 have been held invalid. On the other
hand, pilotage fees,2218 a tax upon the gross sales of a purchaser
from the importer,2219 a license tax upon dealing in fish which, through
processing, handling, and sale, have lost their distinctive character
as imports,2220 an annual license fee imposed on persons engaged
in buying and selling foreign bills of exchange,2221 and a tax upon
the right of an alien to receive property as heir, legatee, or donee
of a deceased person 2222 have been held not to be duties on im-
ports or exports.

Property Taxes
    Overruling a line of prior decisions that it thought misinter-
preted the language of Brown v. Maryland, the Court now holds
that the clause does not prevent a state from levying a nondiscrimi-
natory, ad valorem property tax upon goods that are no longer in
