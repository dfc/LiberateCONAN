an exercise at large by providing the courts with some measure against
which to judge the official action that has been challenged.” 105
    The only two instances in which the Court has found an uncon-
stitutional delegation to a public entity have involved grants of dis-
cretion that the Court found to be unbounded, hence standardless.
Thus, in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan,106 the President was autho-
rized to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce of “hot oil”—
oil produced in excess of state quotas. Nowhere—not in the lan-
guage conferring the authority, nor in the “declaration of policy,”
nor in any other provision—did the statute specify a policy to guide
the President in determining when and under what circumstances
to exercise the power.107 Although the scope of granted authority in
Panama Refining was narrow, the grant in A. L. A. Schechter Poul-
try Corp. v. United States 108 was sweeping. The National Indus-
trial Recovery Act devolved on the executive branch the power to
formulate codes of “fair competition” for all industry in order to pro-
mote “the policy of this title.” The policy was “to eliminate unfair
competitive practices, to promote the fullest possible utilization of
the present productive capacity of industries, . . . and otherwise to
rehabilitate industry. . . .” 109 Though much of the opinion is writ-
ten in terms of the failure of these policy statements to provide mean-
ingful standards, the Court was also concerned with the delega-
tion’s vast scope—the “virtually unfettered” discretion conferred on
the President of “enacting laws for the government of trade and in-
dustry throughout the country.” 110

    105  Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 626 (1963) (Justice Harlan, dissenting).
    106  293 U.S. 388 (1935).
     107 The Court, in the view of many observers, was influenced heavily by the fact

that the President’s orders were nowhere published and notice of regulations bear-
ing criminal penalties for their violations was spotty at best. Cf. E. CORWIN, THE PRESI-
DENT: OFFICE AND POWERS 1787–1957 394–95 (4th ed. 1958). The result of the Govern-
ment’s discomfiture in Court was enactment of the Federal Register Act, 49 Stat.
500 (1935), 44 U.S.C. § 301, providing for publication of Executive Orders and agency
regulations in the daily Federal Register.
     108 295 U.S. 495 (1935).
     109 48 Stat. 195 (1933), Tit. I, § 1.
     110 295 U.S. at 542. A delegation of narrower scope led to a different result in

Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 250 (1947), the Court finding explicit standards
unnecessary because “[t]he provisions are regulatory” and deal with but one enter-
prise, banking, the problems of which are well known and the authorized remedies
as equally well known. “A discretion to make regulations to guide supervisory ac-
tion in such matters may be constitutionally permissible while it might not be allow-
able to authorize creation of new crimes in uncharted fields.” The Court has re-
cently explained that “the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according
to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.” Whitman v. American Trucking
Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001) (Congress need not provide “any direction” to EPA
in defining “country elevators,” but “must provide substantial guidance on setting
air standards that affect the entire national economy”).
