on the gross receipts derived therefrom” was held to preempt a state
tax on airlines, described by the state as a personal property tax,
but based on a percentage of the airline’s gross income. “The man-
ner in which the state legislature has described and categorized [the
tax] cannot mask the fact that the purpose and effect of the provi-
sion are to impose a levy upon the gross receipts of airlines.” 1160
     But, more often than not, express preemptive language may be
ambiguous or at least not free from conflicting interpretation. Thus,
the Court was divided with respect to whether a provision of the
Airline Deregulation Act proscribing the states from having and en-
forcing laws “relating to rates, routes, or services of any air car-
rier” applied to displace state consumer-protection laws regulating
airline fare advertising.1161 Delimiting the scope of an exception in
an express preemption provision can also present challenges. For
example, the Immigration Control and Reform Act of 1986 (IRCA),
which imposed the first comprehensive federal sanctions against em-
ploying aliens not authorized to work in the United States, pre-
empted “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions
(other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who em-
ploy unauthorized aliens.” 1162 In Chamber of Commerce of the United
States v. Whiting, a majority of the Court adopted a straightfor-
ward “plain meaning” approach to uphold a 2007 Arizona law that
called for the suspension or revocation of the business licenses (in-
cluding articles of incorporation and like documents) of Arizona em-
ployers found to have knowingly hired an unauthorized alien.1163
By contrast, two dissenting opinions were troubled that the Ari-
zona sanction was far more severe than that authorized for similar
violations under either federal law or state laws in force prior to
IRCA. The dissents interpreted IRCA’s “licensing and similar laws”
language narrowly to cover only businesses that primarily recruit
