    The Court applied the “original package” doctrine to interstate
commerce in intoxicants, which the Court denominated “legitimate
articles of commerce.” 984 Although it held that a state was entitled
to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicants within its bound-
aries,985 it contemporaneously laid down the rule, in Bowman v. Chi-
cago & Northwestern Ry. Co.,986 that, so long as Congress re-
mained silent in the matter, a state lacked the power, even as part
and parcel of a program of statewide prohibition of the traffic in
intoxicants, to prevent the importation of liquor from a sister state.
This holding was soon followed by another to the effect that, so long
as Congress remained silent, a state had no power to prevent the
sale in the original package of liquors introduced from another state.987
Congress soon attempted to overcome the effect of the latter deci-
sion by enacting the Wilson Act,988 which empowered states to regu-
late imported liquor on the same terms as domestically produced
liquor, but the Court interpreted the law narrowly as subjecting im-
ported liquor to local authority only after its resale.989 Congress did
not fully nullify the Bowman case until 1913, when enactment of
the Webb-Kenyon Act 990 clearly authorized states to regulate di-
rect shipments for personal use.
     National Prohibition, imposed by the Eighteenth Amendment,
temporarily mooted these conflicts, but they reemerged with repeal
of Prohibition by the Twenty-first Amendment. Section 2 of the Twenty-
first Amendment prohibits “the importation into any State . . . for
delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the
laws thereof.” Initially the Court interpreted this language to au-
thorize states to discriminate against imported liquor in favor of
that produced in-state, but the modern Court has rejected this in-

     984 The Court had developed the “original package” doctrine to restrict applica-

tion of a state tax on imports from a foreign country in Brown v. Maryland, 25 U.S.
(12 Wheat.) 419, 449 (1827). Although Chief Justice Marshall had indicated in dic-
tum in Brown that the same rule would apply to imports from sister states, the
Court had refused to follow that dictum in Woodruff v. Parham, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.)
123 (1869).
     985 Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887). Relying on the distinction between

manufacture and commerce, the Court soon applied this ruling to authorize states
to prohibit manufacture of liquor for an out-of-state market. Kidd v. Pearson, 128
U.S. 1 (1888).
     986 125 U.S. 465 (1888).
     987 Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100 (1890).
     988 Ch. 728, 26 Stat. 313 (1890), upheld in In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545 (1891).
     989 Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U.S. 412 (1898).
     990 Ch. 90, 37 Stat. 699 (1913), sustained in Clark-Distilling Co. v. Western Md.

Ry., 242 U.S. 311 (1917). See also Department of Revenue v. Beam Distillers, 377
U.S. 341 (1964).
