gency, leave or remain outside the country in order to evade mili-
tary service. 1350 And, in the following year, the Court held
unconstitutional a section of the law that expatriated a naturalized
citizen who returned to his native land and resided there continu-
ously for a period of three years.1351
     The cases up to this point had lacked a common rationale and
would have seemed to permit even punitive expatriation under the
proper circumstances. But, in Afroyim v. Rusk,1352 a five-to-four ma-
jority overruled the 1958 decision permitting expatriation for vot-
ing in a foreign election and announced a constitutional rule against
all but purely voluntary renunciation of United States citizenship.
The majority ruled that the first sentence of § 1 of the Fourteenth
Amendment constitutionally vested citizenship in every person “born
or naturalized in the United States” and that Congress was power-
less to take that citizenship away.1353 The continuing vitality of this
decision was called into question by another five-to-four decision in
1971, which technically distinguished Afroyim in upholding a con-
gressionally prescribed loss of citizenship visited upon a person who
was statutorily naturalized “outside” the United States, and held
not within the protection of the first sentence of § 1 of the Four-
teenth Amendment.1354 Thus, although Afroyim was distinguished,
the tenor of the majority opinion was hostile to its holding, and it
may be that a future case will overrule it.
    The issue, then, of the constitutionality of congressionally pre-
scribed expatriation is unsettled.

     1350 Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963). For the Court Justice

Goldberg held that penal expatriation effectuated solely by administrative determi-
nation violated due process because of the absence of procedural safeguards. Jus-
tices Black and Douglas continued to insist Congress could not deprive a citizen of
his nationality at all. Justice Harlan for the dissenters thought the statute a valid
exercise of Congress’s war powers but the four dissenters divided two-to-two on the
validity of a presumption spelled out in the statute.
     1351 Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964).
     1352 387 U.S. 253 (1967).
     1353 Justice Harlan, for himself and Justices Clark, Stewart, and White, argued

in dissent that there was no evidence that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment had at all the intention ascribed to them by the majority. He would have found
in Afroyim’s voluntary act of voting in a foreign election a voluntary renunciation of
United States citizenship. 387 U.S. at 268.
     1354 Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971). The three remaining Afroyim dissent-

ers plus Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun made up the majority, the three
remaining Justices of the Afroyim majority plus Justice Marshall made up the dis-
senters. The continuing vitality of Afroyim was assumed in Vance v. Terrazas, 444
U.S. 252 (1980), in which a divided Court upheld a congressionally imposed stan-
dard of proof, preponderance of evidence, by which to determine whether one had
by his actions renounced his citizenship.
