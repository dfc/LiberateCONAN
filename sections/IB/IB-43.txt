to imprison the contumacious witness.200 Notwithstanding this firmly
established legislative practice, the Supreme Court took a narrow
view of the power in Kilbourn v. Thompson.201 It held that the House
of Representatives had overstepped its jurisdiction when it insti-
tuted an investigation of losses suffered by the United States as a
creditor of Jay Cooke and Company, whose estate was being admin-
istered in bankruptcy by a federal court.202 But nearly half a cen-
tury later, in McGrain v. Daugherty,203 it ratified in sweeping terms,
the power of Congress to inquire into the administration of an ex-
ecutive department and to sift charges of malfeasance in such ad-
ministration.204

Investigations of Members of Congress
     When either House exercises a judicial function, as in judging
of elections or determining whether a member should be expelled,
it is clearly entitled to compel the attendance of witnesses to dis-
close the facts upon which its action must be based. Thus, the Court
held that since a House had a right to expel a member for any of-
fense which it deemed incompatible with his trust and duty as a
member, it was entitled to investigate such conduct and to sum-
mon private individuals to give testimony concerning it.205 The de-
cision in Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham 206 sanctioned
the exercise of a similar power in investigating a senatorial elec-
tion.

Investigations in Aid of Legislation
    Purpose.—Beginning with a resolution adopted by the House
of Representatives in 1827, which vested its Committee on Manu-
factures “with the power to send for persons and papers with a view
to ascertain and report to this House in relation to a revision of
    200  CONG. GLOBE, 36th Congress, 1st sess., 1100–1109 (1860).
    201  103 U.S. 168 (1881).
     202 The Court held that inasmuch as the entire proceedings arising out of the

bankruptcy were pending in court, as the authorizing resolution contained no sug-
gestion of contemplated legislation, as in fact no valid legislation could be enacted
on the subject, and as the only relief which the United States could seek was judi-
cial relief in the bankruptcy proceeding, the House had exceeded its powers in au-
thorizing the inquiry. But see Hutcheson v. United States, 369 U.S. 599 (1962).
     203 273 U.S. 135, 177, 178 (1927).
     204 The topic of executive privilege, the claimed right of the President and at

least some of his executive branch officers to withhold from Congress information
desired by it or by one of its committees, is addressed in Article II, The Presidential
Aegis: Demands for Papers. Although the issue has been one of contention between
the two branches of Government since Washington’s refusal in 1796 to submit cer-
tain correspondence to the House of Representatives relating to treaty negotiations,
it has only relatively recently become a judicial issue.
     205 In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661 (1897).
     206 279 U.S. 597 (1929).
