of sovereignty guaranteed them by the Constitution.” 560 In a later
case dealing with state immunity the Court sustained the tax on
the second ground mentioned in Helvering v. Gerhardt—that the
burden of the tax was borne by private persons—and did not con-
sider whether the function was one which the Federal Government
might have taxed if the municipality had borne the burden of the
exaction.561
    Articulation of the current approach may be found in South Caro-
lina v. Baker.562 The rules are “essentially the same” for federal im-
munity from state taxation and for state immunity from federal taxa-
tion, except that some state activities may be subject to direct federal
taxation, while states may “never” tax the United States directly.
Either government may tax private parties doing business with the
other government, “even though the financial burden falls on the
[other government], as long as the tax does not discriminate against
the [other government] or those with which it deals.” 563 Thus, “the
issue whether a nondiscriminatory federal tax might nonetheless
violate state tax immunity does not even arise unless the Federal
Government seeks to collect the tax directly from a State.” 564
    Uniformity Requirement.—Whether a tax is to be appor-
tioned among the states according to the census taken pursuant to
Article I, § 2, or imposed uniformly throughout the United States
depends upon its classification as direct or indirect.565 The rule of
uniformity for indirect taxes is easy to obey. It requires only that
the subject matter of a levy be taxed at the same rate wherever
found in the United States; or, as it is sometimes phrased, the uni-
formity required is “geographical,” not “intrinsic.” 566 Even the geo-
graphical limitation is a loose one, at least if one follows United
States v. Ptasynski,567 in which the Court upheld an exemption from
a crude-oil windfall-profits tax of “Alaskan oil,” defined geographi-
cally to include oil produced in Alaska (or elsewhere) north of the
Arctic Circle. What is prohibited, the Court said, is favoritism to
particular states in the absence of valid bases of classification. Be-
cause Congress could have achieved the same result, allowing for
severe climactic difficulties, through a classification tailored to the
“disproportionate costs and difficulties . . . associated with extract-
