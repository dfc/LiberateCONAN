coercive as to pass the point at which “pressure turns into compul-
sion.” 632 Certain federalism restraints on other federal powers seem
not to be relevant to spending conditions.633
     In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (ACA),634 which established a comprehensive health care
system for the United States. As part of this new system, the Act
expanded which persons were eligible for Medicaid, which is fi-
nanced jointly by the federal and state governments. Failure of a
state to implement such expansion could, in theory, have resulted
in the withholding of all Medicaid reimbursements, including pay-
ments for persons previously covered by the Medicaid program. In
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) v. Sebelius,635
seven Justices (in two separate opinions) held that the require-
ment that states either comply with the requirements of the Medic-
aid expansion under the ACA or lose all Medicaid funds violated
the Tenth Amendment.636 The Court held, however, that withhold-
ing of just the funds associated with that expansion raised no sig-
nificant constitutional concerns, essentially making the Medicaid ex-
pansion voluntary.
     Chief Justice Roberts’ controlling opinion 637 in NFIB held that
the ACA Medicaid expansion created a “new” and “independent” pro-
gram.638 As Congress’s power to direct state activities under the Spend-

ered to achieve directly”).

     636 Chief Justice Robert’s opinion was joined by Justices Breyer and Kagan on

this point, while Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito made a similar point
in a joint dissenting opinion. The authoring Justices of the two opinions, however,
did not join in either the reasoning or judgment of the other opinion.
     637 “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining

the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed
as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the
narrowest grounds.’ ” Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (citation omit-
ted). Justice Roberts opinion is arguably narrower than the dissent, because, as dis-
cussed below, his opinion found a constitutional violation based on the presence of
both a “new” “independent” program and a coercive loss of funds, while the dissent-
ing opinion would have found the coercive loss of funds sufficient. NFIB, 567 U.S.

ion, with its emphasis on “new” and “independent” programs, is implicitly address-
ing the “relatedness” inquiry of South Dakota v. Dole. Justice Roberts’ opinion, how-
ever, does not explicitly discuss the issue, and an argument can be made that there
is a significant difference between the two inquiries. As noted, the “relatedness in-
quiry” in Dole was identified as a limitation on the Spending Clause, while the NFIB
