ties are free to disregard the Constitution when acting in this area,1628
the Court nonetheless operates with “a healthy deference to legisla-
tive and executive judgments” about military affairs,1629 so that, while
constitutional guarantees apply, “the different character of the mili-
tary community and of the military mission requires a different ap-
plication of those protections.” 1630
     In reliance upon this deference to congressional judgment about
the roles of the sexes in combat and the necessities of military mo-
bilization, coupled with express congressional consideration of the
precise questions, the Court sustained as constitutional the legisla-
tive judgment to provide for registration of males only for possible
future conscription.1631 Emphasizing the unique, separate status of
the military, the necessity to indoctrinate men in obedience and dis-
cipline, the tradition of military neutrality in political affairs, and
the need to protect troop morale, the Court upheld the validity of
military post regulations, backed by congressional enactments, ban-
ning speeches and demonstrations of a partisan political nature and
the distribution of literature without prior approval of post head-
quarters, with the commander authorized to keep out only those
materials that would clearly endanger the loyalty, discipline, or mo-
rale of troops on the base.1632 On the same basis, the Court re-
jected challenges on constitutional and statutory grounds to mili-
tary regulations requiring servicemen to obtain approval from their
commanders before circulating petitions on base, in the context of
circulations of petitions for presentation to Congress.1633 And the
statements of a military officer urging disobedience to certain or-
ders could be punished under provisions that would have been of
questionable validity in a civilian context.1634 Reciting the consider-
