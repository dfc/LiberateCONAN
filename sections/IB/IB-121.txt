selling, or the interchange of commodities, and do not admit that it
comprehends navigation. This would restrict a general term, appli-
cable to many objects, to one of its significations. Commerce, un-
doubtedly, is traffic, but it is something more—it is intercourse.” 660
The term, therefore, included navigation, a conclusion that Mar-
shall also supported by appeal to general understanding, to the pro-
hibition in Article I, § 9, against any preference being given “by any
regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one State over
those of another,” and to the admitted and demonstrated power of
Congress to impose embargoes.661
     Marshall qualified the word “intercourse” with the word “com-
mercial,” thus retaining the element of monetary transactions.662
But, today, “commerce” in the constitutional sense, and hence “in-
terstate commerce,” covers every species of movement of persons and
things, whether for profit or not, across state lines,663 every species
of communication, every species of transmission of intelligence, whether
for commercial purposes or otherwise,664 every species of commer-
cial negotiation that will involve sooner or later an act of transpor-
tation of persons or things, or the flow of services or power, across
state lines.665
    There was a long period in the Court’s history when a majority
of the Justices, seeking to curb the regulatory powers of the Fed-
eral Government by various means, held that certain things were
not encompassed by the Commerce Clause because they were nei-
ther interstate commerce nor bore a sufficient nexus to interstate
commerce. Thus, at one time, the Court held that mining or manu-
facturing, even when the product would move in interstate com-
merce, was not reachable under the Commerce Clause; 666 it held
insurance transactions carried on across state lines not to be com-

     662 22 U.S. at 193.
     663 As we will see, however, in many later formulations the crossing of state

lines is no longer the sine qua non; wholly intrastate transactions with substantial
effects on interstate commerce may suffice.

may be commerce though illegal and sporadic, and though they do not utilize com-
mon carriers or concern the flow of anything more tangible than electrons and infor-
mation.” United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass’n, 322 U.S. 533, 549–50
