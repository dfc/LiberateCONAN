tween its two principal authors. Hamilton adopted the literal, broad
meaning of the clause; 601 Madison contended that the powers of taxa-
tion and appropriation of the proposed government should be re-
garded as merely instrumental to its remaining powers; in other
words, as little more than a power of self-support.602 From early
times, Congress has acted upon Hamilton’s interpretation. Appro-
priations for subsidies 603 and for an ever-increasing variety of “in-
ternal improvements” 604 constructed by the Federal Government,
had their beginnings in the administrations of Washington and Jef-
ferson.605 Since 1914, federal grants-in-aid, which are sums of money
apportioned among the states for particular uses, often conditioned
upon the duplication of the sums by the recipient state, and upon
observance of stipulated restrictions as to their use, have become
commonplace.
    The scope of the national spending power came before the Su-
preme Court at least five times prior to 1936, but the Court dis-
posed of four of the suits without construing the “general welfare”
clause. In the Pacific Railway Cases 606 and Smith v. Kansas City
Title & Trust Co.,607 it affirmed the power of Congress to construct
internal improvements, and to charter and purchase the capital stock
of federal land banks, by reference to its powers over commerce,
post roads, and fiscal operations, and to its war powers. Decisions
on the merits were withheld in two other cases, Massachusetts v.
Mellon and Frothingham v. Mellon,608 on the ground that neither a
state nor an individual citizen is entitled to a remedy in the courts
against an alleged unconstitutional appropriation of national funds.
In United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry.,609 however, the Court
invoked “the great power of taxation to be exercised for the com-

     605 In an advisory opinion, which it rendered for President Monroe at his re-

quest on the power of Congress to appropriate funds for public improvements, the
Court answered that such appropriations might be properly made under the war
and postal powers. See Albertsworth, Advisory Functions in the Supreme Court, 23
GEO. L. J. 643, 644–647 (1935). Monroe himself ultimately adopted the broadest view
of the spending power, from which, however, he carefully excluded any element of
regulatory or police power. See his Views of the President of the United States on the
Subject of Internal Improvements, of May 4, 1822, 2 MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESI-
DENTS 713–752 (Richardson ed., 1906).
