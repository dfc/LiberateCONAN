Power to Charter Corporations
    In addition to the creation of banks, Congress has been held to
have authority to charter a railroad corporation,1847 or a corpora-
tion to construct an interstate bridge,1848 as instrumentalities for
promoting commerce among the states, and to create corporations
to manufacture aircraft 1849 or merchant vessels 1850 as incidental to
the war power.

Courts and Judicial Proceedings
     Because the Constitution “delineated only the great outlines of
the judicial power . . . , leaving the details to Congress, . . . [t]he
distribution and appropriate exercise of the judicial power must . . .
be made by laws passed by Congress. . . .” 1851 As a necessary and
proper provision for the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by Ar-
ticle III, § 2, Congress may direct the removal from a state to a
federal court of a criminal prosecution against a federal officer for
acts done under color of federal law,1852 may require the tolling of
a state statute of limitations while a state cause of action that is
supplemental to a federal claim is pending in federal court,1853 and
may authorize the removal before trial of civil cases arising under
the laws of the United States.1854 It may prescribe the effect to be
given to judicial proceedings of the federal courts 1855 and may make
all laws necessary for carrying into execution the judgments of fed-
eral courts.1856 When a territory is admitted as a state, Congress
may designate the court to which the records of the territorial courts
shall be transferred and may prescribe the mode for enforcement
and review of judgments rendered by those courts.1857 In the exer-
cise of other powers conferred by the Constitution, apart from Ar-
ticle III, Congress may create legislative courts and “clothe them
with functions deemed essential or helpful in carrying those pow-
ers into execution.” 1858
