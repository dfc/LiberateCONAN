ligan, Chief Justice Chase described the power to declare war as
“necessarily” extending “to all legislation essential to the prosecu-
tion of war with vigor and success, except such as interferes with
the command of the forces and conduct of campaigns.” 1576 In an-
other case, adopting the terminology used by Lincoln in his Mes-
sage to Congress on July 4, 1861,1577 the Court referred to “the war
power” as a single unified power.1578
     An Inherent Power.—Thereafter, we find the phrase, “the war
power,” being used by both Chief Justice White 1579 and Chief Jus-
tice Hughes,1580 the former declaring the power to be “complete and
undivided.” 1581 Not until 1936, however, did the Court explain the
logical basis for imputing such an inherent power to the Federal
Government. In United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp.,1582 the rea-
sons for this conclusion were stated by Justice Sutherland as fol-
lows: “As a result of the separation from Great Britain by the colo-
nies acting as a unit, the powers of external sovereignty passed from
the Crown not to the colonies severally, but to the colonies in their
collective and corporate capacity as the United States of America.
Even before the Declaration, the colonies were a unit in foreign af-
fairs, acting through a common agency—namely, the Continental Con-
gress, composed of delegates from the thirteen colonies. That agency
exercised the powers of war and peace, raised an army, created a
navy, and finally adopted the Declaration of Independence. . . . It
results that the investment of the Federal Government with the pow-
ers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative grants
of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to con-
clude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with
other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the Con-
stitution, would have vested in the Federal Government as neces-
sary concomitants of nationality.” 1583
    A Complexus of Granted Powers.—In Lichter v. United
States,1584 on the other hand, the Court speaks of the “war powers”
of Congress. Upholding the Renegotiation Act, it declared that: “In
view of this power ‘To raise and support Armies, . . . and the power
