       each other, and, cemented by the necessary and proper clause, have
       provided a secure foundation for acts of Congress chartering banks
       and other financial institutions,1453 or making its treasury notes le-
       gal tender in the payment of antecedent debts.1454 But, in 1935, the
       opposite situation arose—one in which the power to regulate the
       value of money collided with the obligation incurred in the exercise
       of the power to borrow money. By a vote of eight-to-one the Su-
       preme Court held that the obligation assumed by the exercise of
       the latter was paramount, and could not be repudiated to effectu-
       ate the monetary policies of Congress.1455 In a concurring opinion,
       Justice Stone declined to join with the majority in suggesting that
       “the exercise of the sovereign power to borrow money on credit, which
       does not override the sovereign immunity from suit, may neverthe-
       less preclude or impede the exercise of another sovereign power, to
       regulate the value of money; or to suggest that although there is
       and can be no present cause of action upon the repudiated gold clause,
       its obligation is nevertheless, in some manner and to some extent,
       not stated, superior to the power to regulate the currency which
       we now hold to be superior to the obligation of the bonds.” 1456 How-
       ever, with a view to inducing purchase of savings bonds, the sale of
       which is essential to successful management of the national debt,
       Congress is competent to authorize issuance of regulations creating
       a right of survivorship in such bonds registered in co-ownership form,
       and such regulations preempt provisions of state law prohibiting
       married couples from using the survivorship privilege whenever bonds
       are paid out of community property.1457

    Clause 7. The Congress shall have Power * * * To establish
Post Offices and post roads.
                                     POSTAL POWER

       “Establish”
            The great question raised in the early days with reference to
       the postal clause concerned the meaning to be given to the word
       “establish”—did it confer upon Congress the power to construct post
       offices and post roads, or only the power to designate from existing
