cers, the argument was rejected as “too wanting in merit to require
further notice.” Congress continues to empower state officers to act.157
Presidents who have objected have done so not on delegation grounds,
but rather on the basis of the Appointments Clause.158
    The Court has upheld statutory delegations to private persons
in the form of contingency legislation. It has upheld, for example,
statutes providing that restrictions upon the production or market-
ing of agricultural commodities are to become operative only upon
a favorable vote by a prescribed majority of those persons af-
fected.159 The Court’s rationale has been that such a provision does
not involve any delegation of legislative authority, because Con-
gress has merely placed a restriction upon its own regulation by
withholding its operation unless it is approved in a referendum.160
    The Court has also upheld statutes that give private entities
actual regulatory power, rather than merely make regulation con-
tingent on such entities’ approval. The Court, for example, upheld
a statute that delegated to the American Railway Association, a trade
group, the authority to determine the standard height of draw bars
for freight cars and to certify the figure to the Interstate Com-
merce Commission, which was required to accept it.161 The Court
simply cited Buttfield v. Stranahan,162 in which it had sustained a
delegation to the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate mini-
mum standards of quality and purity for imported tea, as a case
“completely in point” and resolving the issue without need of fur-
ther consideration.163 Similarly, the Court had enforced statutes that
gave legal effect to local customs of miners with respect to claims
on public lands.164
    The Court has also struck down delegations to private entities,
but not solely because they were to private entities. In Schechter,

general may bring antitrust parens patriae actions); Medical Waste Tracking Act,
Pub. L. 100–582, 102 Stat. 2955, 42 U.S.C. § 6992f (states may impose civil and
possibly criminal penalties against violators of the law).

judicial challenge to such a practice resulted in a rebuff to the presidential argu-
