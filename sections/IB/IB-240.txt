explicitly announced an intention to pre-empt state activity.” 1260 A
corollary is that the preemption doctrine will not be applied strictly
to prevent states from aiding Native Americans.1261 However, the
protective rule is inapplicable to state regulation of liquor transac-
tions, because there has been no tradition of tribal sovereignty with
respect to that subject.1262
    The scope of state taxing powers—the conflict of “the plenary
power of the States over residents within their borders with the
semi-autonomous status of Indians living on tribal reservations” 1263—
has been often litigated. Absent cession of jurisdiction or other con-
gressional consent, states possess no power to tax Indian reserva-
tion lands or Indian income from activities carried on within the
boundaries of the reservation.1264 Off-reservation Indian activities
require an express federal exemption to deny state taxing power.1265
Subjection to taxation of non-Indians doing business with Indians
on the reservation involves a close analysis of the federal statutory
framework, although the operating premise was for many years to
deny state power because of its burdens upon the development of
tribal self-sufficiency as promoted through federal law and its inter-
ference with the tribes’ ability to exercise their sovereign func-
tions.1266
    That operating premise, however, seems to have been eroded.
For example, in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,1267 the Court
held that, despite of the existence of multiple taxation occasioned
by a state oil and gas severance tax applied to on-reservation opera-

state-court jurisdiction to hear claims of Native Americans against non-Indians in-
volving transactions that occurred in Indian country). However, attempts by states
to retrocede jurisdiction favorable to Native Americans may be held to be pre-
empted. Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold Engineering, 476 U.S. 877 (1986).

gressional cession is reflected in more recent cases. See County of Yakima v. Confed-
