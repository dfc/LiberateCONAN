the scope would be wide, but it extends to include many more pur-
poses than these. “Congress can certainly regulate interstate com-
merce to the extent of forbidding and punishing the use of such com-
merce as an agency to promote immorality, dishonesty, or the spread
of any evil or harm to the people of other states from the state of
origin. In doing this, it is merely exercising the police power, for
the benefit of the public, within the field of interstate com-
merce.” 686 Thus, in upholding a federal statute prohibiting the ship-
ment in interstate commerce of goods made with child labor, not
because the goods were intrinsically harmful but in order to extir-
pate child labor, the Court said: “It is no objection to the assertion
of the power to regulate commerce that its exercise is attended by
the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of
the states.” 687
     The power has been exercised to enforce majority conceptions
of morality,688 to ban racial discrimination in public accommoda-
tions,689 and to protect the public against evils both natural and
contrived by people.690 The power to regulate interstate commerce
is, therefore, rightly regarded as the most potent grant of authority
in section 8.
    Necessary and Proper Clause.—All grants of power to Con-
gress in § 8, as elsewhere, must be read in conjunction with the
Necessary and Proper Clause, § 8, cl. 18, which authorizes Con-
gress “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into Execution the foregoing powers.” Chief Justice Mar-
shall alluded to the power thus enhanced by this clause when he
said that the regulatory power did not extend “to those internal con-
cerns [of a state] . . . with which it is not necessary to interfere,
for the purpose of executing some of the general powers of the gov-
ernment.” 691 There are numerous cases permitting Congress to reach
“purely” intrastate activities on the theory, combined with the pre-
viously mentioned emphasis on the cumulative effect of minor trans-
actions, that it is necessary to regulate them in order that the regu-
