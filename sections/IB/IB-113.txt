     As with its other powers, Congress may enact legislation “nec-
essary and proper” to effectuate its purposes in taxing and spend-
ing. In upholding a law making it a crime to bribe state and local
officials who administer programs that receive federal funds, the Court
declared that Congress has authority “to see to it that taxpayer dol-
lars . . . are in fact spent for the general welfare, and not frittered
away in graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned
off or corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding value for
dollars.” 615 Congress’s failure to require proof of a direct connec-
tion between the bribery and the federal funds was permissible, the
Court concluded, because “corruption does not have to be that lim-
ited to affect the federal interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials
are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contrac-
tors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value.” 616
     Social Security Act Cases.—Although the Court in Butler held
that the spending power is not limited by the specific grants of power
contained in Article I, § 8, the Court found, nevertheless, that the
spending power was qualified by the Tenth Amendment, and on this
ground ruled that Congress could not use moneys raised by taxa-
tion to “purchase compliance” with regulations “of matters of state
concern with respect to which Congress has no authority to inter-
fere.” 617 Within little more than a year this decision was narrowed
by Steward Machine Co. v. Davis,618 which sustained the tax im-
posed on employers to provide unemployment benefits, and the credit
allowed for similar taxes paid to a state. To the argument that the
tax and credit in combination were “weapons of coercion, destroy-
ing or impairing the autonomy of the states,” the Court replied that
relief of unemployment was a legitimate object of federal expendi-
ture under the “general welfare” clause, that the Social Security Act
represented a legitimate attempt to solve the problem by the coop-
eration of state and Federal Governments, and that the credit al-
lowed for state taxes bore a reasonable relation “to the fiscal need

when spending the national revenues for the general welfare to see to it that the
country got its money’s worth, and that the challenged provisions served that end.
