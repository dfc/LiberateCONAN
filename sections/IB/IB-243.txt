       unique obligation toward the Indians . . . ” 1281 A more searching
       review is warranted when it is alleged that the Federal Govern-
       ment’s behavior toward the Indians has been in contravention of
       its obligation and that it has in fact taken property from a tribe
       which it had heretofore guaranteed to the tribe, without either com-
       pensating the tribe or otherwise giving the Indians the full value
       of the land.1282

    Clause 4. The Congress shall have Power * * * To establish
an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the sub-
ject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.

                       NATURALIZATION AND CITIZENSHIP

       Nature and Scope of Congress’s Power
            Naturalization has been defined by the Supreme Court as “the
       act of adopting a foreigner, and clothing him with the privileges of
       a native citizen.” 1283 In the Dred Scott case,1284 the Court asserted
       that the power of Congress under this clause applies only to “per-
       sons born in a foreign country, under a foreign Government.” 1285
       These dicta are much too narrow to describe the power that Con-
       gress has actually exercised on the subject. The competence of Con-
       gress in this field merges, in fact, with its indefinite, inherent pow-
       ers in the field of foreign relations. “As a government, the United
       States is invested with all the attributes of sovereignty. As it has
       the character of nationality it has the powers of nationality, espe-
       cially those which concern its relations and intercourse with other
       countries.” 1286
           Congress’s power over naturalization is an exclusive power; no
       state has the independent power to constitute a foreign subject a
           1281 Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 555 (1974). The Court applied the stan-

       dard to uphold a statutory classification that favored Indians over non-Indians. But
       in Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73 (1977), the same stan-
       dard was used to sustain a classification that disfavored, although inadvertently, one
       group of Indians as against other groups. While Indian tribes are unconstrained by
       federal or state constitutional provisions, Congress has legislated a “bill of rights”
       statute covering them. See Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49 (1978).
           1282 United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. 371 (1980). See also Solem v. Bartlett,

       465 U.S. 463, 472 (1984) (there must be “substantial and compelling evidence of con-
       gressional intention to diminish Indian lands” before the Court will hold that a stat-
       ute removed land from a reservation).
