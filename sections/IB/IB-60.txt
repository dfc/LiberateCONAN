       fications of congressional electors—has long been circumscribed by
       express constitutional limitations 306 and by judicial decisions.307 Fur-
       ther, beyond the limitation of discretion on the part of the states,
       Congress has assumed the power, with judicial acquiescence, to leg-
       islate to provide qualifications at least with regard to some elec-
       tions.308 Thus, in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 309 Congress legis-
       lated changes of a limited nature in the literacy laws of some of
       the States,310 and in the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 311
       Congress successfully lowered the minimum voting age in federal
       elections 312 and prescribed residency qualifications for presidential
       elections,313 the Court striking down an attempt to lower the mini-
       mum voting age for all elections.314 These developments greatly lim-
       ited the discretion granted in Article I, § 2, cl. 1, and are more fully
       dealt with in the treatment of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
            Notwithstanding the vesting of discretion to prescribe voting quali-
       fications in the states, conceptually the right to vote for United States
       Representatives is derived from the Federal Constitution,315 and Con-
       gress has had the power under Article I, § 4, to legislate to protect
       that right against both official 316 and private denial.317

    Clause 2. No person shall be a Representative who shall not
have attained to the Age of twenty-five Years, and been seven

            306 The Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth Amendments lim-

       ited the States in the setting of qualifications in terms of race, sex, payment of poll
       taxes, and age.
            307 The Supreme Court’s interpretation of the equal protection clause has ex-

       cluded certain qualifications. E.g., Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89 (1965); Kramer
       v. Union Free School Dist., 395 U.S. 621 (1969); City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399
       U.S. 204 (1970). The excluded qualifications were in regard to all elections.
            308 The power has been held to exist under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
