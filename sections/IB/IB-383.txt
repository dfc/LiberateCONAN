ready made,” said Justice Cardozo for the Court, “and moderate ex-
tensions of the time for pleading or for trial will ordinarily fall within
the power so reserved. A different situation is presented when ex-
tensions are so piled up as to make the remedy a shadow. . . . What
controls our judgment at such times is the underlying reality rather
than the form or label. The changes of remedy now challenged as
invalid are to be viewed in combination, with the cumulative signifi-
cance that each imparts to all. So viewed they are seen to be an
oppressive and unnecessary destruction of nearly all the incidents
that give attractiveness and value to collateral security.” 2190 On the
other hand, in the most recent of this category of cases, the Court
gave its approval to an extension by the State of New York of its
moratorium legislation. While recognizing that business conditions
had improved, the Court found reason to believe that “the sudden
termination of the legislation which has dammed up normal liqui-
dation of these mortgages for more than eight years might well re-
sult in an emergency more acute than that which the original leg-
islation was intended to alleviate.” 2191
     In the meantime, the Court had sustained New York State leg-
islation under which a mortgagee of real property was denied a de-
ficiency judgment in a foreclosure suit where the state court found
that the value of the property purchased by the mortgagee at the
foreclosure sale was equal to the debt secured by the mortgage.2192
“Mortgagees,” the Court said, “are constitutionally entitled to no more
than payment in full. . . . To hold that mortgagees are entitled un-
der the contract clause to retain the advantages of a forced sale
would be to dignify into a constitutionally protected property right
their chance to get more than the amount of their contracts. . . .
The contract clause does not protect such a strategical, procedural
advantage.” 2193
    More important, the Court has been at pains most recently to
reassert the vitality of the clause, although one may wonder whether
application of the clause will be more than episodic.
    “[T]he Contract Clause remains a part of our written Constitu-
tion.” 2194 So saying, the Court struck down state legislation in two

dead letter.” Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 241 (1978). A
majority of the Court seems fully committed to using the clause. Only Justices Bren-
nan, White, and Marshall dissented in both cases. Chief Justice Burger and Jus-
