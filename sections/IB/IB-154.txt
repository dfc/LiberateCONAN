to exercise powers not granted, and that the States might not be
able to exercise fully their reserved powers.” 829
     Subsequent decisions of the Court took a very broad view of which
employees should be covered by the Act,830 and in 1949 Congress
to some degree narrowed the permissible range of coverage and dis-
approved some of the Court’s decisions.831 But, in 1961,832 with ex-
tensions in 1966,833 Congress itself expanded by several million per-
sons the coverage of the Act, introducing the “enterprise” concept
by which all employees in a business producing anything in com-
merce or affecting commerce were brought within the protection of
the minimum wage-maximum hours standards.834 The “enterprise
concept” was sustained by the Court in Maryland v. Wirtz.835 Jus-
tice Harlan for a unanimous Court on this issue found the exten-
sion entirely proper on the basis of two theories: one, a business’
competitive position in commerce is determined in part by all its
significant labor costs, and not just those costs attributable to its
employees engaged in production in interstate commerce, and, two,
labor peace and thus smooth functioning of interstate commerce was
facilitated by the termination of substandard labor conditions affect-
ing all employees and not just those actually engaged in interstate
commerce.836
    Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act.—After its initial frus-
trations, Congress returned to the task of bolstering agriculture by

nance employees of building, part of which was rented to business producing goods
for interstate commerce); Walton v. Southern Package Corp., 320 U.S. 540 (1944)
(night watchman in a plant the substantial portion of the production of which was
shipped in interstate commerce); Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U.S. 126 (1944) (em-
ployees on stand-by auxiliary fire-fighting service of an employer engaged in inter-
state commerce); Borden Co. v. Borella, 325 U.S. 679 (1945) (maintenance employ-
ees in building housing company’s central offices where management was located
though the production of interstate commerce was elsewhere); Martino v. Michigan
Window Cleaning Co., 327 U.S. 173 (1946) (employees of a window-cleaning com-
pany the principal business of which was performed on windows of industrial plants
producing goods for interstate commerce); Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy & Associ-
ates, 358 U.S. 207 (1959) (nonprofessional employees of architectural firm working
on plans for construction of air bases, bus terminals, and radio facilities).
