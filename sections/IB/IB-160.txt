forbidden.860 In 1903, power was conferred upon the Secretary of
Agriculture to establish regulations to prevent the spread of such
diseases through foreign or interstate commerce.861 In 1905, the same
official was authorized to lay an absolute embargo or quarantine
upon all shipments of cattle from one state to another when the
public necessity might demand it.862 A statute passed in 1905 for-
bade the transportation in foreign and interstate commerce and the
mails of certain varieties of moths, plant lice, and other insect pests
injurious to plant crops, trees, and other vegetation.863 In 1912, a
similar exclusion of diseased nursery stock was decreed,864 while
by the same act and again by an act of 1917,865 the Secretary of
Agriculture was invested with powers of quarantine on interstate
commerce for the protection of plant life from disease similar to those
above described for the prevention of the spread of animal disease.
Although the Supreme Court originally held federal quarantine regu-
lations of this sort to be constitutionally inapplicable to intrastate
shipments of livestock, on the ground that federal authority ex-
tends only to foreign and interstate commerce,866 this view has to-
day been abandoned.
     The Lottery Case.—The first case to come before the Court in
which the issues discussed above were canvassed at all thoroughly
was Champion v. Ames,867 involving the act of 1895 “for the sup-
pression of lotteries.” 868 An earlier act excluding lottery tickets from
the mails had been upheld in the case In re Rapier,869 on the propo-
sition that Congress clearly had the power to see that the very fa-
cilities furnished by it were not put to bad use. But in the case of
commerce, the facilities are not ordinarily furnished by the Na-
tional Government, and the right to engage in foreign and inter-
state commerce comes from the Constitution itself or is anterior to
it.
     How difficult the Court found the question produced by the act
of 1895, forbidding any person to bring within the United States or
to cause to be “carried from one State to another” any lottery ticket,
or an equivalent thereof, “for the purpose of disposing of the same,”
was shown by the fact that the case was argued three times before
