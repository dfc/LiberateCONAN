sions without any indication that constitutional issues were thereby
raised.1294 These exclusions are no longer law. Present naturaliza-
tion statutes continue to require loyalty and good moral character
and generally bar subversives, terrorists, and criminals, among oth-
ers, from citizenship.1295
    Although the usual form of naturalization is through indi-
vidual application and official response on the basis of general con-
gressional rules, naturalization is not so limited. Citizenship can
be conferred by special act of Congress,1296 it can be conferred col-
lectively either through congressional action, such as the natural-
ization of all residents of an annexed territory or of a territory made
a state,1297 or through treaty provision.1298

Categories of Citizens: Birth and Naturalization
    The first sentence of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contem-
plates two sources of citizenship and two only: birth and naturaliza-
tion.1299 This contemplation is given statutory expression in § 301
of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,1300 which itemizes
those categories of persons who are citizens of the United States at
birth; all other persons in order to become citizens must pass through
the naturalization process. The first category merely tracks the lan-
guage of the first sentence of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment in
declaring that all persons born in the United States and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof are citizens by birth.1301 But there are six
other categories of citizens by birth. They are: (2) a person born in
the United States to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or
other aboriginal tribe, (3) a person born outside the United States
     1294 Cf. Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S. 178 (1922); United States v. Bhagat

Singh Thind, 261 U.S. 204 (1923); Toyota v. United States, 268 U.S. 402 (1925); Mor-
rison v. California, 291 U.S. 82 (1934). The Court refused to review the only case in
which the constitutional issue was raised and rejected. Kharaiti Ram Samras v. United
States, 125 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 634 (1942).
     1295 The Alien and Sedition Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 570, empowered the President

to deport any alien he found dangerous to the peace and safety of the Nation. In
1903, Congress provided for denial of naturalization and for deportation for mere
belief in certain doctrines, i.e., anarchy. Act of March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1214. See
United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U.S. 279 (1904). The range of forbid-
den views was broadened in 1918 (Act of October 15, 1918, § 1, 40 Stat. 1012) and
periodically thereafter. The present law is discussed in The Naturalization of Aliens,
infra.
     1296 E.g., 77 Stat. 5 (1963) (making Sir Winston Churchill an “honorary citizen

of the United States”).
