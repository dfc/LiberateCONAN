or more States, and when it is confined in its action entirely within
the limits of a single State. If its authority does not extend to an
agency in such commerce, when that agency is confined within the
limits of a State, its entire authority over interstate commerce may
be defeated. Several agencies combining, each taking up the com-
modity transported at the boundary line at one end of a State, and
leaving it at the boundary line at the other end, the Federal juris-
diction would be entirely ousted, and the constitutional provision
would become a dead letter.” 724 In short, it was admitted, inferen-
tially, that the principle of the decision would apply to land trans-
portation, but the actual demonstration of the fact still awaited some
years.725
     Hydroelectric Power; Flood Control.—As a consequence, in
part, of its power to forbid or remove obstructions to navigation in
the navigable waters of the United States, Congress has acquired
the right to develop hydroelectric power and the ancillary right to
sell it to all takers. By a long-standing doctrine of constitutional
law, the states possess dominion over the beds of all navigable streams
within their borders,726 but because of the servitude that Con-
gress’s power to regulate commerce imposes upon such streams, the
states, without the assent of Congress, practically are unable to use
their prerogative for power-development purposes. Sensing no doubt
that controlling power to this end must be attributed to some gov-
ernment in the United States and that “in such matters there can
be no divided empire,” 727 the Court held in United States v. Chandler-

     724 77 U.S. at 566. “The regulation of commerce implies as much control, as far-

reaching power, over an artificial as over a natural highway.” Justice Brewer for the
Court in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 342 (1893).
     725 Congress had the right to confer upon the Interstate Commerce Commission

the power to regulate interstate ferry rates, N.Y. Central R.R. v. Hudson County,
227 U.S. 248 (1913), and to authorize the Commission to govern the towing of ves-
sels between points in the same state but partly through waters of an adjoining
state. Cornell Steamboat Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 634 (1944). Congress’s power
over navigation extends to persons furnishing wharfage, dock, warehouse, and other
terminal facilities to a common carrier by water. Hence an order of the United States
Maritime Commission banning certain allegedly “unreasonable practices” by termi-
nals in the Port of San Francisco, and prescribing schedules of maximum free time
periods and of minimum charges was constitutional. California v. United States, 320
U.S. 577 (1944). The same power also comprises regulation of the registry enroll-
ment, license, and nationality of ships and vessels, the method of recording bills of
sale and mortgages thereon, the rights and duties of seamen, the limitations of the
responsibility of shipowners for the negligence and misconduct of their captains and
crews, and many other things of a character truly maritime. See The Lottawanna,
88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 577 (1875); Providence & N.Y. S.S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109
U.S. 578, 589 (1883); The Hamilton, 207 U.S. 398 (1907); O’Donnell v. Great Lakes
Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U.S. 36 (1943).
