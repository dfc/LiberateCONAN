ration.547 Income derived by independent engineering contractors from
the performance of state functions,548 the compensation of trustees
appointed to manage a street railway taken over and operated by a
state,549 profits derived from the sale of state bonds,550 or from oil
produced by lessees of state lands,551 have all been held to be sub-
ject to federal taxation despite a possible economic burden on the
state.
    In finally overruling Pollock, the Court stated that Pollock had
“merely represented one application of the more general rule that
neither the federal nor the state governments could tax income an
individual directly derived from any contract with another govern-
ment.” 552 That rule, the Court observed, had already been rejected
in numerous decisions involving intergovernmental immunity. “We
see no constitutional reason for treating persons who receive inter-
est on government bonds differently than persons who receive in-
come from other types of contracts with the government, and no
tenable rationale for distinguishing the costs imposed on States by
a tax on state bond interest from the costs imposed by a tax on the
income from any other state contract.” 553
     Scope of State Immunity From Federal Taxation.—
Although there have been sharp differences of opinion among mem-
bers of the Supreme Court in cases dealing with the tax immunity
of state functions and instrumentalities, the Court has stated that
“all agree that not all of the former immunity is gone.” 554 Twice,
the Court has made an effort to express its new point of view in a
statement of general principles by which the right to such immu-
nity shall be determined. However, the failure to muster a majority
to concur with any single opinion in the latter case leaves the ques-
tion very much in doubt. In Helvering v. Gerhardt,555 where, with-
out overruling Collector v. Day, it narrowed the immunity of sala-
ries of state officers from federal income taxation, the Court announced
“two guiding principles of limitation for holding the tax immunity
