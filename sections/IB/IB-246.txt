of citizen parents one of whom has been resident in the United States,
(4) a person born outside the United States of one citizen parent
who has been continuously resident in the United States for one
year prior to the birth and of a parent who is a national but not a
citizen, (5) a person born in an outlying possession of the United
States of one citizen parent who has been continuously resident in
the United States or an outlying possession for one year prior to
the birth, (6) a person of unknown parentage found in the United
States while under the age of five unless prior to his twenty-first
birthday he is shown not to have been born in the United States,
and (7) a person born outside the United States of an alien parent
and a citizen parent who has been resident in the United States
for a period of ten years, provided the person is to lose his citizen-
ship unless he resides continuously in the United States for a pe-
riod of five years between his fourteenth and twenty-eighth birth-
days.
    Subsection (7) citizens must satisfy the condition subsequent of
five years continuous residence within the United States between
the ages of fourteen and twenty-eight, a requirement held to be con-
stitutional,1302 which means in effect that for constitutional pur-
poses, according to the prevailing interpretation, there is a differ-
ence between persons born or naturalized in, that is, within, the
United States and persons born outside the confines of the United
States who are statutorily made citizens.1303 The principal differ-
ence is that the former persons may not be involuntarily expatri-
ated whereas the latter may be, subject only to due process protec-
tions.1304

The Naturalization of Aliens
    Although, as has been noted, throughout most of our history
there were significant racial and ethnic limitations upon eligibility
for naturalization, the present law prohibits any such discrimina-
tion.

    1302  Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971).
    1303  Compare Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964); Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S.
253 (1967). It will be noted that in practically all cases persons statutorily made
citizens at birth will be dual nationals, having the citizenship of the country where
they were born. Congress has never required a citizen having dual nationality to
elect at some point one and forsake the other but it has enacted several restrictive
statutes limiting the actions of dual nationals which have occasioned much litiga-
tion. E.g., Savorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S. 491 (1950); Kawakita v. United States,
343 U.S. 717 (1952); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963); Schneider
v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964); Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971).

Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963); Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 58â€“62 (1958).
