                       QUARTERING SOLDIERS


                          THIRD AMENDMENT
    No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house,
without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a
manner to be prescribed by law.
                                   IN GENERAL
           There has been no Supreme Court explication of this Amend-
       ment, which was obviously one guarantee indicating a preference
       for the civilian over the military.1




            1 In fact, save for the curious case of Engblom v. Carey, 677 F.2d 957 (2d Cir.

       1982), on remand, 572 F. Supp. 44 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), affâ€™d per curiam, 724 F.2d 28 (2d
       Cir. 1983), there has been no judicial explication of the Amendment at all.
