ments Clause, and broad remedial orders directed to improving prison
conditions and ameliorating prison life were imposed in more than
two dozen states.252 But, although the Supreme Court expressed gen-
eral agreement with the thrust of the lower court actions, it set aside
two rather extensive decrees and cautioned the federal courts to pro-
ceed with deference to the decisions of state legislatures and prison
administrators.253 In both cases, the prisons involved were of fairly
recent vintage and the conditions, while harsh, did not approach
the conditions described in many of the lower court decisions that
had been left undisturbed.254 Thus, concerns of federalism and of
judicial restraint apparently actuated the Court to begin to curb
the lower federal courts from ordering remedial action for systems
in which the prevailing circumstances, given the resources states
choose to devote to them, “cannot be said to be cruel and unusual
under contemporary standards.” 255
     Congress initially encouraged litigation over prison conditions
by enactment in 1980 of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Per-
sons Act,256 but then in 1996 added restrictions through enactment
of the Prison Litigation Reform Act.257 The Court upheld the latter
law’s provision for an automatic stay of prospective relief upon the
filing of a motion to modify or terminate that relief, ruling that sepa-
ration of powers principles were not violated.258

Limitation of the Clause to Criminal Punishments
   The Eighth Amendment deals only with criminal punishment,
and has no application to civil processes. In holding the Amend-

curring) (collecting cases). See Note, Complex Enforcement: Unconstitutional Prison
Conditions, 94 HARV. L. REV. 626 (1981).

     254 See, e.g., Pugh v. Locke, 406 F. Supp. 318 (M.D. Ala. 1976) (describing condi-

tions of “horrendous overcrowding,” inadequate sanitation, infested food, and “ram-
pant violence”); Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1981) (describing condi-
tions “unfit for human habitation”). The primary issue in both Wolfish and Chapman
was that of “double-celling,” the confinement of two or more prisoners in a cell de-
signed for one. In both cases, the Court found the record did not support orders
ending the practice.

Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (1991) (allowing modification, based on a signifi-
cant change in law or facts, of a 1979 consent decree that had ordered construction
of a new jail with single-occupancy cells; modification was to depend upon whether
the upsurge in jail population was anticipated when the decree was entered, and
whether the decree was premised on the mistaken belief that single-celling is consti-
tutionally mandated).
