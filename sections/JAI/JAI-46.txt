     Twelve years after Harmelin the Court still could not reach a
consensus on rationale for rejecting a proportionality challenge to
California’s “three-strikes” law, as applied to sentence a repeat felon
to 25 years to life imprisonment for stealing three golf clubs valued
at $399 apiece.230 A plurality of three Justices (O’Connor, Kennedy,
and Chief Justice Rehnquist) determined that the sentence was “jus-
tified by the State’s public safety interest in incapacitating and de-
terring recidivist felons, and amply supported by [the petitioner’s]
long, serious criminal record,” and hence was not the “rare case” of
“gross disproportional[ity].” 231 The other two Justices voting in the
majority were Justice Scalia, who objected that the proportionality
principle cannot be intelligently applied when the penological goal
is incapacitation rather than retribution,232 and Justice Thomas, who
asserted that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause “con-
tains no proportionality principle.” 233 Not surprisingly, the Court
also rejected a habeas corpus challenge to California’s “three-
strikes” law for failure to clear the statutory hurdle of establishing
that the sentencing was contrary to, or an unreasonable applica-
tion of, “clearly established federal law.234 Justice O’Connor’s opin-
ion for a five-Justice majority explained, in understatement, that
the Court’s precedents in the area “have not been a model of clar-
ity . . . that have established a clear or consistent path for courts
to follow.” 235
     Declaring that “[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the
Eighth Amendment,” Justice Kennedy, writing for a five-Justice ma-
jority in Graham v. Florida,236 held that “[t]he Constitution prohib-
its the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile
offender who did not commit homicide.” 237 Justice Kennedy charac-
terized proportionality cases as falling within two general types. The
first type comprises challenges to the length of actual sentences im-
posed as being grossly disproportionate, and such challenges are re-
solved under approaches taken in Solem, Harmelin, and similar cases.

     232 538 U.S. at 31.
     233 538 U.S. at 32. The four dissenting Justices thought that the sentence was

invalid under the Harmelin test used by the plurality, although they suggested that
the Solem v. Helm test would have been more appropriate for a recidivism case. See
538 U.S. at 32, n.1 (opinion of Justice Stevens).
     234 Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63 (2003). The three-strikes law had been used

to impose two consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences on a 37-year-old convicted of two
petty thefts with a prior conviction.
     235 538 U.S. at 72.
     236 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–7412, slip op. (2010).
     237 Id. at 31. The opinion distinguishes life without parole from a life sentence.

An offender need not be guaranteed eventual release under the Graham holding,
just a realistic opportunity for release based on conduct during confinement.
