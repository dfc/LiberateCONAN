    Limitations on Habeas Corpus Review of Capital Sen-
tences.—The Court’s rulings limiting federal habeas corpus review
of state convictions, reinforced by the Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996,179 may be expected to reduce signifi-
cantly the amount of federal court litigation over state imposition
of capital punishment. In the habeas context, the Court rejected the
“death is different” approach by applying to capital cases the same
rules that limit federal petitions in non-capital cases.180 Then, in
In re Troy Anthony Davis,181 the Court found a death-row convict
with a claim of actual innocence to be entitled to a District Court
determination of his habeas petition.182
     The Court held in Penry v. Lynaugh 183 that its Teague v. Lane 184
rule of nonretroactivity applies to capital sentencing challenges. Un-
der Teague, new rules of constitutional interpretation announced af-
ter a defendant’s conviction has become final will not be applied in
habeas cases unless one of two exceptions applies.185 The two excep-
tions—the situations in which “[a] new rule applies retroactively in
a collateral proceeding”—are when “(1) the rule is substantive or
(2) the rule is a ‘watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure’ implicating
the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceed-
ing.” 186 The first exception has also been stated to be “that a new

(per curiam), requiring a threshold evidentiary showing before a defendant claiming
selective prosecution on the basis of race is entitled to a discovery order that the
government provide information on its decisions to seek the death penalty.

     180 Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 405 (1993) (“we have ‘refused to hold that

the fact that a death sentence has been imposed requires a different standard of
review on federal habeas corpus’ ”) (quoting Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 9 (1989)).

     182 Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer,

noted that the fact that seven of the state’s key witnesses had recanted their trial
testimony, and that several people had implicated the state’s principal witness as
the shooter, made the case “exceptional.” Justices Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,
dissented.

     184 489 U.S. 288 (1989).
     185 The “new rule” limitation was suggested in a plurality opinion in Teague,

and a Court majority in Penry and later cases adopted it. In Danforth v. Minnesota,
128 S. Ct. 1029, 1033 (2008), the Court held that Teague does not “constrain[ ] the
authority of state courts to give broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure
than is required by that opinion.”
     186 Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007). In Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S.

484, 494, 495 (1990), the Court stated the two exceptions as follows: “The first excep-
tion permits the retroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a class of
private conduct beyond the power of the State to proscribe . . . or addresses a ‘sub-
stantive categorical guarante[e] accorded by the Constitution,’ such as a rule ‘prohib-
iting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their
status or offense.’ . . . The second exception is for ‘watershed rules of criminal pro-
cedure’ implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceed-
ing.”
