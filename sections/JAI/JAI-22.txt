trate on determining whether the prosecution had proved defen-
dant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.100
    The overarching principle of Furman and of the Gregg series of
cases was that the jury should not be “without guidance or direc-
tion” in deciding whether a convicted defendant should live or die.
The jury’s attention was statutorily “directed to the specific circum-
stances of the crime . . . and on the characteristics of the person
who committed the crime.” 101 Discretion was channeled and ratio-
nalized. But, in Lockett v. Ohio,102 a Court plurality determined that
a state law was invalid because it prevented the sentencer from giv-
ing weight to any mitigating factors other than those specified in
the law. In other words, the jury’s discretion was curbed too much.
“[W]e conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments re-
quire that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case,
not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any as-
pect of a defendant’s character or record and any of the circum-
stances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a
sentence less than death.” 103 Similarly, the reason that a three-
justice plurality viewed North Carolina’s mandatory death sen-
tence for persons convicted of first degree murder as invalid was
     100 Also impermissible as distorting a jury’s role are prosecutor’s comments or

jury instructions that mislead a jury as to its primary responsibility for deciding
whether to impose the death penalty. Compare Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320
(1985) (jury’s responsibility is undermined by court-sanctioned remarks by prosecu-
tor that jury’s decision is not final, but is subject to appellate review) with Califor-
nia v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992 (1983) (jury responsibility not undermined by instruc-
tion that governor has power to reduce sentence of life imprisonment without parole).
See also Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988) (poll of jury and supplemental
jury instruction on obligation to consult and attempt to reach a verdict was not un-
duly coercive on death sentence issue, even though consequence of failing to reach a
verdict was automatic imposition of life sentence without parole); Romano v. Okla-
homa, 512 U.S. 1 (1994) (imposition of death penalty after introduction of evidence
that defendant had been sentenced to death previously did not diminish the jury’s
sense of responsibility so as to violate the Eighth Amendment); Jones v. United States,
527 U.S. 373 (1999) (court’s refusal to instruct the jury on the consequences of dead-
lock did not violate Eighth Amendment, even though court’s actual instruction was
misleading as to range of possible sentences).
     101 Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 197–98 (1976) (plurality).
     102 438 U.S. 586 (1978). The plurality opinion by Chief Justice Burger was joined

by Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens. Justices Blackmun, Marshall, and White
concurred in the result on separate and conflicting grounds. Id. at 613, 619, 621.
Justice Rehnquist dissented. Id. at 628.
     103 438 U.S. at 604 (emphasis in original). Although, under the Eighth and Four-

teenth Amendments, the state must bear the burden “to prove the existence of ag-
gravating circumstances, a defendant’s constitutional rights are not violated by plac-
ing on him the burden of proving mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial
to call for leniency.” Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 650 (1990) (plurality). A for-
tiori, a statute “may direct imposition of the death penalty when the State has proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including
where the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances are in equi-
poise.” Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 173 (2006).
