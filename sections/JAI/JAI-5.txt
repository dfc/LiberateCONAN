to curtail excessive bail without guaranteeing a right to bail, or
whether the phrase “excessive bail” was meant to be a shorthand
expression of both rights.
     Compounding the ambiguity is a distinctive trend in the United
States that had its origin in a provision of the Massachusetts Body
of Liberties of 1641: 15 guaranteeing bail to every accused person
except those charged with a capital crime or contempt in open court.
Copied in several state constitutions,16 this guarantee was con-
tained in the Northwest Ordinance in 1787,17 along with a guaran-
tee of moderate fines and against cruel and unusual punishments,
and was inserted in the Judiciary Act of 1789,18 enacted contempo-
raneously with the passage through Congress of the Bill of Rights.
It appears, therefore, that Congress was aware in 1789 that cer-
tain language conveyed a right to bail and that certain other lan-
guage merely protected against one means by which a pre-existing
right to bail could be abridged.
     Long unresolved was the issue of whether “preventive detention”—
the denial of bail to an accused, unconvicted defendant because it
is feared or it is found probable that if released he will be a danger
to the community—is constitutionally permissible. Not until 1984
did Congress authorize preventive detention in federal criminal pro-
ceedings.19
     15 “No mans person shall be restrained or imprisoned by any Authority what so

ever, before the law hath sentenced him thereto, If he can put in sufficient securtie,
bayle, or mainprise, for his appearance, and good behavior in the meane time, unlesse
it be in Crimes Capitall, and Contempts in open Court, and in such cases where
some expresse act of Court doth allow it.” Reprinted in I DOCUMENTS ON FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN RIGHTS 79, 82 (Z. Chafee, ed., 1951).
     16 “That all prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital

offences, where the proof is evident, or the presumption great.” 5 F. Thorpe, The
Federal and State Constitutions, H. DOC. NO. 357, 59th Congress, 2d Sess. 3061 (1909)
(Pennsylvania, 1682). The 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution contained the same clause
in section 28, and in section 29 was a clause guaranteeing against excessive bail.

     17 “All persons shall be bailable, unless for capital offences, where the proof shall

be evident, or the presumption great. All fines shall be moderate; and no cruel or
unusual punishments shall be inflicted.” Art. II, 32 JOURNALS OF THE CONTINENTAL CON-
GRESS 334 (1787), reprinted in 1 Stat. 52 n.
     18 “And upon all arrests in criminal cases, bail shall be admitted, except where

the punishment may be death, in which case it shall not be admitted but by the
supreme or a circuit court, or by a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of a
district court, who shall exercise their discretion herein . . . .” 1 Stat. 91 § 33 (1789).
     19 Congress first provided for pretrial detention without bail of certain persons

and certain classes of persons in the District of Columbia. D.C. Code, §§ 23–1321 et
seq., held constitutional in United States v. Edwards, 430 A.2d 1321 (D.C. App. 1981),
cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1022 (1982). The law applies only to persons charged with
violating statutes applicable exclusively in the District of Columbia, United States
v. Thompson, 452 F.2d 1333 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 998 (1978), while
in other federal courts, the Bail Reform Act of 1966, as amended, applies. 80 Stat.
