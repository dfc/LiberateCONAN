the defendant’s future dangerousness, due process requires that the
jury be informed if the alternative to a death sentence is a life sen-
tence without possibility of parole.121
    What is the effect on a death sentence if an “eligibility factor”
(a factor making the defendant eligible for the death penalty) or an
“aggravating factor” (a factor, to be weighed against mitigating fac-
tors, in determining whether a defendant who has been found eli-
gible for the death penalty should receive it) is found invalid? In
Brown v. Sanders, the Court announced “the following rule: An in-
validated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will
render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an im-
proper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process un-
less one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give
aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.” 122
    Appellate review under a harmless error standard can preserve
a death sentence based in part on a jury’s consideration of an ag-
gravating factor later found to be invalid,123 or on a trial judge’s
consideration of improper aggravating circumstances.124 In each case
the sentencing authority had found other aggravating circum-
stances justifying imposition of capital punishment, and in Zant evi-
dence relating to the invalid factor was nonetheless admissible on
another basis.125 Even in states that require the jury to weigh statu-
tory aggravating and mitigating circumstances (and even in the ab-
independently assess any mitigating factors before jury as a whole balanced the weight
of mitigating evidence against each aggravating factor, with unanimity required be-
fore balance in favor of an aggravating factor may be found).

Carolina, 532 U.S. 36 (2001) (amended South Carolina law still runs afoul of Sim-
mons); Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U.S. 246 (2002) (prosecutor need not express
intent to rely on future dangerousness; logical inference may be drawn). But see Ramdass
v. Angelone, 530 U.S. 156 (2000) (refusing to apply Simmons because the defendant
was not technically parole ineligible at time of sentencing).
     122 546 U.S. 212, 220 (2006). In some states, “the only aggravating factors per-

mitted to be considered by the sentencer [are] the specified eligibility factors.” Id. at
217. These are known as weighing states; non-weighing states, by contrast, are those
that permit “the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addi-
tion to, the eligibility factors.” Id. Prior to Brown v. Sanders, in weighing states, the
Court deemed “the sentencer’s consideration of an invalid eligibility factor” to re-
quire “reversal of the sentence (unless a state appellate court determined the error
was harmless or reweighed the mitigating evidence against the valid aggravating
factors).” Id.

     125 In Eighth Amendment cases as in other contexts involving harmless consti-

tutional error, the court must find that error was “ ‘harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt in that it did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained.’ ” Sochor v. Florida,
504 U.S. 527, 540 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)). Thus,
where psychiatric testimony was introduced regarding an invalid statutory aggravat-
ing circumstance, and where the defendant was not provided the assistance of an
independent psychiatrist in order to develop rebuttal testimony, the lack of rebuttal
