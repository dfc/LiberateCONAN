juveniles less morally culpable for their actions. Because juveniles
lack maturity and have an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,
they often engage in “impetuous and ill-considered actions and de-
cisions.” Juveniles are also more susceptible than adults to “nega-
tive influences” and peer pressure. Finally, the character of juve-
niles is not as well formed, and their personality traits are “more
transitory, less fixed.” 168 For these reasons, irresponsible conduct
by juveniles is “not as morally reprehensible,” they have “a greater
claim than adults to be forgiven,” and “a greater possibility exists
that a minor’s character deficiencies will be reformed.” 169 Because
of the diminished culpability of juveniles, the penological objectives
of retribution and deterrence do not provide adequate justification
for imposition of the death penalty. The majority preferred a cat-
egorical rule over individualized assessment of each offender’s ma-
turity, explaining that “[t]he differences between juvenile and adult
offenders are too marked and well understood to risk allowing a
youthful person to receive the death penalty despite insufficient cul-
pability.” 170
    The Roper Court found confirmation for its holding in “the over-
whelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death
penalty.” 171 Although “not controlling,” the rejection of the juvenile
death penalty by other nations and by international authorities was
“instructive,” as it had been in earlier cases, for Eighth Amend-
ment interpretation.172
    Limitations on Capital Punishment: Equality of Applica-
tion.—One of the principal objections to imposition of the death pen-
alty, voiced by Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Fur-
gravity of the offense, that considers age as one indicator of culpability, and that
looks to other statutory age classifications to arrive at a conclusion about the level
of maturity and responsibility that society expects of juveniles. 492 U.S. at 394–96.
The Atkins majority adopted the approach of the Stanford dissenters, conducting a
proportionality review that brought their own “evaluation” into play along with their
analysis of consensus on the issue of executing the mentally retarded.

     170 543 U.S. at 572–573. Strongly disagreeing, Justice O’Connor wrote that “an

especially depraved juvenile offender may . . . be just as culpable as many adult
offenders considered bad enough to deserve the death penalty. . . . [E]specially for
17-year-olds . . . the relevant differences between ‘adults’ and ‘juveniles’ appear to
be a matter of degree, rather than of kind.” Id. at 600.
