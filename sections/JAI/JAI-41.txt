illustrates how these restrictions can operate to defeat challenges
to state-imposed death sentences.203
     In Carey v. Musladin,204 the Court noted that it had previously
held that “the State cannot, consistently with the Fourteenth Amend-
ment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed
in identifiable prison clothes,” 205 but that it had never ruled on the
effect on a defendant’s fair trial rights of spectator conduct. In Carey,
the spectator conduct that allegedly affected the defendant’s right
to a fair trial consisted of members of the victim’s family wearing
buttons with the victim’s photograph. Given the lack of holdings from
the Court on the question of spectator conduct, the Court in Carey
found that “it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y]
appli[ed] clearly established Federal law” in denying the defendant
relief.206 Consequently, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen-
alty Act of 1996 precluded habeas relief. Similarly, because the Su-
preme Court has never ruled on whether, during a plea hearing at
which the defendant pleads guilty, defense counsel’s being linked
to the courtroom by speaker phone, rather than being physically
present, is likely to result in such poor performance that the Cronic
standard for ineffective assistance of counsel should apply, the Court
again could not say “that the state court ‘unreasonabl[y] appli[ed]
clearly established Federal law.’ ” 207
     The Court has also ruled that a death row inmate has no con-
stitutional right to an attorney to help prepare a petition for state
collateral review.208
     203 The state court’s decision, which applied the rule from Strickland v. Washing-

ton, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), rather than the rule from United States v. Cronic, 466
U.S. 648 (1984), to hold that the attorney’s performance was not constitutionally
inadequate, was not “contrary to” clearly established law. Cronic had held that there
are some situations, e.g., when counsel “entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s
case to meaningful adversarial testing,” so presumptively unfair as to obviate the
need to show actual prejudice to the defendant’s case. See “Effective Assistance of
Counsel” under Sixth Amendment. The Bell v. Cone Court emphasized the word “en-
tirely,” noting that the petitioner challenged the defense attorney’s performance only
“at specific points” in the process. Nor was the second statutory test met. Strickland,
a “highly deferential” test asking whether an attorney’s performance fell below an
“objective standard of reasonableness,” was not “unreasonably applied.” The attor-
ney could reasonably have concluded that evidence presented during the guilt phase
of the trial was still “fresh” to the jury, and that repetition through the presentation
of mitigating evidence or through a closing statement was unnecessary to counter
the state’s presentation of aggravating circumstances justifying a death sentence.
