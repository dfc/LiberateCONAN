lenge to punishment goes to the length rather than the seriousness
of the offense, the choice is necessarily subjective. Therefore, the
Rummel rule appeared to be that states may punish any behavior
properly classified as a felony with any length of imprisonment purely
as a matter legislative grace.218 The Court dismissed as unavailing
the factors relied on by the defendant. First, the fact that the na-
ture of the offense was nonviolent was found not necessarily rel-
evant to the seriousness of a crime, and the determination of what
is a “small” amount of money, being so subjective, was a legislative
task. In any event, the state could focus on recidivism, not the spe-
cific acts. Second, the comparison of punishment imposed for the
same offenses in other jurisdictions was found unhelpful, differ-
ences and similarities being more subtle than gross, and in any case
in a federal system one jurisdiction would always be more severe
than the rest. Third, the comparison of punishment imposed for other
offenses in the same state ignored the recidivism aspect.219
     Rummel was distinguished in Solem v. Helm,220 the Court stat-
ing unequivocally that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause
“prohibits not only barbaric punishments, but also sentences that
are disproportionate to the crime committed,” and that “[t]here is
no basis for the State’s assertion that the general principle of pro-
portionality does not apply to felony prison sentences.” 221 Helm, like
Rummel, had been sentenced under a recidivist statute following
conviction for a nonviolent felony involving a small amount of money.222
The difference was that Helm’s sentence of life imprisonment with-
out possibility of parole was viewed as “far more severe than the
life sentence we considered in Rummel v. Estelle.” 223 Rummel, the
Court pointed out, “was likely to have been eligible for parole within
12 years of his initial confinement,” whereas Helm had only the pos-
sibility of executive clemency, characterized by the Court as “noth-
ing more than a hope for ‘an ad hoc exercise of clemency.’ ” 224 The
Solem Court also spelled out the “objective criteria” by which pro-
portionality issues should be judged: “(I) the gravity of the offense
     218 In Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370 (1982), on the authority of Rummel, the Court

summarily reversed a decision holding disproportionate a prison term of 40 years
and a fine of $20,000 for defendant’s possession and distribution of approximately
nine ounces of marijuana said to have a street value of about $200.
     219 Rummel, 445 U.S. at 275–82. The dissent deemed these three factors to be

sufficiently objective to apply and thought they demonstrated the invalidity of the
sentence imposed. Id. at 285, 295–303.
     220 463 U.S. 277 (1983). The case, like Rummel, was decided by a 5–4 vote.
     221 463 U.S. at 284, 288.
     222 The final conviction was for uttering a no-account check in the amount of

$100; previous felony convictions were also for nonviolent crimes described by the
Court as “relatively minor.” 463 U.S. at 296–97.
     223 463 U.S. at 297.
     224 463 U.S. at 297, 303.
