ity of offenders to control their behavior, yet “the same cognitive
and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less mor-
ally culpable . . . also make it less likely that they can process the
information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a
result, control their conduct based on that information.” 157
    In Atkins, the Court wrote, “As was our approach in Ford v.
Wainwright with regard to insanity, ‘we leave to the State[s] the
task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional
restriction upon [their] execution of sentences.’ ” 158 In Schriro v. Smith,
the Court again quoted this language, holding that “[t]he Ninth Cir-
cuit erred in commanding the Arizona courts to conduct a jury trial
to resolve Smith’s mental retardation claim.” 159 States, the Court
added, are entitled to “adopt[ ] their own measures for adjudicat-
ing claims of mental retardation,” though “those measures might,
in their application, be subject to constitutional challenge.” 160
     The Court’s conclusion that execution of juveniles constitutes cruel
and unusual punishment evolved in much the same manner. Ini-
tially, a closely divided Court invalidated one statutory scheme that
permitted capital punishment to be imposed for crimes committed
before age 16, but upheld other statutes authorizing capital punish-
ment for crimes committed by 16- and 17-year-olds. Important to
resolution of the first case was the fact that Oklahoma set no mini-
mum age for capital punishment, but by separate provision al-
lowed juveniles to be treated as adults for some purposes.161 Al-
though four Justices favored a flat ruling that the Eighth Amendment
barred the execution of anyone younger than 16 at the time of his
offense, concurring Justice O’Connor found Oklahoma’s scheme de-
fective as not having necessarily resulted from the special care and
deliberation that must attend decisions to impose the death pen-
alty. The following year Justice O’Connor again provided the deci-
sive vote when the Court in Stanford v. Kentucky held that the Eighth
Amendment does not categorically prohibit imposition of the death
penalty for individuals who commit crimes at age 16 or 17. Like
Oklahoma, neither Kentucky nor Missouri 162 directly specified a mini-
mum age for the death penalty. To Justice O’Connor, however, the
critical difference was that there clearly was no national consensus
    157 536 U.S. at 320. The Court also noted that reduced capacity both increases

the risk of false confessions and reduces a defendant’s ability to assist counsel in
making a persuasive showing of mitigation.
