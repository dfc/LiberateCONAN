Proportionality
    In O’Neil v. Vermont,209 Justice Field argued in dissent that, in
addition to prohibiting punishments deemed barbarous and inhu-
mane, the Eighth Amendment also condemned “all punishments which
by their excessive length or severity are greatly disproportionate to
the offenses charged.” In Weems v. United States,210 the Court ad-
opted this view in striking down a sentence in the Philippine Is-
lands of 15 years incarceration at hard labor with chains on the
ankles, loss of all civil rights, and perpetual surveillance, for the
offense of falsifying public documents. The Court compared the sen-
tence with those meted out for other offenses and concluded: “This
contrast shows more than different exercises of legislative judg-
ment. It is greater than that. It condemns the sentence in this case
as cruel and unusual. It exhibits a difference between unrestrained
power and that which is exercised under the spirit of constitutional
limitations formed to establish justice.” 211 Punishments as well as
fines, therefore, can be condemned as excessive.212
     In Robinson v. California 213 the Court carried the principle to
new heights, setting aside a conviction under a law making it a
crime to “be addicted to the use of narcotics.” The statute was un-
constitutional because it punished the “mere status” of being an ad-
dict without any requirement of a showing that a defendant had
ever used narcotics within the jurisdiction of the state or had com-
mitted any act at all within the state’s power to proscribe, and be-
cause addiction is an illness that—however it is acquired—
physiologically compels the victim to continue using drugs. The case
could stand for the principle, therefore, that one may not be pun-
ished for a status in the absence of some act,214 or it could stand
for the broader principle that it is cruel and unusual to punish some-
one for conduct that he is unable to control, which would make it a

(1903).
     210 217 U.S. 349 (1910). The Court was here applying not the Eighth Amend-

ment but a statutory bill of rights applying to the Philippines, which it interpreted
as having the same meaning. Id. at 367.
     211 217 U.S. at 381.
     212 “The Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits ‘excessive’ sanctions.” Atkins v.

Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 311 (2002) (applying proportionality review to determine whether
execution of the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual). Proportionality in the con-
text of capital punishment is considered under “Limitations on Capital Punishment:
Proportionality,” supra.
     213 370 U.S. 660 (1962).
     214 A different approach to essentially the same problem was taken in Thomp-

son v. Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 206 (1960), which set aside a conviction for loitering
and disorderly conduct as being supported by “no evidence whatever.” Cf. Johnson v.
Florida, 391 U.S. 596 (1968) (no evidence that the defendant was “wandering or stroll-
ing around” in violation of vagrancy law).
