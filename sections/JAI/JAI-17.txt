man.79 Divisions among the Justices, however, made it difficult to
ascertain the form that permissible statutory schemes may take.80
     Because the three Justices in the majority in Furman who did
not altogether reject the death penalty thought the problems with
the system revolved about discriminatory and arbitrary imposi-
tion,81 legislatures turned to enactment of statutes that purported
to do away with these difficulties. One approach was to provide for
automatic imposition of the death penalty upon conviction for cer-
tain forms of murder. More commonly, states established special pro-
cedures to follow in capital cases, and specified aggravating and miti-
gating factors that the sentencing authority must consider in imposing
sentence. In five cases in 1976, the Court rejected automatic sen-
tencing, but approved other statutes specifying factors for jury con-
sideration.82
     First, the Court concluded that the death penalty as a punish-
ment for murder does not itself constitute cruel and unusual pun-
ishment. Although there were differences of degree among the seven
Justices in the majority on this point, they all seemed to concur
that reenactment of capital punishment statutes by 35 states pre-
cluded the Court from concluding that this form of penalty was no
longer acceptable to a majority of the American people. Rather, they
concluded, a large proportion of American society continued to re-
gard it as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction. Neither
is it possible, the Court continued, to rule that the death penalty
does not comport with the basic concept of human dignity at the
core of the Eighth Amendment. Courts are not free to substitute
      79 Justices Brennan and Marshall adhered to the view that the death penalty is

per se unconstitutional. E.g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 600 (1977); Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 619 (1978); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 801 (1982).
      80 A comprehensive evaluation of the multiple approaches followed in Furman-

era cases may be found in Radin, The Jurisprudence of Death: Evolving Standards
for the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, 126 U. PA. L. REV. 989 (1978).
      81 Thus, Justice Douglas thought the penalty had been applied discriminatorily,

Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), Justice Stewart thought it “wantonly and
. . . freakishly imposed,” id. at 310, and Justice White thought it had been applied
so infrequently that it served no justifying end. Id. at 313.
      82 The principal opinion was in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976) (uphold-

ing statute providing for a bifurcated proceeding separating the guilt and sentenc-
ing phases, requiring the jury to find at least one of ten statutory aggravating fac-
tors before imposing death, and providing for review of death sentences by the Georgia
Supreme Court). Statutes of two other states were similarly sustained, Proffitt v.
Florida, 428 U.S. 242 (1976) (statute generally similar to Georgia’s, with the excep-
tion that the trial judge, rather than jury, was directed to weigh statutory aggravat-
ing factors against statutory mitigating factors), and Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262
(1976) (statute construed as narrowing death-eligible class, and lumping mitigating
factors into consideration of future dangerousness), while those of two other states
were invalidated, Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976), and Roberts v.
Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325 (1976) (both mandating death penalty for first-degree mur-
der).
