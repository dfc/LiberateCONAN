     A second restriction on federal habeas review also has ramifica-
tions for capital sentencing review. Claims that state convictions are
unsupported by the evidence are weighed by a “rational factfinder”
inquiry: “whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most fa-
vorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact have found the
essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” 191 This
same standard for reviewing alleged errors of state law, the Court
determined, should be used by a federal habeas court to weigh a
claim that a generally valid aggravating factor is unconstitutional
as applied to the defendant.192 In addition, the Court has held that,
absent an independent constitutional violation, habeas corpus re-
lief for prisoners who assert innocence based on newly discovered
evidence should generally be denied.193 In In re Troy Anthony Da-
vis,194 however, the Court found a death-row convict with a claim
of actual innocence to be entitled to a District Court determination
of his habeas petition.195
    Third, a different harmless error rule is applied when constitu-
tional errors are alleged in habeas proceedings. The Chapman v.

(1985 ruling in Caldwell v. Mississippi, although a “predictable development in Eighth
Amendment law,” established a “new rule” that false prosecutorial comment on ju-
rors’ responsibility can violate the Eighth Amendment by creating an unreasonable
risk of arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, since no case prior to Caldwell had
invalidated a prosecutorial comment on Eighth Amendment grounds). But see Stringer
v. Black, 503 U.S. 222 (1992) (neither Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356 (1988),
nor Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738 (1990), announced a “new rule”).
     191 Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 781 (1990) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443

U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).
     192 Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780–84 (1990). The lower court erred, there-

fore, in conducting a comparative review to determine whether application in the
defendant’s case was consistent with other applications.
     193 Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993) (holding that a petitioner would have

to meet an “extraordinarily high” threshold of proof of innocence to warrant federal
habeas relief). Accord, House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 554–55 (2006) (defendant failed
to meet Herrera standard but nevertheless put forward enough evidence of inno-
cence to meet the less onerous standard of Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298 (1995), which
“held that prisoners asserting innocence as a gateway to [habeas relief for claims
forfeited under state law] must establish that, in light of new evidence, ‘it is more
likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt.’ ” Id. at 2076–2077, quoting Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. at 327.)
The Court here distinguished “freestanding” claims under Herrera from “gateway”
claims under Schlup, the difference apparently being that success on a freestanding
claim results in the overturning of a conviction, whereas success on a gateway claim
results in a remand to the trial court to hear the claim. See also Article III, Habeas
Corpus: Scope of the Writ.
     194 557 U.S. ___, No. 08–1443 (2009).
     195 Justice Stevens, in a concurring opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer,

“refuse[d] to endorse” Justice Scalia’s reasoning (in a dissent joined by Justice Thomas)
that would read the Constitution to permit the execution of a convict “who pos-
sesses new evidence conclusively and definitively proving, beyond any scintilla of
doubt, that he is an innocent man.”
