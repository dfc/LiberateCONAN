    The Court first tested and upheld under the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment a state statute providing for preven-
tive detention of juveniles.20 Then, in United States v. Salerno,21
the Court upheld application of preventive detention provisions of
the Bail Reform Act of 1984 against facial challenge under the Eighth
Amendment. The function of bail, the Court explained, is limited
neither to preventing flight of the defendant prior to trial nor to
safeguarding a court’s role in adjudicating guilt or innocence. “[W]e
reject the proposition that the Eighth Amendment categorically pro-
hibits the government from pursuing other admittedly compelling
interests through regulation of pretrial release.” 22 Instead, “[t]he
only arguable substantive limitation of the Bail Clause is that the
government’s proposed conditions of release or detention not be ‘ex-
cessive’ in light of the perceived evil.” 23 “[D]etention prior to trial
of arrestees charged with serious felonies who are found after an
adversary hearing to pose a threat to the safety of individuals or to
the community which no condition of release can dispel” satisfies
this requirement.24
     Bail is “excessive” in violation of the Eighth Amendment when
it is set at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to
ensure the asserted governmental interest.25 If the only asserted
interest is to guarantee that the accused will stand trial and sub-
mit to sentence if found guilty, then “bail must be set by a court at
a sum designed to ensure that goal, and no more.” 26 To challenge
bail as excessive, one must move for a reduction, and, if that mo-
tion is denied, appeal to the Court of Appeals, and, if unsuccessful,
appeal to the Supreme Court Justice sitting for that circuit.27 The

added general preventive detention authority. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(d) and (e). Those
amendments authorized pretrial detention for persons charged with certain serious
crimes (e.g., crimes of violence, capital crimes, and crimes punishable by 10 or more
years’ imprisonment) if the court or magistrate finds that no conditions will reason-
ably assure both the appearance of the person and the safety of others. Detention
can also be ordered in other cases where there is a serious risk that the person will
flee or that the person will attempt to obstruct justice. Preventive detention laws
have also been adopted in some states. Parker v. Roth, 202 Neb. 850, 278 N.W.2d
106, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 920 (1979).
     20 Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253 (1984).
     21 481 U.S. 739 (1988).
     22 481 U.S. at 753.
     23 481 U.S. at 754.
     24 481 U.S. at 755. The Court also ruled that there was no violation of due pro-

cess, the governmental objective being legitimate and there being a number of pro-
cedural safeguards (detention applies only to serious crimes, the arrestee is entitled
to a prompt hearing, the length of detention is limited, and detainees must be housed
apart from criminals).
