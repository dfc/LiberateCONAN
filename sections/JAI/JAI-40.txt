California 196 rule applicable on direct appeal, requiring the state
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a constitutional error is
harmless, is inappropriate for habeas review, the Court concluded,
given the “secondary and limited” role of federal habeas proceed-
ings.197 The appropriate test is that previously used only for non-
constitutional errors: “whether the error has substantial and injuri-
ous effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.” 198 Further,
the “substantial and injurious effect standard” is to be applied in
federal habeas proceedings even “when the state appellate court failed
to recognize the error and did not review it for harmlessness under
the ‘harmless beyond a reasonable doubt’ standard set forth in Chap-
man v. California . . . .” 199
    A fourth rule was devised to prevent successive “abusive” or de-
faulted habeas petitions. Federal courts are barred from hearing such
claims unless the defendant can show by clear and convincing evi-
dence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would
have found him eligible for the death penalty under applicable state
law.200
    The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 pro-
hibits federal habeas relief based on claims that were adjudicated
on the merits in state court unless the state decision “was contrary
to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States.” 201 The Court’s decision in Bell v. Cone,202 rejecting a claim
that an attorney’s failure to present mitigating evidence during the
capital sentencing phase of a trial and his waiver of a closing argu-
ment at sentencing should entitle a condemned prisoner to relief,

    198 Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. at 637 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States,

328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)). Brecht was a non-capital case, but the rule was subse-
quently applied in a capital case. Calderon v. Coleman, 525 U.S. 141 (1998) (per
curiam). In Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 129 S. Ct. 530 (2008) (per curiam), the Court held
that a reviewing court should apply Brecht’s “substantial and injurious effect” stan-
dard where conviction was based on a general verdict after jury had been instructed
on alternative theories of guilt and may have relied on an invalid one.

    200 Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333 (1992). The focus on eligibility limits in-

quiry to elements of the crime and to aggravating factors, and thereby prevents pre-
sentation of mitigating evidence. Here the court was barred from considering an al-
legation of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to introduce the defendant’s
mental health records as a mitigating factor at sentencing.
