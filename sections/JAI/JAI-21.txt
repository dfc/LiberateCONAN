     The proscription against a mandatory death penalty has also
received elaboration. The Court invalidated statutes making death
the mandatory sentence for persons convicted of first-degree mur-
der of a police officer,96 and for prison inmates convicted of murder
while serving a life sentence without possibility of parole.97 If, how-
ever, actual sentencing authority is conferred on the trial judge, then
it is not unconstitutional for a statute to require a jury to return a
non-dispositive death “sentence” upon convicting for specified crimes.98
Flaws related to those attributed to mandatory sentencing statutes
were found in a state’s structuring of its capital system to deny the
jury the option of convicting on a lesser included offense, when do-
ing so would be justified by the evidence.99 Because the jury had to
choose between conviction or acquittal, the statute created the risk
that the jury would convict because it felt the defendant deserved
to be punished or acquit because it believed death was too severe
for the particular crime, when at that stage the jury should concen-

volved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim”); Proffitt
v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 255 (1976) (upholding “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel”
aggravating circumstance as interpreted to include only “the conscienceless or piti-
less crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim”); Sochor v. Florida, 504
U.S. 527 (1992) (impermissible vagueness of “heinousness” factor cured by narrow-
ing interpretation including strangulation of a conscious victim); Arave v. Creech,
507 U.S. 463 (1993) (consistent application of narrowing construction of phrase “ex-
hibited utter disregard for human life” to require that the defendant be a “cold-
blooded, pitiless slayer” cures vagueness); Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447 (2005) (presump-
tion that state supreme court applied a narrowing construction because it had done
so numerous times).
     96 Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633 (1977) (per curiam) (involving a different

defendant from the first Roberts v. Louisiana case, 428 U.S. 325 (1976).
     97 Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U.S. 66 (1987).
     98 Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U.S. 372 (1985) (mandatory jury death sentence saved

by requirement that trial judge independently weigh aggravating and mitigating fac-
tors and determine sentence). The constitutionality of this approach has been brought
into question, however, by the Court’s decision in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002)
that a judge’s finding of facts constituting aggravating circumstances violates the
defendant’s right to trial by jury.
     99 Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980). The statute made the guilt determina-

tion “depend . . . on the jury’s feelings as to whether or not the defendant deserves
the death penalty, without giving the jury any standards to guide its decision on
this issue.” Id. at 640. Cf. Hopper v. Evans, 456 U.S. 605 (1982). No such constitu-
tional infirmity is present, however, if failure to instruct on lesser included offenses
is due to the defendant’s refusal to waive the statute of limitations for those lesser
offenses. Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447 (1984). See Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U.S.
88 (1998) (defendant charged with felony murder did not have right to instruction
as to second degree murder or manslaughter, where Nebraska traditionally did not
consider these lesser included offenses). See also Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624 (1991)
(first-degree murder defendant, who received instruction on lesser included offense
of second-degree murder, was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser in-
cluded offense of robbery). In Schad the Court also upheld Arizona’s characteriza-
tion of first degree murder as a single crime encompassing two alternatives, premedi-
tated murder and felony-murder, and not requiring jury agreement on which alternative
had occurred.
