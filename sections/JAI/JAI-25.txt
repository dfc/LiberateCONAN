may accord to aggravating and mitigating evidence.115 “The require-
ment of individualized sentencing is satisfied by allowing the jury
to consider all relevant mitigating evidence”; there is no additional
requirement that the jury be allowed to weigh the severity of an
aggravating circumstance in the absence of any mitigating fac-
tor.116 So, too, the legislature may specify the consequences of the
jury’s finding an aggravating circumstance; it may mandate that a
death sentence be imposed if the jury unanimously finds at least
one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance,117 or
if the jury finds that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigat-
ing circumstances.118 And a court may instruct that the jury “must
not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion,
prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling,” because in essence the
instruction merely cautions the jury not to base its decision “on fac-
tors not presented at the trial.” 119 However, a jury instruction that
can be interpreted as requiring jury unanimity on the existence of
each mitigating factor before that factor may be weighed against
aggravating factors is invalid as in effect allowing one juror to veto
consideration of any and all mitigating factors. Instead, each juror
must be allowed to give effect to what he or she believes to be es-
tablished mitigating evidence.120 Due process considerations can also
come into play; if the state argues for the death penalty based on
text of assessment of future dangerousness); Brewer v. Quarterman, 550 U.S. 286
(2007) (same). But cf. Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U.S. 164 (1988) (consideration of
defendant’s character as revealed by jail behavior may be limited to context of as-
sessment of future dangerousness).
     115 “Neither [Lockett nor Eddings] establishes the weight which must be given

to any particular mitigating evidence, or the manner in which it must be consid-
ered; they simply condemn any procedure in which such evidence has no weight at
all.” Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939, 961 n.2 (1983) (Justice Stevens concurring in
judgment).

     118 Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370 (1990). A court is not required give a jury

instruction expressly directing the jury to consider mitigating circumstance, as long
as the instruction actually given affords the jury the discretion to take such evi-
dence into consideration. Buchanan v. Angelone, 522 U.S. 269 (1998). By the same
token, a court did not offend the Constitution by directing the jury’s attention to a
specific paragraph of a constitutionally sufficient instruction in response to the ju-
ry’s question about proper construction of mitigating circumstances. Weeks v. Angelone,
528 U.S. 225 (2000). Nor did a court offend the Constitution by instructing the jury
to consider “[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime,”
without specifying that such circumstance need not be a circumstance of the crime,
but could include “some likelihood of future good conduct.” This was because the
jurors had heard “extensive forward-looking evidence,” and it was improbable that
they would believe themselves barred from considering it. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549
