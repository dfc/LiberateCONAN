temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixes a per-

     In Coker v. Georgia,137 the Court held that the state may not
impose a death sentence upon a rapist who did not take a human
life. In Kennedy v. Louisiana,138 the Court held that this was true
even when the rape victim was a child.139 In Coker the Court an-
nounced that the standard under the Eighth Amendment was that
punishments are barred when they “are ‘excessive’ in relation to the
crime committed. Under Gregg, a punishment is ‘excessive’ and un-
constitutional if it (1) makes no measurable contribution to accept-
able goals of punishment and hence is nothing more than the pur-
poseless and needless imposition of pain and suffering; or (2) is grossly
out of proportion to the severity of the crime. A punishment might
fail the test on either ground. Furthermore, these Eighth Amend-
ment judgments should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjec-
tive views of individual Justices; judgment should be informed by
objective factors to the maximum possible extent. To this end, atten-
tion must be given to the public attitudes concerning a particular
sentence—history and precedent, legislative attitudes, and the re-
sponse of juries reflected in their sentencing decisions are to be con-
sulted.” 140 Although the Court thought that the death penalty for
rape passed the first test (“it may measurably serve the legitimate
ends of punishment”),141 it found that it failed the second test (pro-
portionality). Georgia was the sole state providing for death for the
rape of an adult woman, and juries in at least nine out of ten cases
refused to impose death for rape. Aside from this view of public per-
ception, the Court independently concluded that death is an exces-
sive penalty for an offender who rapes but does not kill; rape can-
not compare with murder “in terms of moral depravity and of the

     137 433 U.S. 584 (1977). Justice White’s opinion was joined only by Justices Stew-

art, Blackmun, and Stevens. Justices Brennan and Marshall concurred on their view
that the death penalty is per se invalid, id. at 600, and Justice Powell concurred on
a more limited basis than Justice White’s opinion. Id. at 601. Chief Justice Burger
and Justice Rehnquist dissented. Id. at 604.

vens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Justice Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which
Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas joined.
     139 The Court noted, however, that “[o]ur concern here is limited to crimes against

individual persons [where a victim’s life is not taken]. We do not address, for ex-
ample, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug king-
pin activity, which are offenses against the State.” 128 S. Ct. at 2659.
