that it failed “to allow the particularized consideration of relevant
aspects of the character and record of each convicted defen-
dant.” 104 Lockett and Woodson have since been endorsed by a Court
majority.105 Thus, a great measure of discretion was again ac-
corded the sentencing authority, be it judge or jury, subject only to
the consideration that the legislature must prescribe aggravating
factors.106
    The Court has explained this apparent contradiction as consti-
tuting recognition that “individual culpability is not always mea-
sured by the category of crime committed,” 107 and as the product
of an attempt to pursue the “twin objectives” of “measured, consis-
tent application” of the death penalty and “fairness to the ac-
cused.” 108 The requirement that aggravating circumstances be spelled
out by statute serves a narrowing purpose that helps consistency
of application; absence of restriction on mitigating evidence helps

     104 Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303 (1976) (opinion of Justice Stew-

art, joined by Justices Powell and Stevens). Accord, Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S.
325 (1976) (statute mandating death penalty for five categories of homicide consti-
tuting first-degree murder).
     105 Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982) (adopting Lockett); Sumner

v. Shuman, 483 U.S. 66 (1987) (adopting Woodson). The majority in Eddings was
composed of Justices Powell, Brennan, Marshall, Stevens, and O’Connor; Chief Jus-
tice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist dissented. The Shuman
majority was composed of Justices Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall, Powell, Stevens,
and O’Connor; dissenting were Justices White and Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist.
Woodson and the first Roberts v. Louisiana had earlier been followed in the second
Roberts v. Louisiana, 431 U.S. 633 (1977), a per curiam opinion from which Chief
Justice Burger, and Justices Blackmun, White, and Rehnquist dissented.
     106 Justice White, dissenting in Lockett from the Court’s holding on consider-

ation of mitigating factors, wrote that he “greatly fear[ed] that the effect of the Court’s
decision today will be to compel constitutionally a restoration of the state of affairs
at the time Furman was decided, where the death penalty is imposed so erratically
and the threat of execution is so attenuated for even the most atrocious murders
that ‘its imposition would then be the pointless and needless extinction of life with
only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes.’ ” 438 U.S.
at 623. More recently, Justice Scalia voiced similar misgivings. “Shortly after intro-
ducing our doctrine requiring constraints on the sentencer’s discretion to ‘impose’
the death penalty, the Court began developing a doctrine forbidding constraints on
the sentencer ’s discretion to ‘decline to impose’ it. This second doctrine—
counterdoctrine would be a better word—has completely exploded whatever coher-
ence the notion of ‘guided discretion’ once had. . . . In short, the practice which in
Furman had been described as the discretion to sentence to death and pronounced
constitutionally prohibited, was in Woodson and Lockett renamed the discretion not
to sentence to death and pronounced constitutionally required.” Walton v. Arizona,
497 U.S. 639, 661, 662 (1990) (concurring in the judgment). For a critique of these
criticisms of Lockett, see Scott E. Sundby, The Lockett Paradox: Reconciling Guided
Discretion and Unguided Mitigation in Capital Sentencing, 38 UCLA L. REV. 1147
