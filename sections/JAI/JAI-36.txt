man, was that it was not being administered fairly—that the capital
sentencing laws vesting “practically untrammeled discretion” in ju-
ries were being used as vehicles for racial discrimination, and that
“discrimination is an ingredient not compatible with the idea of equal
protection of the laws that is implicit in the ban on ‘cruel and un-
usual’ punishments.” 173 This argument has not carried the day. Al-
though the Court has acknowledged the possibility that the death
penalty may be administered in a racially discriminatory manner,
it has made proof of such discrimination quite difficult.
    A measure of protection against jury bias was provided by the
Court’s holding that “a capital defendant accused of an interracial
crime is entitled to have prospective jurors informed of the race of
the victim and questioned on the issue of racial bias.” 174
     Proof of prosecution bias is another matter. The Court ruled in
McCleskey v. Kemp 175 that a strong statistical showing of racial dis-
parity in capital sentencing cases is insufficient to establish an Eighth
Amendment violation. Statistics alone do not establish racial dis-
crimination in any particular case, the Court concluded, but “at most
show only a likelihood that a particular factor entered into some
decisions.” 176 Just as important to the outcome, however, was the
Court’s application of the two overarching principles of prior capi-
tal punishment cases: that a state’s system must narrow a sentencer’s
discretion to impose the death penalty (e.g., by carefully defining
“aggravating” circumstances), but must not constrain a sentencer’s
discretion to consider mitigating factors relating to the character of
the defendant. Although the dissenters saw the need to narrow dis-
cretion in order to reduce the chance that racial discrimination un-
derlies jury decisions to impose the death penalty,177 the majority
emphasized the need to preserve jury discretion not to impose capi-
tal punishment. Reliance on statistics to establish a prima facie case
of discrimination, the Court feared, could undermine the require-
ment that capital sentencing jurors “focus their collective judgment
on the unique characteristics of a particular criminal defen-
dant”—a focus that can result in “final and unreviewable” leni-
ency.178
