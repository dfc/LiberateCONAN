mane to inmates generally.246 Ordinarily there is both a subjective
and an objective inquiry. Before conditions of confinement not for-
mally meted out as punishment by the statute or sentencing judge
can qualify as “punishment,” there must be a culpable, “wanton”
state of mind on the part of prison officials.247 In the context of gen-
eral prison conditions, this culpable state of mind is “deliberate in-
difference”; 248 in the context of emergency actions, e.g., actions re-
quired to suppress a disturbance by inmates, only a malicious and
sadistic state of mind is culpable.249 When excessive force is al-
leged, the objective standard varies depending upon whether that
force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore disci-
pline, or whether it was applied maliciously and sadistically to cause
harm. In the good-faith context, there must be proof of significant
injury. When, however, prison officials “maliciously and sadistically
use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency are al-
ways violated,” and there is no need to prove that “significant in-
jury” resulted.250
    Beginning with Holt v. Sarver,251 federal courts found prisons
or entire prison systems to violate the Cruel and Unusual Punish-

But even applying the Court’s flawed Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, I would draw
the line at actual, serious injuries and reject the claim that exposure to the risk of
injury can violate the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 95 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted).
     246 E.g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978).
     247 Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991).
     248 501 U.S. at 303. Deliberate indifference in this context means something more

than disregarding an unjustifiably high risk of harm that should have been known,
as might apply in the civil context. Rather, it requires a finding that the responsible
person acted in reckless disregard of a risk of which he or she was aware, as would
generally be required for a criminal charge of recklessness. Farmer v. Brennan, 511
U.S. 825 (1994). In upholding capital punishment by a three-drug lethal injection
protocol, despite the risk that the protocol will not be properly followed and conse-
quently result in severe pain, a Court plurality found that, although “subjecting in-
dividuals to a risk of future harm—not simply actually inflicting pain—can qualify
as cruel and unusual punishment . . . , the conditions presenting the risk must be
‘sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering,’ and give rise to
‘sufficiently imminent dangers.’ . . . [T]o prevail on such a claim there must be a
‘substantial risk of serious harm,’ an ‘objectively intolerable risk of harm’ that pre-
vents prison officials from pleading that they were ‘subjectively blameless for pur-
poses of the Eighth Amendment.’ ” Baze v. Rees, 128 S. Ct. 1520, 1530–31 (emphasis
added by the Court). This case is also discussed, supra, under Eighth Amendment,
“Application and Scope.”
     249 Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986) (arguably excessive force in suppress-

ing prison uprising did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment).
     250 Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 (1992) (beating of a shackled prisoner

resulted in bruises, swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate). Accord Wilkins
v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–10914, slip op. (2010) (per curiam).
     251 309 F. Supp. 362 (E.D. Ark. 1970), aff’d, 442 F.2d 304 (8th Cir. 1971) (dis-

trict court ordered to retain jurisdiction until unconstitutional conditions corrected,
505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974). The Supreme Court ultimately sustained the decisions
of the lower courts in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978)).
