insanity should be used in capital punishment cases, and what pro-
cess must be afforded to the defendant to prove his incapacity. Al-
though the court below had found that it was sufficient to establish
competency that a defendant know that he is to be executed and
the reason why, the Court in Panetti rejected these criteria, and
sent the case back to the lower court for it to consider whether the
defendant had a rational understanding of the reasons the state gave
for an execution, and how that reflected on his competency.151 The
Court also found that the failure of the state to provide the defen-
dant an adequate opportunity to respond to the findings of two court-
appointed mental health experts violated due process.152
     In 1989, when first confronted with the issue of whether execu-
tion of the mentally retarded is constitutional, the Court found “in-
sufficient evidence of a national consensus against executing men-
tally retarded people.” 153 In 2002, however, the Court determined
in Atkins v. Virginia 154 that “much ha[d] changed” since 1989, that
the practice had become “truly unusual,” and that it was “fair to
say” that a “national consensus” had developed against it.155 In 1989,
only two states and the Federal Government prohibited execution
of the mentally retarded while allowing executions generally. By 2002,
an additional 16 states had prohibited execution of the mentally re-
tarded, and no states had reinstated the power. But the important
element of consensus, the Court explained, was “not so much the
number” of states that had acted, but instead “the consistency of
the direction of change.” 156 The Court’s “own evaluation of the is-
sue” reinforced the consensus. Neither of the two generally recog-
nized justifications for the death penalty—retribution and deterrence—
applies with full force to mentally retarded offenders. Retribution
necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender, yet mental
retardation reduces culpability. Deterrence is premised on the abil-
     151 127 S. Ct. at 2862. In Panetti, the defendant, despite apparent mental prob-

lems, was found to understand both his imminent execution and the fact that the
State of Texas intended to execute him for having murdered his mother-in-law and
father-in-law. It was argued, however, that defendant, suffering from delusions, be-
lieved that the stated reason for his execution was a “sham” and that the state wanted
to execute him to “stop him from preaching.”

     153 Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 335 (1989). Although unwilling to conclude

that execution of a mentally retarded person is “categorically prohibited by the Eighth
Amendment,” id. at 335, the Court noted that, because of the requirement of indi-
vidualized consideration of culpability, a retarded defendant is entitled to an instruc-
tion that the jury may consider and give mitigating effect to evidence of retardation
or a background of abuse. Id. at 328. See also Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004)
(evidence of low intelligence should be admissible for mitigating purposes without
being screened on basis of severity of disability).
