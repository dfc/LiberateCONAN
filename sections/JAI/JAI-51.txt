ment inapplicable to the infliction of corporal punishment upon school-
children for disciplinary purposes, the Court explained that the Cruel
and Unusual Punishments Clause “circumscribes the criminal pro-
cess in three ways: First, it limits the kinds of punishment that
can be imposed on those convicted of crimes; second, it proscribes
punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime;
and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can be made crimi-
nal and punished as such.” 259 These limitations, the Court thought,
should not be extended outside the criminal process.

tional restraint on school discipline, the Court ruled, is to be found in the Due Pro-
cess Clause, if at all.
