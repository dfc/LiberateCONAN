half centuries as the basic authority.6 Darnel’s Case,7 in which the
judges permitted the continued imprisonment of persons without bail
merely upon the order of the King, was one of the moving factors
in the enactment of the Petition of Right in 1628.8 The Petition cited
the Magna Carta as proscribing the kind of detention that was per-
mitted in Darnel’s Case. The right to bail was again subverted a
half-century later by various technical subterfuges by which peti-
tions for habeas corpus could not be presented,9 and Parliament re-
acted by enacting the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679,10 which estab-
lished procedures for effectuating release from imprisonment and
provided penalties for judges who did not comply with the Act. That
avenue closed, the judges then set bail so high that it could not be
met, and Parliament responded by including in the Bill of Rights
of 1689 11 a provision “[t]hat excessive bail ought not to be re-
quired.” This language, along with essentially the rest of the pres-
ent Eighth Amendment, was included within the Virginia Declara-
tion of Rights,12 was picked up in the Virginia recommendations for
inclusion in a federal bill of rights by the state ratifying conven-
tion,13 and was introduced verbatim by Madison in the House of
Representatives.14
    Thus, in England, the right to bail generally was conferred by
the basic 1275 statute, as supplemented; the procedure for assur-
ing access to the right was conferred by the Habeas Corpus Act of
1679; and protection against abridgement through the fixing of ex-
cessive bail was conferred by the Bill of Rights of 1689. In the United
States, the Constitution protected habeas corpus in Article 1, § 9,
but did not confer a right to bail. The question is, therefore, whether
the First Congress in proposing the Bill of Rights knowingly sought
