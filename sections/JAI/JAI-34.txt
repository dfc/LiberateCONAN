forbidding imposition of capital punishment on 16- or 17-year-old
murderers, whereas there was such a consensus against execution
of 15-year-olds.163
    Although the Court in Atkins v. Virginia contrasted the na-
tional consensus said to have developed against executing the men-
tally retarded with what it saw as a lack of consensus regarding
execution of juvenile offenders over age 15,164 less than three years
later the Court held that such a consensus had developed. The Court’s
decision in Roper v. Simmons 165 drew parallels with Atkins. A con-
sensus had developed, the Court held, against the execution of ju-
veniles who were age 16 or 17 when they committed their crimes.
Since Stanford, five states had eliminated authority for executing
juveniles, and no states that formerly prohibited it had reinstated
the authority. In all, 30 states prohibited execution of juveniles: 12
that prohibited the death penalty altogether, and 18 that excluded
juveniles from its reach. This meant that 20 states did not prohibit
execution of juveniles, but the Court noted that only five of these
states had actually executed juveniles since Stanford, and only three
had done so in the 10 years immediately preceding Roper. Al-
though the pace of change was slower than had been the case with
execution of the mentally retarded, the consistent direction of change
toward abolition was deemed more important.166
    As in Atkins, the Court in Roper relied on its “own indepen-
dent judgment” in addition to its finding of consensus among the
states.167 Three general differences between juveniles and adults make
     163 Compare Thompson, 487 U.S. at 849 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (two-thirds

of all state legislatures had concluded that no one should be executed for a crime
committed at age 15, and no state had “unequivocally endorsed” a lower age limit)
with Stanford, 492 U.S. at 370 (15 of 37 states permitting capital punishment de-
cline to impose it on 16-year-old offenders; 12 decline to impose it on 17-year-old
offenders).
     164 536 U.S. at 314, n.18.
     165 543 U.S. 551 (2005). The case was decided by 5–4 vote. Justice Kennedy wrote

the Court’s opinion, and was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.
Justice O’Connor, who had joined the Court’s 6–3 majority in Atkins, wrote a dissent-
ing opinion, as did Justice Scalia, who was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and
Justice Thomas.
     166 Dissenting in Roper, Justice O’Connor disputed the consistency of the trend,

pointing out that since Stanford two states had passed laws reaffirming the permis-
sibility of executing 16- and 17-year-old offenders. 543 U.S. at 596.
     167 543 U.S. at 564. The Stanford Court had been split over the appropriate scope

of inquiry in cruel and unusual punishment cases. Justice Scalia’s plurality would
have focused almost exclusively on an assessment of what the state legislatures and
Congress have done in setting an age limit for application of capital punishment.
492 U.S. at 377 (“A revised national consensus so broad, so clear and so enduring
as to justify a permanent prohibition upon all units of democratic government must
appear in the operative acts (laws and the application of laws) that the people have
approved.”). The Stanford dissenters would have broadened this inquiry with a pro-
portionality review that considers the defendant’s culpability as one aspect of the
