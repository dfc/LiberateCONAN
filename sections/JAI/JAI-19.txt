judge,86 be given standards to govern its exercise of discretion and
be given the opportunity to evaluate both the circumstances of the
offense and the character and propensities of the accused; 87 (2) that
to prevent jury prejudice on the issue of guilt there be a separate
proceeding after conviction at which evidence relevant to the sen-
tence, mitigating and aggravating, be presented; 88 (3) that special
forms of appellate review be provided not only of the conviction but
also of the sentence, to ascertain that the sentence was fairly im-

     86 The Stewart plurality noted its belief that jury sentencing in capital cases

performs an important societal function in maintaining a link between contempo-
rary community values and the penal system, but agreed that sentencing may con-
stitutionally be vested in the trial judge. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 190 (1976).
A definitive ruling came in Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447 (1984), upholding a
provision under which the judge can override a jury’s advisory life imprisonment
sentence and impose the death sentence. “[Tlhe purpose of the death penalty is not
frustrated by, or inconsistent with, a scheme in which the imposition of the penalty
in individual cases is determined by a judge.” Id. at 462–63. Consequently, a judge
may be given significant discretion to override a jury sentencing recommendation,
as long as the court’s decision is adequately channeled to prevent arbitrary results
Harris v. Alabama, 513 U.S. 504 (1995) (Eighth Amendment not violated where judge
is only required to “consider” a capital jury’s sentencing recommendation). The Sixth
Amendment right to jury trial is violated, however, if the judge makes factual find-
ings (e.g., as to the existence of aggravating circumstances) on which a death sen-
tence is based. Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002).
     87 Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 188–95 (1976). Justice White seemed close to

the plurality on the question of standards, id. at 207 (concurring), but while Chief
Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist joined the White opinion “agreeing” that the
system under review “comports” with Furman, Justice Rehnquist denied the consti-
tutional requirement of standards in any event. Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S.
280, 319–21 (1976) (dissenting). In McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 207–08
(1971), the Court had rejected the argument that the absence of standards violated
the Due Process Clause. On the vitiation of McGautha, see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 195
n.47, and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 598–99 (1978). In assessing the character
and record of the defendant, the jury may be required to make a judgment about
the possibility of future dangerousness of the defendant, from psychiatric and other
evidence. Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 275–76 (1976). Moreover, testimony of psy-
chiatrists need not be based on examination of the defendant; general responses to
hypothetical questions may also be admitted. Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880 (1983).
But cf. Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981) (holding Self-incrimination and Coun-
sel Clauses applicable to psychiatric examination, at least when a doctor testifies
about his conclusions with respect to future dangerousness).
     88 Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 163, 190–92, 195 (1976) (plurality opinion).

McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183 (1971), had rejected a due process require-
ment of bifurcated trials, and the Gregg plurality did not expressly require it under
the Eighth Amendment. But the plurality’s emphasis upon avoidance of arbitrary
and capricious sentencing by juries seems to look inevitably toward bifurcation. The
dissenters in Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 358 (1976), rejected bifurcation and
viewed the plurality as requiring it. All states with post-Furman capital sentencing
statutes took the cue by adopting bifurcated capital sentencing procedures, and the
Court has not been faced with the issue again. See Raymond J. Pascucci, et al., Spe-
cial Project, Capital Punishment in 1984: Abandoning the Pursuit of Fairness and
Consistency, 69 CORNELL L. REV. 1129, 1224–25 (1984).
