their own judgments for the people and their elected representa-
tives. A death penalty statute, just as all other statutes, comes be-
fore the courts bearing a presumption of validity that can be over-
come only upon a strong showing by those who attack its
constitutionality. Whether in fact the death penalty validly serves
the permissible functions of retribution and deterrence, the judg-
ments of the state legislatures are that it does, and those judg-
ments are entitled to deference. Therefore, the infliction of death
as a punishment for murder is not without justification and is not
unconstitutionally severe. Nor is the punishment of death dispro-
portionate to the crime being punished, murder.83
    Second, however, a different majority concluded that statutes
mandating the imposition of death for crimes classified as first-
degree murder violate the Eighth Amendment. A review of history,
traditional usage, legislative enactments, and jury determinations
led the plurality to conclude that mandatory death sentences had
been rejected by contemporary standards. Moreover, mandatory sen-
tencing precludes the individualized “consideration of the character
and record of the . . . offender and the circumstances of the particu-
lar offense” that “the fundamental respect for humanity underlying
the Eighth Amendment” requires in capital cases.84
    A third principle established by the 1976 cases was that the pro-
cedure by which a death sentence is imposed must be structured
so as to reduce arbitrariness and capriciousness as much as pos-
sible.85 What emerged from the prevailing plurality opinion in these
cases are requirements (1) that the sentencing authority, jury or

Stevens); Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 350–56 (1976) (Justices White, Blackmun,
Rehnquist, and Chief Justice Burger). The views summarized in the text are those
in the Stewart opinion in Gregg. Justice White’s opinion basically agrees with this
opinion in concluding that contemporary community sentiment accepts capital pun-
ishment, but did not endorse the proportionality analysis. Justice White’s Furman
dissent and those of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun show a rejection of
proportionality analysis. Justices Brennan and Marshall dissented, reiterating their
Furman views. Gregg, 428 U.S. at 227, 231.
    84 Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976); Roberts v. Louisiana, 428

U.S. 325 (1976). Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens composed the plurality, and
Justices Brennan and Marshall concurred on the basis of their own views of the
death penalty. Id. at 305, 306, 336.
    85 Here adopted is the constitutional analysis of the Stewart plurality of three.

“[T]he holding of the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members
who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428
U.S. 153, 169 n.15 (1976), a comment directed to the Furman opinions but equally
applicable to these cases and to Lockett. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188,
192–94 (1977).
