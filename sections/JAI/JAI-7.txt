                              EXCESSIVE FINES
     For years the Supreme Court had little to say about excessive
fines. In an early case, it held that it had no appellate jurisdiction
to revise the sentence of an inferior court, even though the exces-
siveness of the fines was apparent on the face of the record.29 Jus-
tice Brandeis once contended in dissent that the denial of second-
class mailing privileges to a newspaper on the basis of its past conduct,
because it imposed additional mailing costs which grew day by day,
amounted to an unlimited fine that was an “unusual” and “unprec-
edented” punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.30 The
Court has elected to deal with the issue of fines levied upon indigents,
resulting in imprisonment upon inability to pay, in terms of the Equal
Protection Clause,31 thus obviating any necessity to develop the mean-
ing of “excessive fines” in relation to ability to pay. The Court has
held the clause inapplicable to civil jury awards of punitive dam-
ages in cases between private parties, “when the government nei-
ther has prosecuted the action nor has any right to receive a share
of the damages awarded.” 32 The Court based this conclusion on a
review of the history and purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause.
At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted, the Court noted,
“the word ‘fine’ was understood to mean a payment to a sovereign
as punishment for some offense.” 33 The Eighth Amendment itself,
as were antecedents of the clause in the Virginia Declaration of Rights
and in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, “clearly was adopted with
the particular intent of placing limits on the powers of the new gov-
ernment.” 34 Therefore, while leaving open the issues of whether the
clause has any applicability to civil penalties or to qui tam actions,
the Court determined that “the Excessive Fines Clause was in-
tended to limit only those fines directly imposed by, and payable
to, the government.” 35 The Court has held, however, that the Exces-
sive Fines Clause can be applied in civil forfeiture cases.36

application of the Excessive Fines Clause to civil forfeiture did not depend on whether
it was a civil or criminal procedure, but rather on whether the forfeiture could be
