of a maturing society.” 48 The proper approach to an interpretation
of this provision has been one of the major points of difference among
the Justices in the capital punishment cases.49

Application and Scope
    “Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the
extent of the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and
unusual punishments shall not be inflicted; but it is safe to affirm
that punishments of torture, such as [drawing and quartering,
embowelling alive, beheading, public dissecting, and burning alive],
and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbid-
den by that amendment to the Constitution.” 50
    In upholding capital punishment inflicted by a firing squad, the
Court not only looked to traditional practices but examined the his-
tory of executions in the territory concerned, the military practice,
and contemporaneous writings on the death penalty.51 Relying on
the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause rather than the
Eighth Amendment, the Court next approved electrocution as a per-
missible method of administering punishment.52 Many years later,
a divided Court, assuming the Eighth Amendment’s applicability to
the states, held that a second electrocution following a mechanical
failure at the first that had injured but not killed the condemned
man did not violate the proscription.53
    In Baze v. Rees,54 a Court plurality upheld capital punishment
by a three-drug lethal injection protocol, despite the risk that the
protocol will not be properly followed and that severe pain will re-

passage was later repeated, with the Court adding that cruel and unusual punish-
ment “is judged not by the standards that prevailed in 1685 . . . or when the Bill of
Rights was adopted, but rather by those that currently prevail.” Atkins v. Virginia,
536 U.S. 304, 311–12 (2002).

Unusual Punishments Clause, 126 U. PA. L. REV. 989 (1978).

     51 Hanging was the other method of execution commonly used at the time, and

implicitly approved by the Court.
     52 In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436 (1890) (“Punishments are cruel when they in-

volve torture or a lingering death; but the punishment of death is not cruel within
the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies something inhu-
man and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life,” id. at
447).
     53 Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). Justice Frank-

furter tested the issue by due process standards. Id. at 470 (concurring). Years ear-
lier the Court, although recognizing that the Eighth Amendment was then inappli-
cable to the states, opined in dictum that a fine and a brief imprisonment for illegal
sale of alcohol was not cruel and unusual punishment. Pervear v. Massachusetts, 72
U.S. (5 Wall.) 475 (1867).
