sence of written findings by the jury), the appellate court may pre-
serve a death penalty through harmless error review or through a
reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence.126 By con-
trast, where there is a possibility that the jury’s reliance on a “to-
tally irrelevant” factor (defendant had served time pursuant to an
invalid conviction subsequently vacated) may have been decisive in
balancing aggravating and mitigating factors, a death sentence may
not stand notwithstanding the presence of other aggravating fac-
tors.127
    In Oregon v. Guzek, the Court could “find nothing in the Eighth
or Fourteenth Amendments that provides a capital defendant a right
to introduce,” at sentencing, new evidence, available to him at the
time of trial, “that shows he was not present at the scene of the
crime.” 128 Although “the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments re-
quire that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as
a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record
and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant prof-
fers as a basis for a sentence less than death,” such evidence is a
traditional concern of sentencing because it tends to show “how, not
whether,” the defendant committed the crime.129 Alibi evidence, by
contrast, concerns “whether the defendant committed the basic crime,”
and “thereby attacks a previously determined matter in a proceed-
ing [i.e., sentencing] at which, in principle, that matter is not at
issue.” 130
    Focus on the character and culpability of the defendant led the
Court initially to hold that introduction of evidence about the char-
acter of the victim or the amount of emotional distress caused to
the victim’s family or community was inappropriate because it “cre-
ates an impermissible risk that the capital sentencing decision will
be made in an arbitrary manner.” 131 Changed membership on the
Court resulted in overruling of these decisions, however, and a hold-
testimony might have affected how the jury evaluated another aggravating factor.
Consequently, the reviewing court erred in reinstating a death sentence based on
this other valid aggravating factor. Tuggle v. Netherland, 516 U.S. 10 (1995).
     126 Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738 (1990). Cf. Parker v. Dugger, 498 U.S.

308 (1991) (affirmance of death sentence invalid because appellate court did not re-
weigh non-statutory mitigating evidence).
     127 Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.S. 578 (1988).
     128 546 U.S. 517, 523 (2006).
     129 546 U.S. at 524, 526 (Court’s emphasis deleted in part).
     130 546 U.S. at 526.
     131 Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496, 503 (1987). And culpability, the Court added,

“depends not on fortuitous circumstances such as the composition [or articulate-
ness] of [the] victim’s family, but on circumstances over which [the defendant] has
control.” Id. at 504 n.7. The decision was 5–4, with Justice Powell’s opinion of the
Court being joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, and with
Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, O’Connor, and Scalia dissenting. See
