parison with the penalties imposed in similar cases.89 The Court
later ruled, however, that proportionality review is not constitution-
ally required.90 Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek did not require such com-
parative proportionality review, the Court noted, but merely sug-
gested that proportionality review is one means by which a state
may “safeguard against arbitrarily imposed death sentences.” 91
    The Court added a fourth major guideline in 2002, holding that
the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury comprehends the right
to have a jury make factual determinations on which a sentencing
increase is based.92 This means that capital sentencing schemes are
unconstitutional if judges are allowed to make factual findings as
to the existence of aggravating circumstances that are prerequi-
sites for imposition of a death sentence.
    Implementation of Procedural Requirements.—Most states
responded to the 1976 requirement that the sentencing authority’s
discretion be narrowed by enacting statutes spelling out “aggravat-
ing” circumstances, and requiring that at least one such aggravat-
ing circumstance be found before the death penalty is imposed. The
Court has required that the standards be relatively precise and in-
structive so as to minimize the risk of arbitrary and capricious ac-
tion by the sentencer, the desired result being a principled way to
distinguish cases in which the death penalty should be imposed from
cases in which it should not be. Thus, the Court invalidated a capi-
tal sentence based upon a jury finding that the murder was “outra-
geously or wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman,” reasoning that
“a person of ordinary sensibility could fairly [so] characterize al-
most every murder.” 93 Similarly, an “especially heinous, atrocious,
or cruel” aggravating circumstance was held to be unconstitution-
ally vague.94 The “especially heinous, cruel, or depraved” standard
is cured, however, by a narrowing interpretation requiring a find-
ing of infliction of mental anguish or physical abuse before the vic-
tim’s death.95
