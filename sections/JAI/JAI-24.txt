promote fairness to the accused through an “individualized” consid-
eration of his circumstances. In the Court’s words, statutory aggra-
vating circumstances “play a constitutionally necessary function at
the stage of legislative definition [by] circumscribing the class of per-
sons eligible for the death penalty,” 109 while consideration of all miti-
gating evidence requires focus on “the character and record of the
individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense”
consistent with “the fundamental respect for humanity underlying
the Eighth Amendment.” 110 As long as the defendant’s crime falls
within the statutorily narrowed class, the jury may then conduct
“an individualized determination on the basis of the character of
the individual and the circumstances of the crime.” 111
    So far, the Justices who favor abandonment of the Lockett and
Woodson approach have not prevailed. The Court has, however, given
states greater leeway in fashioning procedural rules that have the
effect of controlling how juries may use mitigating evidence that
must be admitted and considered.112 States may also cure some con-
stitutional errors on appeal through operation of “harmless error”
rules and reweighing of evidence by the appellate court.113 Also, the
Court has constrained the use of federal habeas corpus to review
state court judgments. As a result of these trends, the Court recog-
nizes a significant degree of state autonomy in capital sentencing
in spite of its rulings on substantive Eighth Amendment law.
    While holding fast to the Lockett requirement that sentencers
be allowed to consider all mitigating evidence,114 the Court has up-
held state statutes that control the relative weight that the sentencer

served at the sentencing phase or at the guilt phase; the fact that an aggravating
circumstance justifying capital punishment duplicates an element of the offense of
first-degree murder does not render the procedure invalid. Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484
U.S. 231 (1988).

aggravating factor where appellate court fails to reweigh mitigating and aggravat-
