done, we ought not to be restrained from making necessary laws
by any declaration of this kind.” 42 It is clear from some of the com-
plaints about the absence of a bill of rights including a guarantee
against cruel and unusual punishments in the ratifying conven-
tions that tortures and barbarous punishments were much on the
minds of the complainants,43 but the English history which led to
the inclusion of a predecessor provision in the Bill of Rights of 1689
indicates additional concern with arbitrary and disproportionate pun-
ishments.44 Though few in number, the decisions of the Supreme
Court interpreting this guarantee have applied it in both senses.

Style of Interpretation
    At first, the Court was inclined to an historical style of interpre-
tation, determining whether a punishment was “cruel and un-
usual” by looking to see if it or a sufficiently similar variant had
been considered “cruel and unusual” in 1789.45 In Weems v. United
States,46 however, the Court concluded that the framers had not merely
intended to bar the reinstitution of procedures and techniques con-
demned in 1789, but had intended to prevent the authorization of
“a coercive cruelty being exercised through other forms of punish-
ment.” The Amendment therefore was of an “expansive and vital
character” 47 and, in the words of a later Court, “must draw its mean-
ing from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress

Meaning, 57 CALIF. L. REV. 839 (1969). Disproportionality, in any event, was used by
the Court in Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910). It is not clear what, if
anything, the word “unusual” adds to the concept of “cruelty” (but see Furman v.
Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 276 n.20 (1972) (Justice Brennan concurring)), although it
may have figured in Weems, 217 U.S. at 377, and in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100
n.32 (1958) (plurality opinion), and it did figure in Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S.
957, 994–95 (1991) (“severe, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not
unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms through-
out our Nation’s history”).

cf. Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368–72 (1910). Chief Justice Rehnquist
subscribed to this view (see, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 208 (dis-
senting)), and the views of Justices Scalia and Thomas appear to be similar. See,
e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 966–90 (1991) (Justice Scalia announcing
judgment of Court) (relying on original understanding of Amendment and of Eng-
lish practice to argue that there is no proportionality principle in non-capital cases);
and Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 28 (1992) (Justice Thomas dissenting) (object-
ing to Court’s extension of the Amendment “beyond all bounds of history and prec-
edent” in holding that “significant injury” need not be established for sadistic and
malicious beating of shackled prisoner to constitute cruel and unusual punishment).
