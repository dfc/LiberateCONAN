rule should be applied retroactively if it places ‘certain kinds of pri-
mary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal
law-making authority to proscribe.’ ” 187 The second exception has
also been stated to be “that a new rule should be applied retroac-
tively if it requires the observance of those procedures that . . . are
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ ” and “without which the
likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.” 188 Fur-
ther restricting the availability of federal habeas review is the Court’s
definition of “new rule.” Interpretations that are a logical out-
growth or application of an earlier rule are nonetheless “new rules”
unless the result was “dictated” by that precedent.189 Although in
Penry itself the Court determined that the requested rule (requir-
ing an instruction that the jury consider mitigating evidence of the
defendant’s mental retardation and abused childhood) was not a “new
rule” because it was dictated by Eddings and Lockett, in subse-
quent habeas capital sentencing cases the Court has found substan-
tive review barred by the “new rule” limitation.190

     187 Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. at 311, quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S.

667, 692 (1971). “Teague by its terms applies only to procedural rules.” Bousley v.
United States, 523 U.S. 614, 620 (1998). “New substantive rules generally apply ret-
roactively . . . because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands
convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that
the law cannot impose on him.” Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 351, 352 (2004)
(internal quotation marks omitted) (the holding of Ring v. Arizona, that “a sentenc-
ing judge, sitting without a jury [may not] find an aggravating circumstance neces-
sary for imposition of the death penalty,” 542 U.S. at 353, quoting Ring, 536 U.S. at
609, was a procedural, not a substantive rule).
     188 Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. at 311, 313, quoting Mackey v. United States, 401

U.S. at 693. The second exception was at issue in Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227
(1990), in which the Court held the exception inapplicable to the Caldwell v. Missis-
sippi rule that the Eighth Amendment is violated by prosecutorial misstatements
characterizing the jury’s role in capital sentencing as merely recommendatory. It is
“not enough,” the Court in Sawyer explained, “that a new rule is aimed at improv-
ing the accuracy of a trial. More is required. A rule that qualifies under this excep-
tion must not only improve accuracy, but also ‘alter our understanding of the bed-
rock procedural elements’ essential to the fairness of a proceeding.” Id. at 242.
     189 Penry, 492 U.S. at 314; accord, Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007).

Put another way, it is not enough that a decision is “within the ‘logical compass’ of
an earlier decision, or indeed that it is ‘controlled’ by a prior decision.” A decision
announces a “new rule” if its result “was susceptible to debate among reasonable
minds” or if it would not have been “an illogical or even a grudging application” of
the prior decision to hold it inapplicable. Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415 (1990).
     190 See, e.g., Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407 (1990) (1988 ruling in Arizona v.

Roberson, that the Fifth Amendment bars police-initiated interrogation following a
suspect’s request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation, announced a
“new rule” not dictated by the 1981 decision in Edwards v. Arizona that police must
refrain from all further questioning of an in-custody accused who invokes his right
to counsel); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484 (1990) (habeas petitioner’s request that
capital sentencing be reversed because of an instruction that the jury “avoid any
influence of sympathy” is a request for a new rule not “compel[led]” by Eddings and
Lockett, which governed what mitigating evidence a jury must be allowed to con-
sider, not how it must consider that evidence); Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227 (1990)
