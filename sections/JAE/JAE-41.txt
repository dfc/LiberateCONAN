     In a later case, the Court held that an officer may seize an ob-
ject if, in the course of a weapons frisk, “plain touch” reveals the
presence of the object, and the officer has probable cause to believe
it is contraband.206 The Court viewed the situation as analogous to
that covered by the “plain view” doctrine: obvious contraband may
be seized, but a search may not be expanded to determine whether
an object is contraband.207 Also impermissible is physical manipula-
tion, without reasonable suspicion, of a bus passenger’s carry-on lug-
gage stored in an overhead compartment.208
    Terry did not rule on a host of problems, including the grounds
that could permissibly lead an officer to momentarily stop a person
on the street or elsewhere in order to ask questions rather than
frisk for weapons, the right of the stopped individual to refuse to
cooperate, and the permissible response of the police to that re-
fusal. The Court provided a partial answer in 2004, when it upheld
a state law that required a suspect to disclose his name in the course
of a valid Terry stop.209 Questions about a suspect’s identity “are a
routine and accepted part of many Terry stops,” the Court ex-
plained.210
    After Terry, the standard for stops for investigative purposes
evolved into one of “reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.” That
test permits some stops and questioning without probable cause in
order to allow police officers to explore the foundations of their sus-
picions.211 Although it did not elaborate a set of rules to govern the
defendant was sitting in an identified parked car, visible to informer and officer, in
a high crime area at 2 a.m., with narcotics and a gun at his waist); Pennsylvania v.
Mimms, 434 U.S. 106 (1977) (after validly stopping car, officer required defendant
to get out of car, observed bulge under his jacket, and frisked him and seized weapon;
while officer did not suspect driver of crime or have an articulable basis for safety
fears, safety considerations justified his requiring driver to leave car); Maryland v.
Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 413 (1997) (after validly stopping car, officer may order pas-
sengers as well as driver out of car; “the same weighty interest in officer safety is
present regardless of whether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or passen-
ger”); Arizona v. Johnson, 129 S. Ct. 781, 786 (2009) (after validly stopping car, offi-
cer may frisk (patdown for weapons) both the driver and any passengers whom he
reasonably concludes “might be armed and presently dangerous”).
     206 Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993).
     207 508 U.S. at 375, 378–79. In Dickerson the Court held that seizure of a small

plastic container that the officer felt in the suspect’s pocket was not justified; the
officer should not have continued the search, manipulating the container with his
fingers, after determining that no weapon was present.
     208 Bond v. United States, 529 U.S. 334 (2000) (bus passenger has reasonable

expectation that, although other passengers might handle his bag in order to make
room for their own, they will not “feel the bag in an exploratory manner”).

must have “articulable reasons” or “founded suspicions,” derived from the totality of
