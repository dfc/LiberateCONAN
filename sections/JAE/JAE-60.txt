from ground-level public view is permissible, the Court finding such
spaces more analogous to open fields than to the curtilage of a dwell-
ing.319
     “Plain View”.—Somewhat similar in rationale is the rule that
objects falling in the “plain view” of an officer who has a right to be
in the position to have that view are subject to seizure without a
warrant 320 or that, if the officer needs a warrant or probable cause
to search and seize, his lawful observation will provide grounds there-
for.321 The plain view doctrine is limited, however, by the probable
cause requirement: officers must have probable cause to believe that
items in plain view are contraband before they may search or seize
them.322
    The Court has analogized from the plain view doctrine to hold
that, once officers have lawfully observed contraband, “the owner’s
privacy interest in that item is lost,” and officers may reseal a con-
tainer, trace its path through a controlled delivery, and seize and
reopen the container without a warrant.323
    Public Schools.—In New Jersey v. T.L.O.,324 the Court set forth
the principles governing searches by public school authorities. The

     319 Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227 (1986) (suggesting that aerial

photography of the curtilage would be impermissible).
     320 Washington v. Chrisman, 455 U.S. 1 (1982) (officer lawfully in dorm room

may seize marijuana seeds and pipe in open view); United States v. Santana, 427
U.S. 38 (1976) (“plain view” justification for officers to enter home to arrest after
observing defendant standing in open doorway); Harris v. United States, 390 U.S.
234 (1968) (officer who opened door of impounded automobile and saw evidence in
plain view properly seized it); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 (1963) (officers entered
premises without warrant to make arrest because of exigent circumstances seized
evidence in plain sight). Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 464–73 (1971),
and id. at 510 (Justice White dissenting). Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325 (1990)
(items seized in plain view during protective sweep of home incident to arrest); Texas
v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730 (1983) (contraband on car seat in plain view of officer who
had stopped car and asked for driver’s license); New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106
(1986) (evidence seen while looking for vehicle identification number). There is no
requirement that the discovery of evidence in plain view must be “inadvertent.” See
Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990) (in spite of Amendment’s particularity re-
quirement, officers with warrant to search for proceeds of robbery may seize weap-
ons of robbery in plain view).
     321 Steele v. United States, 267 U.S. 498 (1925) (officers observed contraband in

view through open doorway; had probable cause to procure warrant). Cf. Taylor v.
United States, 286 U.S. 1 (1932) (officers observed contraband in plain view in ga-
rage, warrantless entry to seize was unconstitutional).
     322 Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987) (police lawfully in apartment to inves-

tigate shooting lacked probable cause to inspect expensive stereo equipment to re-
cord serial numbers).
     323 Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U.S. 765, 771 (1983) (locker customs agents had opened,

and which was subsequently traced). Accord, United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S.
109 (1984) (inspection of package opened by private freight carrier who notified drug
agents).
     324 469 U.S. 325 (1985).
