    Police in undertaking a warrantless search of an automobile may
not extend the search to the persons of the passengers therein 282
unless there is a reasonable suspicion that the passengers are armed
and dangerous, in which case a Terry patdown is permissible,283 or
unless there is individualized suspicion of criminal activity by the
passengers.284 But because passengers in an automobile have no rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in the interior area of the car, a war-
rantless search of the glove compartment and the spaces under the
seats, which turned up evidence implicating the passengers, in-
vaded no Fourth Amendment interest of the passengers.285 Lug-
gage and other closed containers found in automobiles may also be
subjected to warrantless searches based on probable cause, regard-
less of whether the luggage or containers belong to the driver or to
a passenger, and regardless of whether it is the driver or a passen-
ger who is under suspicion.286 The same rule now applies whether
the police have probable cause to search only the containers 287 or
whether they have probable cause to search the automobile for some-
thing capable of being held in the container.288
    Vessel Searches.—Not only is the warrant requirement inap-
plicable to brief stops of vessels, but also none of the safeguards
applicable to stops of automobiles on less than probable cause are
necessary predicates to stops of vessels. In United States v. Villamonte-
Marquez,289 the Court upheld a random stop and boarding of a ves-
sel by customs agents, lacking any suspicion of wrongdoing, for pur-
pose of inspecting documentation. The boarding was authorized by
statute derived from an act of the First Congress,290 and hence had
“an impressive historical pedigree” carrying with it a presumption
