and the evidence to be sought.103 Although a warrant is issued ex
parte, its validity may be contested in a subsequent suppression hear-
ing if incriminating evidence is found and a prosecution is brought.104
     Issuance by Neutral Magistrate.—In numerous cases, the Court
has referred to the necessity that warrants be issued by a “judicial
officer” or a “magistrate.” 105 “The point of the Fourth Amendment,
which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies
law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reason-
able men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring
that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magis-
trate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often com-
petitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evi-
dence sufficient to support a magistrate’s disinterested determination
to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search
without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and
leave the people’s homes secure only in the discretion of police offi-
cers.” 106 These cases do not mean that only a judge or an official
who is a lawyer may issue warrants, but they do stand for two tests
of the validity of the power of the issuing party to so act. “He must
be neutral and detached, and he must be capable of determining
whether probable cause exists for the requested arrest or search.” 107
The first test cannot be met when the issuing party is himself en-
gaged in law enforcement activities,108 but the Court has not re-
quired that an issuing party have that independence of tenure and
     103 Although the exceptions may be different for arrest warrants and search war-

rants, the requirements for the issuance of the two are the same. Aguilar v. Texas,
378 U.S. 108, 112 n.3 (1964). Also, the standards by which the validity of warrants
are to be judged are the same, whether federal or state officers are involved. Ker v.
California, 374 U.S. 23 (1963).
     104 Most often, in the suppression hearings, the defendant will challenge the suf-

ficiency of the evidence presented to the magistrate to constitute probable cause.
Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969); United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573
(1971). He may challenge the veracity of the statements used by the police to pro-
cure the warrant and otherwise contest the accuracy of the allegations going to es-
tablish probable cause, but the Court has carefully hedged his ability to do so. Franks
v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). He may also question the power of the official
issuing the warrant, Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 449–53 (1971), or
the specificity of the particularity required. Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192
