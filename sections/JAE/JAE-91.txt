not violated in the seizure.484 Also, it is no longer sufficient that
one merely be lawfully on the premises in order to be able to object
to an illegal search; rather, one must show some legitimate inter-
est in the premises that the search invaded.485 The same illegal search
might, therefore, invade the rights of one person and not of an-
other.486 Again, the effect of the application of the privacy rationale
has been to narrow considerably the number of people who can com-
plain of an unconstitutional search.




      484 Previously, when ownership or possession was the issue, such as a charge of

possessing contraband, the Court accorded “automatic standing” to one on the basis,
first, that to require him to assert ownership or possession at the suppression hear-
ing would be to cause him to incriminate himself with testimony that could later be
used against him, and, second, that the government could not simultaneously assert
that defendant was in possession of the items and deny that it had invaded his in-
terests. Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261–65 (1960). See also United States
v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48 (1951). In Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968),
however, the Court held inadmissible at the subsequent trial admissions made in
suppression hearings. When it then held that possession alone was insufficient to
give a defendant the interest to move to suppress, because he must show that the
search itself invaded his interest, the second consideration was mooted as well, and
thus the “automatic standing” rule was overturned. United States v. Salvucci, 448
U.S. 83 (1980) (stolen checks found in illegal search of apartment of the mother of
the defendant, in which he had no interest; defendant could not move to suppress
on the basis of the illegal search); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98 (1980) (drugs
belonging to defendant discovered in illegal search of friend’s purse, in which he
had no privacy interest; admission of ownership insufficient to enable him to move
to suppress).
      485 Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978) (passengers in automobile had no pri-

vacy interest in interior of the car; could not object to illegal search). United States
v. Padilla, 508 U.S. 77 (1993) (only persons whose privacy or property interests are
violated may object to a search on Fourth Amendment grounds; exerting control and
oversight over property by virtue of participation in a criminal conspiracy does not
alone establish such interests). Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960), had es-
tablished the rule that anyone legitimately on the premises could object; the ratio-
nale was discarded but the result in Jones was maintained because he was there
with permission, he had his own key, his luggage was there, he had the right to
exclude and therefore a legitimate expectation of privacy. Similarly maintained were
the results in United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48 (1951) (hotel room rented by
defendant’s aunts to which he had a key and permission to store things); Mancusi v.
DeForte, 392 U.S. 364 (1968) (defendant shared office with several others; though
he had no reasonable expectation of absolute privacy, he could reasonably expect to
be intruded on only by other occupants and not by police).
      486 E.g., Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98 (1980) (fearing imminent police search,

defendant deposited drugs in companion’s purse where they were discovered in course
of illegal search; defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in her purse, so
that his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, although hers were).
