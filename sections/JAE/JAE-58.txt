States,308 the Court held that a warrantless stop and search of de-
fendant’s automobile on a highway some 20 miles from the border
by a roving patrol lacking probable cause to believe that the ve-
hicle contained illegal aliens violated the Fourth Amendment. Simi-
larly, the Court invalidated an automobile search at a fixed check-
point well removed from the border; while agreeing that a fixed
checkpoint probably gave motorists less cause for alarm than did
roving patrols, the Court nonetheless held that the invasion of pri-
vacy entailed in a search was just as intrusive and must be justi-
fied by a showing of probable cause or consent.309 On the other hand,
when motorists are briefly stopped, not for purposes of a search but
in order that officers may inquire into their residence status, either
by asking a few questions or by checking papers, different results
are achieved, so long as the stops are not truly random. Roving pa-
trols may stop vehicles for purposes of a brief inquiry, provided of-
ficers are “aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational
inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion” that
an automobile contains illegal aliens; in such a case the interfer-
ence with Fourth Amendment rights is “modest” and the law en-
forcement interests served are significant.310 Fixed checkpoints pro-
vide additional safeguards; here officers may halt all vehicles briefly
in order to question occupants even in the absence of any reason-
able suspicion that the particular vehicle contains illegal aliens.311

     308 413 U.S. 266 (1973). Justices White, Blackmun, Rehnquist, and Chief Jus-

tice Burger would have found the search reasonable upon the congressional determi-
nation that searches by such roving patrols were the only effective means to police
border smuggling. Id. at 285. Justice Powell, concurring, argued in favor of a gen-
eral, administrative warrant authority not tied to particular vehicles, much like the
type of warrant suggested for noncriminal administrative inspections of homes and
commercial establishments for health and safety purposes, id. at 275, but the Court
has not yet had occasion to pass on a specific case. See United States v. Martinez-
Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 547 n.2, 562 n.15 (1976).
     309 United States v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891 (1975).
     310 United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975). However, stopping of

defendant’s car solely because the officers observed the Mexican appearance of the
occupants was unjustified. Id. at 886. Contrast United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S.
411 (1981), and United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266 (2002), where border agents
did have grounds for reasonable suspicion that the vehicle they stopped contained
illegal aliens.
     311 United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976). The Court deemed

the intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests to be quite limited, even if officers
acted on the basis of the Mexican appearance of the occupants in referring motor-
ists to a secondary inspection area for questioning, whereas the elimination of the
practice would deny to the government its only practicable way to apprehend smuggled
aliens and to deter the practice. Similarly, outside of the border/aliens context, the
Court has upheld use of fixed “sobriety” checkpoints at which all motorists are briefly
stopped for preliminary questioning and observation for signs of intoxication. Michi-
