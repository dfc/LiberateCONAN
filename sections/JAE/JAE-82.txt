identified the basis for the exclusionary rule as the Self-
Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.438 Then, in Mapp v.
Ohio,439 the Court tied the rule strictly to the Fourth Amendment,
finding exclusion of evidence seized in violation of the Amendment
to be the “most important constitutional privilege” of the right to
be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, finding that the
rule was “an essential part of the right of privacy” protected by the
Amendment.
    “This Court has ever since [Weeks was decided in 1914] re-
quired of federal law officers a strict adherence to that command
which this Court has held to be a clear, specific, and constitution-
ally required—even if judicially implied—deterrent safeguard with-
out insistence upon which the Fourth Amendment would have been
reduced to a ‘form of words.’ ” 440 It was a necessary step in the ap-
plication of the rule to the states to find that the rule was of consti-
tutional origin rather than a result of an exercise of the Court’s
supervisory power over the lower federal courts, because the latter
could not constitutionally be extended to the state courts.441 In fact,
in Wolf v. Colorado,442 in declining to extend the exclusionary rule

States, 255 U.S. 313, 316 (1921); Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 33–34 (1925);
McGuire v. United States, 273 U.S. 95, 99 (1927). In Olmstead v. United States, 277
U.S. 438, 462 (1928), Chief Justice Taft ascribed the rule both to the Fourth and
the Fifth Amendments, while in dissent Justices Holmes and Brandeis took the view
that the Fifth Amendment was violated by the admission of evidence seized in vio-
lation of the Fourth. Id. at 469, 478–79. Justice Black was the only modern propo-
nent of this view. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 661 (1961) (concurring opinion); Coolidge
v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 493, 496–500 (1971) (dissenting opinion). See, how-
ever, Justice Clark’s plurality opinion in Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 30 (1963), in
which he brought up the self-incrimination clause as a supplementary source of the
rule, a position which he had discarded in Mapp.
     439 367 U.S. 643, 656 (1961). Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 28 (1949), also as-

cribed the rule to the Fourth Amendment exclusively.
     440 Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 648 (1961) (emphasis added).
     441 An example of an exclusionary rule not based on constitutional grounds may

be found in McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332 (1943), and Mallory v. United
States, 354 U.S. 449 (1957), in which the Court enforced a requirement that ar-
restees be promptly presented to a magistrate by holding that incriminating admis-
sions obtained during the period beyond a reasonable time for presentation would
be inadmissible. The rule was not extended to the States, cf. Culombe v. Connecti-
cut, 367 U.S. 568, 598–602 (1961), but the Court’s resort to the self-incrimination
clause in reviewing confessions made such application irrelevant in most cases in
any event. For an example of a transmutation of a supervisory rule into a constitu-
tional rule, see McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459 (1969), and Boykin v. Ala-
bama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969).
     442 Weeks “was not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amend-

ment . . . . The decision was a matter of judicial implication.” 338 U.S. 25, 28 (1949).
Justice Black was more explicit. “I agree with what appears to be a plain implica-
tion of the Court’s opinion that the federal exclusionary rule is not a command of
the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress
might negate.” Id. at 39–40. He continued to adhere to the supervisory power basis
