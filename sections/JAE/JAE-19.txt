or probable cause in the absence of a warrant.82 But, in 1967, the
Court in two cases held that administrative inspections to detect
building code violations must be undertaken pursuant to warrant
if the occupant objects.83 “We may agree that a routine inspection
of the physical condition of private property is a less hostile intru-
sion than the typical policeman’s search for the fruits and instru-
mentalities of crime. . . . But we cannot agree that the Fourth Amend-
ment interests at stake in these inspection cases are merely
‘peripheral.’ It is surely anomalous to say that the individual and
his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment
only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.” 84 Cer-
tain administrative inspections used to enforce regulatory schemes
with regard to such items as alcohol and firearms are, however, ex-
empt from the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement and may
be authorized simply by statute.85
    Camara and See were reaffirmed in Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc.,86
in which the Court held to violate the Fourth Amendment a provi-
sion of the Occupational Safety and Health Act that authorized fed-
eral inspectors to search the work area of any employment facility
covered by the Act for safety hazards and violations of regulations,
without a warrant or other legal process. The liquor and firearms
exceptions were distinguished on the basis that those industries had
a long tradition of close government supervision, so that a person
in those businesses gave up his privacy expectations. But OSHA
was a relatively recent statute and it regulated practically every
business in or affecting interstate commerce; it was not open to a
legislature to extend regulation and then follow it with warrant-
less inspections. Additionally, OSHA inspectors had unbounded dis-
cretion in choosing which businesses to inspect and when to do so,
leaving businesses at the mercy of possibly arbitrary actions and
certainly with no assurances as to limitation on scope and stan-

     85 Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. 72 (1970); United States

v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311 (1972). Colonnade, involving liquor, was based on the long
history of close supervision of the industry. Biswell, involving firearms, introduced
factors that were subsequently to prove significant. Thus, although the statute was
of recent enactment, firearms constituted a pervasively regulated industry, so that
dealers had no reasonable expectation of privacy, because the law provides for regu-
lar inspections. Further, warrantless inspections were needed for effective enforce-
ment of the statute.
     86 436 U.S. 307 (1978). Dissenting, Justice Stevens, with Justices Rehnquist and

Blackmun, argued that not the warrant clause but the reasonableness clause should
govern administrative inspections. Id. at 325.
