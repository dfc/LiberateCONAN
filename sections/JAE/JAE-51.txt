vehicle because its function is transportation and it seldom serves
as one’s residence or as the repository of personal effects. . . . It
travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its con-
tents are in plain view.’ ” 264 Although motor homes serve as resi-
dences and as repositories for personal effects, and their contents
are often shielded from public view, the Court extended the automo-
bile exception to them as well, holding that there is a diminished
expectation of privacy in a mobile home parked in a parking lot
and licensed for vehicular travel, hence “readily mobile.” 265
    The reduced expectancy concept has broadened police powers
to conduct automobile searches without warrants, but they still must
have probable cause to search a vehicle 266 and they may not make
random stops of vehicles on the roads, but instead must base stops
of individual vehicles on probable cause or some “articulable and
reasonable suspicion” 267 of traffic or safety violation or some other
criminal activity.268 If police stop a vehicle, then the vehicle’s pas-
sengers as well as its driver are deemed to have been seized from

     265 California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386, 393 (1985) (leaving open the question of

whether the automobile exception also applies to a “mobile” home being used as a
residence and not “readily mobile”).

An automobile’s “ready mobility [is] an exigency sufficient to excuse failure to ob-
tain a search warrant once probable cause is clear”; there is no need to find the
presence of “unforeseen circumstances” or other additional exigency. Pennsylvania v.
Labron, 527 U.S. 465 (1996). Accord, Maryland v. Dyson, 527 U.S. 465 (1999) (per
curiam). Cf. Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–817, slip op. (2013).
     267 Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 663 (1979) (discretionary random stops of

motorists to check driver’s license and automobile registration constitute Fourth Amend-
ment violation); United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975) (violation for
roving patrols on lookout for illegal aliens to stop vehicles on highways near inter-
national borders when only ground for suspicion is that occupants appear to be of
Mexican ancestry). But cf. United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266 (2002) (reasonable
suspicion justified stop by border agents of vehicle traveling on unpaved backroads
in an apparent effort to evade a border patrol checkpoint on the highway). In Prouse,
the Court cautioned that it was not precluding the states from developing methods
for spot checks, such as questioning all traffic at roadblocks, that involve less intru-
sion or that do not involve unconstrained exercise of discretion. 440 U.S. at 663.
     268 An officer who observes a traffic violation may stop a vehicle even if his real

motivation is to investigate for evidence of other crime. Whren v. United States, 517
U.S. 806 (1996). The existence of probable cause to believe that a traffic violation
has occurred establishes the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops regardless
of the actual motivation of the officers involved, and regardless of whether it is cus-
tomary police practice to stop motorists for the violation observed. Similarly, pretextual
arrest of a motorist who has committed a traffic offense is permissible. Arkansas v.
Sullivan, 532 U.S. 769 (2001) (per curiam) (upholding search of the motorist’s car
for a crime not related to the traffic offense).
