    Although the statute did not authorize a search but instead com-
pelled the production of documents, the Justice concluded that the
law was well within the restrictions of the Search and Seizure
Clause.161 With this point established, the Justice relied on Lord
Camden’s opinion in Entick v. Carrington 162 for the proposition that
seizure of items to be used as evidence only was impermissible. Jus-
tice Bradley announced that the “essence of the offence” committed
by the government against Boyd “is not the breaking of his doors,
and the rummaging of his drawers . . . but it is the invasion of his
indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private
property. . . . Breaking into a house and opening boxes and draw-
ers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compul-
sory extortion of a man’s own testimony or of his private papers to
be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods,
is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.” 163
    Although it may be doubtful that the equation of search war-
rants with subpoenas and other compulsory process ever really
amounted to much of a limitation,164 the Court currently dispenses
with any theory of “convergence” of the two amendments.165 Thus,
in Andresen v. Maryland,166 police executed a warrant to search de-
fendant’s offices for specified documents pertaining to a fraudulent
sale of land, and the Court sustained the admission of the papers
discovered as evidence at his trial. The Fifth Amendment was inap-
plicable, the Court held, because there had been no compulsion of
defendant to produce or to authenticate the documents.167 As for
the Fourth Amendment, because the “business records” seized were
evidence of criminal acts, they were properly seizable under the rule
of Warden v. Hayden; the fact that they were “testimonial” in na-
ture (records in the defendant’s handwriting) was irrelevant.168 Ac-
knowledging that “there are grave dangers inherent in executing a
warrant authorizing a search and seizure of a person’s papers,” the
Court observed that, although some “innocuous documents” would
have to be examined to ascertain which papers were to be seized,
authorities, just as with electronic “seizures” of telephone conversa-
