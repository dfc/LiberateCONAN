ing a traffic accident, the Court observing the routine nature of the
test and the minimal intrusion into bodily privacy.432
    Then, in Mapp v. Ohio,433 the Court held that the exclusionary
rule applied to the states. It was “logically and constitutionally nec-
essary,” wrote Justice Clark for the majority, “that the exclusion doc-
trine—an essential part of the right to privacy—be also insisted upon
as an essential ingredient of the right” to be secure from unreason-
able searches and seizures. “To hold otherwise is to grant the right
but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.” 434 The Court
further held that, because illegally seized evidence was to be ex-
cluded from both federal and state courts, the standards by which
the question of legality was to be determined should be the same,
regardless of whether the court in which the evidence was offered
was state or federal.435
    The Foundations of the Exclusionary Rule.—Important to
determination of such questions as the application of the exclusion-
ary rule to the states and the ability of Congress to abolish or to
limit it is the fixing of the constitutional source and the basis of
the rule. For some time, it was not clear whether the exclusionary
rule was derived from the Fourth Amendment, from some union of
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, or from the Court’s supervisory
power over the lower federal courts. It will be recalled that in Boyd 436
the Court fused the search and seizure clause with the provision of
the Fifth Amendment protecting against compelled self-incrimination.
In Weeks v. United States,437 though the Fifth Amendment was men-
tioned, the holding seemed clearly to be based on the Fourth Amend-
ment. Nevertheless, in opinions following Weeks the Court clearly
     432 Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (1957). Chief Justice Warren and Jus-

tices Black and Douglas dissented. Though a due process case, the results of the
case have been reaffirmed directly in a Fourth Amendment case. Schmerber v. Cali-
fornia, 384 U.S. 757 (1966).
     433 367 U.S. 643 (1961).
     434 367 U.S. at 655–56. Justice Black concurred, doubting that the Fourth Amend-

ment itself compelled adoption of an exclusionary rule but relying on the Fifth Amend-
ment for authority. Id. at 661. Justice Stewart would not have reached the issue but
would have reversed on other grounds, id. at 672, while Justices Harlan, Frank-
furter, and Whittaker dissented, preferring to adhere to Wolf. Id. at 672. Justice Har-
lan advocated the overruling of Mapp down to the conclusion of his service on the
Court. See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 490 (1971) (concurring opin-
ion).
     435 Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 (1963).
     436 Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886).
     437 232 U.S. 383 (1914). Defendant’s room had been searched and papers seized

by officers acting without a warrant. “If letters and private documents can thus be
seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the
protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such
searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned,
might as well be stricken from the Constitution.” Id. at 393.
