more needed in “national security cases” than in cases of “ordi-
nary” crime, the Justice continued, because the tendency of govern-
ment so often is to regard opponents of its policies as a threat and
hence to tread in areas protected by the First Amendment as well
as by the Fourth.401 Rejected also was the argument that courts
could not appreciate the intricacies of investigations in the area of
national security or preserve the secrecy which is required.402
    The question of the scope of the President’s constitutional pow-
ers, if any, remains judicially unsettled.403 Congress has acted, how-
ever, providing for a special court to hear requests for warrants for
electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence situations, and permit-
ting the President to authorize warrantless surveillance to acquire
foreign intelligence information provided that the communications
to be monitored are exclusively between or among foreign powers
and there is no substantial likelihood any “United States person”
will be overheard.404

Enforcing the Fourth Amendment: The Exclusionary Rule
    The Fourth Amendment declares a right to be free from unrea-
sonable searches and seizures, but how this right translates into
concrete terms is not specified. Several possible methods of enforce-
ment have been suggested, but only one—the exclusionary rule—
has been applied with any frequency by the Supreme Court, and
Court in recent years has limited its application.
    Alternatives to the Exclusionary Rule.—Theoretically, there
are several alternatives to the exclusionary rule. An illegal search
and seizure may be criminally actionable and officers undertaking
one thus subject to prosecution, but the examples when officers are
criminally prosecuted for overzealous law enforcement are ex-

may be that Congress, for example, would judge that the application and affidavit
showing probable cause need not follow the exact requirements of § 2518 but should
allege other circumstances more appropriate to domestic security cases. . . .” 407
