tions, “must take care to assure that [searches] are conducted in a
manner that minimizes unwarranted intrusions upon privacy.” 169
     Although Andresen was concerned with business records, its dis-
cussion seemed equally applicable to “personal” papers, such as dia-
ries and letters, as to which a much greater interest in privacy ex-
ists. The question of the propriety of seizure of such papers continues
to be the subject of reservation in opinions,170 but it is far from clear
that the Court would accept any such exception should the issue
be presented.171
     Execution of Warrants.—The Fourth Amendment’s “general
touchstone of reasonableness . . . governs the method of execution
of the warrant.” 172 Until recently, however, most such issues have
been dealt with by statute and rule.173 It was a rule at common
law that before an officer could break and enter he must give no-
tice of his office, authority, and purpose and must in effect be re-
fused admittance,174 and until recently this has been a statutory
requirement in the federal system 175 and generally in the states.
In Ker v. California,176 the Court considered the rule of announce-
ment as a constitutional requirement, although a majority there found
circumstances justifying entry without announcement.
     In Wilson v. Arkansas,177 the Court determined that the com-
mon law “knock and announce” rule is an element of the Fourth
Amendment reasonableness inquiry. The rule is merely a presump-
tion, however, that yields under various circumstances, including
those posing a threat of physical violence to officers, those in which

proved to be a significant limitation. Scott v. United States, 425 U.S. 917 (1976).

States, 425 U.S. 391, 401 (1976); California Bankers Ass’n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21,

     173 Rule 41(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provides, inter alia, that

the warrant shall command its execution in the daytime, unless the magistrate “for
reasonable cause shown” directs in the warrant that it be served at some other time.

     176 374 U.S. 23 (1963). Ker was an arrest warrant case, but no reason appears

for differentiating search warrants. Eight Justices agreed that federal standards should
govern and that the rule of announcement was of constitutional stature, but they
divided 4-to-4 whether entry in this case had been pursuant to a valid exception.
Justice Harlan who had dissented from the federal standards issue joined the four
finding a justifiable exception to carry the result.
