by the officer himself.136 Nor may a warrant issue based “solely on
the conclusory assertions of the police officer without any inquiry
by the [magistrate] into the factual basis for the officer’s conclu-
sions.” 137 Instead, a warrant must be “supported by affidavits set-
ting forth specific facts in order that the issuing magistrate may
‘focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.’ ” 138 This does not
mean, however, that a higher standard of probable cause is re-
quired in order to obtain a warrant to seize materials protected by
the First Amendment. “Our reference in Roaden to a ‘higher hurdle
. . . of reasonableness’ was not intended to establish a ‘higher’ stan-
dard of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to seize books
or films, but instead related to the more basic requirement, im-
posed by that decision, that the police not rely on the ‘exigency’ ex-
ception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, but in-
stead obtain a warrant from a magistrate . . . .’ ” 139
    In Stanford v. Texas,140 the Court voided a seizure of more than
2,000 books, pamphlets, and other documents pursuant to a war-
rant that merely authorized the seizure of books, pamphlets, and
other written instruments “concerning the Communist Party of Texas.”
“[T]he constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly
describe the ‘things to be seized’ is to be accorded the most scrupu-
lous exactitude when the ‘things’ are books, and the basis for their
seizure is the ideas which they contain. . . . No less a standard could
be faithful to First Amendment freedoms.” 141
    However, the First Amendment does not bar the issuance or ex-
ecution of a warrant to search a newsroom to obtain photographs
of demonstrators who had injured several policemen, although the
Court appeared to suggest that a magistrate asked to issue such a
warrant should guard against interference with press freedoms through
limits on type, scope, and intrusiveness of the search.142

442 U.S. 319 (1979); Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649 (1980). These special
constraints are inapplicable when obscene materials are purchased, and there is con-
sequently no Fourth Amendment search or seizure. Maryland v. Macon, 472 U.S.

searches and seizures not only of the news media and news people but also of oth-
