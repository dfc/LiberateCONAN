the danger he poses to others, his flight risk, and so on.347 By com-
parison, the Court characterized an arrestee’s expectation of pri-
vacy as diminished and the intrusion posed by a cheek swab as mini-
mal.348
    Searches of prison cells by prison administrators are not lim-
ited even by a reasonableness standard, the Court’s having held that
“the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches
does not apply within the confines of the prison cell.” 349 Thus, prison
administrators may conduct random “shakedown” searches of in-
mates’ cells without the need to adopt any established practice or
plan, and inmates must look to the Eighth Amendment or to state
tort law for redress against harassment, malicious property destruc-
tion, and the like.
    Neither a warrant nor probable cause is needed for an adminis-
trative search of a probationer’s home. It is enough, the Court ruled
in Griffin v. Wisconsin, that such a search was conducted pursuant
to a valid regulation that itself satisfies the Fourth Amendment’s
reasonableness standard (e.g., by requiring “reasonable grounds” for
a search).350 “A State’s operation of a probation system, like its op-
eration of a school, government office or prison, or its supervision
of a regulated industry, . . . presents ‘special needs’ beyond normal
law enforcement that may justify departures from the usual war-
rant and probable cause requirements.” 351 “Probation, like incar-
ceration, is a form of criminal sanction,” the Court noted, and a
warrant or probable cause requirement would interfere with the “on-
going [non-adversarial] supervisory relationship” required for proper
functioning of the system.352 A warrant is also not required if the
purpose of a search of a probationer is investigate a crime rather
than to supervise probation.353

    348  569 U.S. ___, No. 12–207, slip op. at 23–26. The four-Justice dissent insisted
that the primary purpose of the DNA testing was investigative, not administrative,
and that the testing could not be upheld as a search incident to arrest because it
was not aimed at detection of contraband or weapons or of evidence relevant to the
crime of arrest. 569 U.S. ___, No. 12–207, Slip op. (Scalia, J., dissenting). Rather,
the dissent regarded the testing as a general effort, without individualized suspi-
cion, to see if the arrestee is connected to any unsolved crimes.
