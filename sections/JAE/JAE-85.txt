dence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall
not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all.” 455
    Although the exclusionary rule has not been completely repudi-
ated, its use has been substantially curbed. For instance, defen-
dants who themselves were not subjected to illegal searches and
seizures may not object to the introduction of evidence illegally ob-
tained from co-conspirators or codefendants,456 and even a defen-
dant whose rights have been infringed may find the evidence admit-
ted, not as proof of guilt, but to impeach his testimony.457 Further,
evidence obtained through a wrongful search and seizure may some-
times be used directly in the criminal trial, if the prosecution can
show a sufficient attenuation of the link between police misconduct
and obtaining the evidence.458 Defendants who have been con-
victed after trials in which they were given a full and fair opportu-
nity to raise claims of Fourth Amendment violations may not sub-

    456  E.g., Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978); United States v. Padilla, 508 U.S.
77 (1993) (only persons whose privacy or property interests are violated may object
to a search on Fourth Amendment grounds; exerting control and oversight over prop-
erty by virtue of participation in a criminal conspiracy does not alone establish such
interests); United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83 (1980); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448
U.S. 98 (1980). In United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727 (1980), the Court held it
impermissible for a federal court to exercise its supervisory power to police the ad-
ministration of justice in the federal system to suppress otherwise admissible evi-
dence on the ground that federal agents had flagrantly violated the Fourth Amend-
ment rights of third parties in order to obtain evidence to use against others when
the agents knew that the defendant would be unable to challenge their conduct un-
der the Fourth Amendment.
     457 United States v. Havens, 446 U.S. 620 (1980); Walder v. United States, 347

U.S. 62 (1954). Cf. Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20 (1925) (now vitiated by
Havens). The impeachment exception applies only to the defendant’s own testimony,
and may not be extended to use illegally obtained evidence to impeach the testi-
mony of other defense witnesses. James v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 307 (1990).
     458 Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487–88 (1963); Alderman v. United

States, 394 U.S. 165, 180–85 (1969); Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); Taylor v.
Alabama, 457 U.S. 687 (1982). United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U.S. 268 (1978), re-
fused to exclude the testimony of a witness discovered through an illegal search.
Because a witness was freely willing to testify and therefore more likely to come
forward, the application of the exclusionary rule was not to be tested by the stan-
dard applied to exclusion of inanimate objects. Deterrence would be little served and
relevant and material evidence would be lost to the prosecution. In New York v. Har-
ris, 495 U.S. 14 (1990), the Court refused to exclude a station-house confession made
by a suspect whose arrest at his home had violated the Fourth Amendment be-
cause, even though probable cause had existed, no warrant had been obtained. And,
in Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984), evidence seized pursuant to a war-
rant obtained after an illegal entry was admitted because there had been an inde-
pendent basis for issuance of the warrant. This rule also applies to evidence ob-
served in plain view during the initial illegal search. Murray v. United States, 487
U.S. 533 (1988). See also United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984) (excluding con-
sideration of tainted evidence, there was sufficient untainted evidence in affidavit to
justify finding of probable cause and issuance of search warrant).
