most important of which is the claim of good faith.413 Such “good
faith” claims, however, are not based on the subjective intent of the
officer. Instead, officers are entitled to qualified immunity “where
clearly established law does not show that the search violated the
Fourth Amendment,” 414 or where they had an objectively reason-
able belief that a warrantless search later determined to violate the
Fourth Amendment was supported by probable cause or exigent cir-
cumstances.415 On the practical side, persons subjected to illegal ar-
rests and searches and seizures are often disreputable persons to-
ward whom juries are unsympathetic, or they are indigent and unable
to sue. The result, therefore, is that the Court has emphasized ex-
clusion of unconstitutionally seized evidence in subsequent crimi-
nal trials as the only effective enforcement method.
    Development of the Exclusionary Rule.—Exclusion of evi-
dence as a remedy for Fourth Amendment violations found its be-
ginning in Boyd v. United States,416 which, as noted above, in-
volved not a search and seizure but a compulsory production of
business papers, which the Court likened to a search and seizure.
Further, the Court analogized the Fifth Amendment’s self-
incrimination provision to the Fourth Amendment’s protections to
derive a rule that required exclusion of the compelled evidence be-
cause the defendant had been compelled to incriminate himself by

     413 This is the rule in actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S.

547 (1967), and on remand in Bivens the court of appeals promulgated the same
rule to govern trial of the action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed-
eral Bureau of Narcotics, 456 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir. 1972).
     414 Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. ___, No. 07–751, slip op. (2009), quoted in Saf-

ford Unified School District #1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. ___, No. 08–479, slip op. at 11
(2009). In Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001), the Court had mandated a two-step
procedure to determine whether an officer has qualified immunity: first, a determi-
nation whether the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right, and then a deter-
mination whether the right had been clearly established. In Pearson, the Court held
“that, while the sequence set forth [in Saucier] is often appropriate, it should no
longer be regarded as mandatory. The judges of the district courts and the courts of
appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of
the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light
of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.” 555 U.S. ___, No. 07–751, slip
op. at 10. See also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).
     415 Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987). The qualified immunity inquiry

“has a further dimension” beyond what is required in determining whether a police
officer used excessive force in arresting a suspect: the officer may make “a reason-
able mistake” in his assessment of what the law requires. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.
194, 205–06 (2001). See also Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 201 (2004) (because
cases create a “hazy border between excessive and acceptable force,” an officer’s mis-
understanding as to her authority to shoot a suspect attempting to flee in a vehicle
was not unreasonable); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 345 (1986) (qualified immu-
nity protects police officers who applied for a warrant unless “a reasonably well-
trained officer in [the same] position would have known that his affidavit failed to
establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for a warrant”).
