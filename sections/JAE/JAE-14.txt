on individual privacy grow more extensive,54 the Court’s solicitude
for law enforcement objectives frequently tilts the balance in the
other direction.
     Application of this balancing test, because of the Court’s weigh-
ing of law enforcement investigative needs,55 and its subjective evalu-
ation of privacy needs, has led to the creation of a two-tier or sliding-
tier scale of privacy interests. The privacy test was originally designed
to permit a determination that an interest protected by the Fourth
Amendment had been invaded.56 If it had been, then ordinarily a
warrant was required, subject only to the narrowly defined excep-
tions, and the scope of the search under those exceptions was “strictly
tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initia-
tion permissible.” 57 But the Court now uses the test to determine
whether the interest invaded is important or persuasive enough so
that a warrant is required to justify it; 58 if the individual has a
lesser expectation of privacy, then the invasion may be justified, ab-
sent a warrant, by the reasonableness of the intrusion.59 Excep-
tions to the warrant requirement are no longer evaluated solely by
the justifications for the exception, e.g., exigent circumstances, and
the scope of the search is no longer tied to and limited by the justi-

ing).
     55 E.g., Robbins v. California, 453 U.S. 420, 429, 433–34 (1981) (Justice Powell

concurring), quoted with approval in United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 815–16 &

     58 The prime example is the home, so that for entries either to search or to ar-

rest, “the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.
Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed with-
out a warrant.” Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 590 (1980); Steagald v. United
States, 451 U.S. 204, 212 (1981); Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U.S. 635 (2002) (per curiam).
See also Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385 (1978). Privacy in the home is not limited
to intimate matters. “In the home all details are intimate details, because the en-
tire area is held safe from prying government eyes.” Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S.
27, 37 (2001).
     59 One has a diminished expectation of privacy in automobiles. Arkansas v. Sand-

ers, 442 U.S. 753, 761 (1979) (collecting cases); United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798,
804–09 (1982). A person’s expectation of privacy in personal luggage and other closed
containers is substantially greater than in an automobile, United States v. Chadwick,
433 U.S. 1, 13 (1977); Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753 (1979), although, if the
luggage or container is found in an automobile as to which there exists probable
cause to search, the legitimate expectancy diminishes accordingly. United States v.
Ross, supra. There is also a diminished expectation of privacy in a mobile home parked
in a parking lot and licensed for vehicular travel. California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386
(1985) (leaving open the question of whether the automobile exception also applies
to a “mobile” home being used as a residence and not adapted for immediate vehicu-
lar use).
