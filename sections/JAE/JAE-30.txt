a warrant is required, and additional safeguards may be required
for large-scale seizures. Thus, in Marcus v. Search Warrant,131 the
seizure of 11,000 copies of 280 publications pursuant to warrant is-
sued ex parte by a magistrate who had not examined any of the
publications but who had relied on the conclusory affidavit of a po-
liceman was voided. Failure to scrutinize the materials and to par-
ticularize the items to be seized was deemed inadequate, and it was
further noted that police “were provided with no guide to the exer-
cise of informed discretion, because there was no step in the proce-
dure before seizure designed to focus searchingly on the question
of obscenity.” 132 A state procedure that was designed to comply with
Marcus by the presentation of copies of books to be seized to the
magistrate for his scrutiny prior to issuance of a warrant was none-
theless found inadequate by a plurality of the Court, which con-
cluded that “since the warrant here authorized the sheriff to seize
all copies of the specified titles, and since [appellant] was not af-
forded a hearing on the question of the obscenity even of the seven
novels [seven of 59 listed titles were reviewed by the magistrate]
before the warrant issued, the procedure was . . . constitutionally
deficient.” 133
     Confusion remains, however, about the necessity for and the char-
acter of prior adversary hearings on the issue of obscenity. In a later
decision the Court held that, with adequate safeguards, no pre-
seizure adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity is required if
the film is seized not for the purpose of destruction as contraband
(the purpose in Marcus and A Quantity of Books), but instead to
preserve a copy for evidence.134 It is constitutionally permissible to
seize a copy of a film pursuant to a warrant as long as there is a
prompt post-seizure adversary hearing on the obscenity issue. Un-
til there is a judicial determination of obscenity, the Court advised,
the film may continue to be exhibited; if no other copy is available
either a copy of it must be made from the seized film or the film
itself must be returned.135
    The seizure of a film without the authority of a constitutionally
sufficient warrant is invalid; seizure cannot be justified as inciden-
tal to arrest, as the determination of obscenity may not be made

rather than all copies of allegedly obscene movies should have been seized pursuant
to warrant.
