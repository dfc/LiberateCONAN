claring his right to be secured against such searches and seizures
is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might
as well be stricken from the Constitution. The efforts of the courts
and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy
as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great prin-
ciples established by years of endeavor and suffering which have
resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.” 421
    Because the Fourth Amendment does not restrict the actions of
state officers,422 there was originally no question about the applica-
tion of an exclusionary rule in state courts 423 as a mandate of fed-
eral constitutional policy.424 But, in Wolf v. Colorado,425 a unani-
mous Court held that freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures
was such a fundamental right as to be protected against state vio-
lations by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment.426 However, the Court held that the right thus guaranteed
did not require that the exclusionary rule be applied in the state
courts, because there were other means to observe and enforce the
right. “Granting that in practice the exclusion of evidence may be
an effective way of deterring unreasonable searches, it is not for

    422  Smith v. Maryland, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 71, 76 (1855); National Safe Deposit
Co. v. Stead, 232 U.S. 58, 71 (1914).
     423 The history of the exclusionary rule in the state courts was surveyed by Jus-

tice Frankfurter in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 29, 33–38 (1949). The matter was
canvassed again in Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 224–32 (1960).
     424 During the period in which the Constitution did not impose any restrictions

on state searches and seizures, the Court permitted the introduction in evidence in
federal courts of items seized by state officers which had they been seized by federal
officers would have been inadmissible, Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 398
(1914), so long as no federal officer participated in the search, Byars v. United States,
273 U.S. 28 (1927), or the search was not made on behalf of federal law enforce-
ment purposes. Gambino v. United States, 275 U.S. 310 (1927). This rule became
known as the “silver platter doctrine” after the phrase coined by Justice Frank-
furter in Lustig v. United States, 338 U.S. 74, 78–79 (1949): “The crux of that doc-
trine is that a search is a search by a federal official if he had a hand in it; it is not
a search by a federal official if evidence secured by state authorities is turned over
to the federal authorities on a silver platter.” In Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S.
206 (1960), the doctrine was discarded by a five-to-four majority, which held that,
because Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949), had made state searches and seizures
subject to federal constitutional restrictions through the Fourteenth Amendment’s
due process clause, the “silver platter doctrine” was no longer constitutionally vi-
able. During this same period, since state courts were free to admit any evidence no
matter how obtained, evidence illegally seized by federal officers could be used in
state courts, Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U.S. 381 (1961), although the Supreme Court
ruled out such a course if the evidence had first been offered in a federal trial and
had been suppressed. Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214 (1956).
     425 338 U.S. 25 (1949).
     426 “The security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police—

which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment—is basic to a free society. It is there-
fore implicit in ‘the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the
States through the Due Process Clause.” 338 U.S. at 27–28.
