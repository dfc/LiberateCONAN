    Narrowing Application of the Exclusionary Rule.—For as
long as we have had the exclusionary rule, critics have attacked it,
challenged its premises, disputed its morality.449 By the early 1980s,
a majority of Justices had stated a desire either to abolish the rule
or to sharply curtail its operation,450 and numerous opinions had
rejected all doctrinal bases other than deterrence.451 At the same
time, these opinions voiced strong doubts about the efficacy of the
rule as a deterrent, and advanced public interest values in effec-
tive law enforcement and public safety as reasons to discard the
rule altogether or curtail its application.452 Thus, the Court empha-
sized the high costs of enforcing the rule to exclude reliable and
trustworthy evidence, even when violations have been technical or
in good faith, and suggested that such use of the rule may well “gen-
erat[e] disrespect for the law and administration of justice,” 453 as
well as free guilty defendants.454 No longer does the Court declare
that “[t]he essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evi-

      449 Among the early critics were Judge Cardozo, People v. Defore, 242 N.Y. 13,

21, 150 N.E. 585, 587 (1926) (the criminal will go free “because the constable has
blundered”), and Dean Wigmore. 8 J. WIGMORE, A TREATISE ON THE ANGLO-AMERICAN SYS-
TEM OF EVIDENCE 2183–84 (3d ed. 1940). For extensive discussion of criticism and sup-
port, with citation to the literature, see 1 WAYNE R. LAFAVE, SEARCH AND SEIZURE: A
TREATISE ON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT § 1.2 (4th ed. 2004).
      450 E.g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 496 (1976) (Chief Justice Burger: rule

ought to be discarded now, rather than wait for a replacement as he argued earlier);
id. at 536 (Justice White: modify rule to admit evidence seized illegally but in good
faith); Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 261 (1973) (Justice Powell); Brown
v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 609 (1975) (Justice Powell); Robbins v. California, 453 U.S.
420, 437 (1981) (Justice Rehnquist); California v. Minjares, 443 U.S. 916 (1979) (Jus-
tice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger); Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403
U.S. 443, 510 (1971) (Justice Blackmun joining Justice Black’s dissent that “the Fourth
Amendment supports no exclusionary rule”).
      451 E.g., United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 446 (1976) (deterrence is the “prime

purpose” of the rule, “if not the sole one.”); United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338,
347–48 (1974); United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S. 531, 536–39 (1975); Stone v. Pow-
ell, 428 U.S. 465, 486 (1976); Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 134 n.3, 137–38 (1978);
Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 38 n.3 (1979). Thus, admission of the fruits of
an unlawful search or seizure “work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong,” the wrong
being “fully accomplished by the unlawful search or seizure itself,” United States v.
Calandra, 414 U.S. at 354, and the exclusionary rule does not “cure the invasion of
the defendant’s rights which he has already suffered.” Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. at
540 (Justice White dissenting). “Judicial integrity” is not infringed by the mere ad-
mission of evidence seized wrongfully. “[T]he courts must not commit or encourage
violations of the Constitution,” and the integrity issue is answered by whether exclu-
sion would deter violations by others. United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. at 458 n.35;
United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. at 347, 354; United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S.
at 538; Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 450 n.25 (1974).
      452 United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 448–54 (1976), contains a lengthy re-

view of the literature on the deterrent effect of the rule and doubts about that ef-
fect. See also Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 492 n.32 (1976).
      453 Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. at 490, 491.

Justice Burger dissenting).
