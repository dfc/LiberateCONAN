be obtained through the warrant process or without a warrant where
“special needs” of government are shown.154
    However, some medically assisted bodily intrusions have been
held impermissible, e.g., forcible administration of an emetic to in-
duce vomiting,155 and surgery under general anesthetic to remove
a bullet lodged in a suspect’s chest.156 Factors to be weighed in de-
termining which medical tests and procedures are reasonable in-
clude the extent to which the procedure threatens the individual’s
safety or health, “the extent of the intrusion upon the individual’s
dignitary interests in personal privacy and bodily integrity,” and the
importance of the evidence to the prosecution’s case.157
    In Warden v. Hayden,158 Justice Brennan for the Court cau-
tioned that the items there seized were not “ ‘testimonial’ or ‘com-
municative’ in nature, and their introduction therefore did not com-
pel respondent to become a witness against himself in violation of
the Fifth Amendment. . . . This case thus does not require that we
consider whether there are items of evidential value whose very na-
ture precludes them from being the object of a reasonable search
and seizure.” This merging of Fourth and Fifth Amendment consid-
erations derived from Boyd v. United States,159 the first case in which
the Supreme Court considered at length the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment. Boyd was a quasi-criminal proceeding for the forfei-
ture of goods alleged to have been imported in violation of law, and
concerned a statute that authorized court orders to require defen-
dants to produce any document that might “tend to prove any alle-
gation made by the United States.” 160 The entire Court agreed that
there was a self-incrimination problem, but Justice Bradley for a
majority of the Justices also used the Fourth Amendment.

     154 Another important result of Warden v. Hayden is that third parties not sus-

pected of culpability in crime are subject to the issuance and execution of warrants
for searches and seizures of evidence. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 553–60
(1978). Justice Stevens argued for a stiffer standard for issuance of warrants to
nonsuspects, requiring in order to invade their privacy a showing that they would
not comply with a less intrusive method, such as a subpoena. Id. at 577 (dissent-
ing).
     155 Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).
     156 Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985).
     157 Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 761–63 (1985). Chief Justice Burger concurred

on the basis of his reading of the Court’s opinion “as not preventing detention of an
individual if there are reasonable grounds to believe that natural bodily functions
will disclose the presence of contraband materials secreted internally.” Id. at 767.
Cf. United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985).
     158 387 U.S. 294, 302–03 (1967). Seizure of a diary was at issue in Hill v. Cali-

fornia, 401 U.S. 797, 805 (1971), but it had not been raised in the state courts and
was deemed waived.
     159 116 U.S. 616 (1886).
