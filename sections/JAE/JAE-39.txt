“exceptional,” 194 it appears that the greater number of searches, as
well as the vast number of arrests, take place without warrants.
The Reporters of the American Law Institute Project on a Model
Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure have noted “their conviction that,
as a practical matter, searches without warrant and incidental to
arrest have been up to this time, and may remain, of greater prac-
tical importance” than searches pursuant to warrants. “[T]he evi-
dence on hand . . . compel[s] the conclusion that searches under
warrants have played a comparatively minor part in law enforce-
ment, except in connection with narcotics and gambling laws.” 195
Nevertheless, the Court frequently asserts that “the most basic con-
stitutional rule in this area is that ‘searches conducted outside the
judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are
per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to
a few specially established and well-delineated exceptions.’ ” 196 The
exceptions are said to be “jealously and carefully drawn,” 197 and
there must be “a showing by those who seek exemption . . . that
the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.” 198 Al-
though the record indicates an effort to categorize the exceptions,
the number and breadth of those exceptions have been growing.
     Detention Short of Arrest: Stop and Frisk.—Arrests are sub-
ject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, but the courts
have followed the common law in upholding the right of police offi-
cers to take a person into custody without a warrant if they have
probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has commit-
ted a felony or a misdemeanor in their presence.199 Probable cause
is, of course, the same standard required to be met in the issuance
of an arrest warrant, and must be satisfied by conditions existing
prior to the police officer’s stop, what is discovered thereafter not

gard to exceptions to the warrant clause, conduct must be tested by the reasonable-
ness standard enunciated by the first clause of the Amendment, Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1, 20 (1968). The Court’s development of its privacy expectation tests, dis-
cussed under “The Interest Protected,” supra, substantially changed the content of
that standard.
