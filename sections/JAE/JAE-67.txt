nificant element” in Vernonia the fact that the policy was imple-
mented under the government’s responsibilities as guardian and tu-
tor of schoolchildren.367
    Seven years later, the Court in Board of Education v. Earls 368
extended Vernonia to uphold a school system’s drug testing of all
junior high and high school students who participated in extra-
curricular activities. The lowered expectation of privacy that ath-
letes have “was not essential” to the decision in Vernonia, Justice
Thomas wrote for a 5–4 Court majority.369 Rather, that decision “de-
pended primarily upon the school’s custodial responsibility and au-
thority.” 370 Another distinction was that, although there was some
evidence of drug use among the district’s students, there was no
evidence of a significant problem, as there had been in Vernonia.
Rather, the Court referred to “the nationwide epidemic of drug use,”
and stated that there is no “threshold level” of drug use that need
be present.371 Because the students subjected to testing in Earls
had the choice of not participating in extra-curricular activities rather
than submitting to drug testing, the case stops short of holding that
public school authorities may test all junior and senior high school
students for drugs. Thus, although the Court’s rationale seems broad
enough to permit across-the-board testing,372 Justice Breyer’s con-
currence, emphasizing among other points that “the testing pro-
gram avoids subjecting the entire school to testing,” 373 raises some
doubt on this score. The Court also left another basis for limiting
the ruling’s sweep by asserting that “regulation of extracurricular
activities further diminishes the expectation of privacy among school-
children.” 374

    367  515 U.S. at 665.
    368  536 U.S. 822 (2002).
     369 536 U.S. at 831.
     370 536 U.S. at 831.
     371 536 U.S. at 836.
     372 Drug testing was said to be a “reasonable” means of protecting the school

board’s “important interest in preventing and deterring drug use among its stu-
dents,” and the decision in Vernonia was said to depend “primarily upon the school’s
custodial responsibility and authority.” 536 U.S. at 838, 831.
     373 Concurring Justice Breyer pointed out that the testing program “preserves

an option for a conscientious objector,” who can pay a price of nonparticipation that
is “serious, but less severe than expulsion.” 536 U.S. at 841. Dissenting Justice Ginsburg
pointed out that extracurricular activities are “part of the school’s educational pro-
gram” even though they are in a sense “voluntary.” “Voluntary participation in ath-
letics has a distinctly different dimension” because it “expose[s] students to physical
risks that schools have a duty to mitigate.” Id. at 845, 846.
     374 536 U.S. at 831–32. The best the Court could do to support this statement

was to assert that “some of these clubs and activities require occasional off-campus
travel and communal undress,” to point out that all extracurricular activities “have
their own rules and requirements,” and to quote from general language in Vernonia.
