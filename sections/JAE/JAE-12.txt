    Katz’s focus on privacy was revitalized in Kyllo v. United States,44
in which the Court invalidated the warrantless use of a thermal
imaging device directed at a private home from a public street. The
rule devised by the Court to limit police use of new technology that
can “shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy” is that “obtaining by
sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior
of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without
physical ‘intrusion into a constitutionally protected area’ . . . consti-
tutes a search—at least where (as here) the technology in question
is not in general public use.” 45 Relying on Katz, the Court rejected
as “mechanical” the Government’s attempted distinction between off-
the-wall and through-the-wall surveillance. Permitting all off-the-
wall observations, the Court observed, “would leave the home-
owner at the mercy of advancing technology—including technology
that could discern all human activity in the home.”
    Although the sanctity of the home has been strongly reaf-
firmed, protection of privacy in other contexts becomes more prob-
lematic. A two-part test that Justice Harlan suggested in Katz of-
ten provides the starting point for analysis.46 The first element, the
“subjective expectation” of privacy, has largely dwindled as a viable
standard, because, as Justice Harlan noted in a subsequent case,
“our expectations, and the risks we assume, are in large part reflec-
tions of laws that translate into rules the customs and values of
the past and present.” 47 As for the second element, whether one
has a “legitimate” expectation of privacy that society finds “reason-
able” to recognize, the Court has said that “[l]egitimation of expec-
tations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth


moval of a mobile home in the course of an eviction from a mobile home park). The
reasonableness of a seizure, however, is an additional issue that may still hinge on
privacy interests. United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 120–21 (1984) (DEA agents
reasonably seized package for examination after private mail carrier had opened the
damaged package for inspection, discovered presence of contraband, and informed
agents).
     44 533 U.S. 27 (2001).
     45 533 U.S. at 34.
     46 Justice Harlan’s opinion has been much relied upon. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio,

392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968); Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143–144 n.12 (1978); Smith v.
Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740–41 (1979); United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 91–92
(1980); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 105–06 (1980); Bond v. United States,
529 U.S. 334, 338 (2000).
     47 United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, 786 (1971). See Smith v. Maryland, 442

U.S. 735, 740 n.5 (1979) (government could not condition “subjective expectations”
by, say, announcing that henceforth all homes would be subject to warrantless en-
try, and thus destroy the “legitimate expectation of privacy”).
