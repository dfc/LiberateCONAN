fication for the exception.60 The result has been a considerable ex-
pansion, beyond what existed prior to Katz, of the power of police
and other authorities to conduct searches.
    In United States v. Jones 61 the Court seemed to revitalize the
significance of governmental trespass in determining whether a search
has occurred, suggesting that an expectation-of-privacy analysis is
needed only where no such trespass is at issue. In Jones, the Court
considered whether the attachment of a Global-Position-System de-
vice to a car used by a suspected narcotics dealer, and the monitor-
ing of such device for twenty-eight days, constituted a search for
purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Justice Scalia, writing for the
Court, found that the attachment of the device to the car repre-
sented a physical intrusion on private property, and thus obviated
the need for an expectation-of-privacy analysis.62 While this hold-
ing meant that the Court did not rule on the constitutional signifi-
cance of long-term governmental monitoring of a defendant’s move-
ments without trespass (such as might occur by tracking a cell phone),
a different majority appears prepared to find a search in those cir-
cumstances.63
    Arrests and Other Detentions.—That the Fourth Amend-
ment was intended to protect against arbitrary arrests as well as
against unreasonable searches was early assumed by Chief Justice
Marshall 64 and is now established law.65 At common law, warrant-
less arrests of persons who had committed a breach of the peace or

      60 E.g., Texas v. White, 423 U.S. 67 (1975) (if probable cause to search automo-

bile existed at scene, it can be removed to station and searched without warrant);
United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973) (once an arrest has been validly made,
search pursuant thereto is so minimally intrusive in addition that scope of search is
not limited by necessity of security of officer); United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S.
800 (1974) (incarcerated suspect; officers need no warrant to take his clothes for test
because little additional intrusion). But see Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979)
(officers on premises to execute search warrant of premises may not without more
search persons found on premises).

      62 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–1259, slip op. at 3–7. Justice Scalia reprised his physi-

cal trespass analysis in Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. ___, No. 11–564, slip op. (2013)
(police use of drug-sniffing dog on the front porch of a house based on month-old
anonymous tip). Emphasizing the primacy of the home among constitutionally pro-
tected areas, Justice Scalia reviewed the law of trespass and concluded that there is
no implied license, under customary community practice, for police to mount a porch
to conduct a drug sniff by a trained canine. Any implied license for the public to
approach a house is limited not only to specific areas, but also to specific purposes,
according to Justice Scalia. Four dissenting Justices disagreed with this last point,
and further concluded that the Katz “reasonable expectation of privacy” test was no
bar. 569 U.S. ___, No. 11–564, slip op. (2013) (Alito, J., dissenting).
