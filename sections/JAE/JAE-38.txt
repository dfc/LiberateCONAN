     Limits on detention incident to a search under these circum-
stances were addressed in Bailey v. United States.188 The police ob-
tained a warrant to search Bailey’s residence for firearms and drugs.
Meanwhile, detectives surreptitiously staked out the residence, saw
Bailey leave and drive away, and then called in a search team. While
the search was proceeding, the detectives tailed Bailey about a mile
before stopping and detaining him. A six-Justice majority held that
the detention was not constitutionally sustainable under Sum-
mers.189 According to the Court, application of the categorical excep-
tion to probable cause requirements for detention incident to a search
is determined by spatial proximity, that is, whether to occupant is
found “within the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched,” 190
and not by temporal proximity, that is, whether the occupant is de-
tained “as soon as reasonably practicable” consistent with safety and
security.
     The law enforcement interests that justify detention pending a
search also may justify the use of “reasonable force,” including hand-
cuffs, to effectuate a detention.191 Also, under some circumstances,
officers may search premises on the mistaken but reasonable belief
that the premises are described in an otherwise valid warrant.192
     Although, for purposes of execution, as for many other matters,
there is little difference between search warrants and arrest war-
rants, one notable difference is that the possession of a valid arrest
warrant cannot authorize authorities to enter the home of a third
party looking for the person named in the warrant; in order to do
that, they need a search warrant signifying that a magistrate has
determined that there is probable cause to believe the person named
is on the premises.193

Valid Searches and Seizures Without Warrants
   Although the Supreme Court stresses the importance of war-
rants and has repeatedly referred to searches without warrants as

    189 As an alternative ground, the district court had found that stopping Bailey
was lawful as an investigatory stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968), but
the Supreme Court offered no opinion on whether, assuming the stop was valid un-
der Terry, the resulting interaction between law enforcement and Bailey could inde-
pendently have justified Bailey’s detention. 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–770, slip op. at 14
(2013).

handcuffed detainee about her immigration status).

was only one “third floor apartment” in city row house when in fact there were two).

sary and sufficient authority to enter a suspect’s home to arrest him. Payton v. New
York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980).
