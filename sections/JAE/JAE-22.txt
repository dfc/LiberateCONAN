    In other contexts, the Court has also elaborated the constitu-
tional requirements affecting administrative inspections and searches.
In Michigan v. Tyler,95 for example, it subdivided the process by
which an investigation of the cause of a fire may be conducted. En-
try to fight the fire is, of course, an exception based on exigent cir-
cumstances, and no warrant or consent is needed; fire fighters on
the scene may seize evidence relating to the cause under the plain
view doctrine. Additional entries to investigate the cause of the fire
must be made pursuant to warrant procedures governing adminis-
trative searches. Evidence of arson discovered in the course of such
an administrative inspection is admissible at trial, but if the inves-
tigator finds probable cause to believe that arson has occurred and
requires further access to gather evidence for a possible prosecu-
tion, he must obtain a criminal search warrant.96
    One curious case has approved a system of “home visits” by wel-
fare caseworkers, in which the recipients are required to admit the
worker or lose eligibility for benefits.97 In another unusual case, the
Court held that a sheriff ’s assistance to a trailer park owner in dis-
connecting and removing a mobile home constituted a “seizure” of
the home.98
   In addition, there are now a number of situations, some of them
analogous to administrative searches, where “ ‘special needs’ be-
yond normal law enforcement . . . justify departures from the usual
warrant and probable cause requirements.” 99 In one of these cases
    95  436 U.S. 499 (1978).
    96  The Court also held that, after the fire was extinguished, if fire investigators
were unable to proceed at the moment, because of dark, steam, and smoke, it was
proper for them to leave and return at daylight without any necessity of complying
with its mandate for administrative or criminal warrants. 436 U.S. at 510–11. But
cf. Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U.S. 287 (1984) (no such justification for search of pri-
vate residence begun at 1:30 p.m. when fire had been extinguished at 7 a.m.).
     97 Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309 (1971). It is not clear what rationale the ma-

jority used. It appears to have proceeded on the assumption that a “home visit” was
not a search and that the Fourth Amendment does not apply when criminal prosecu-
tion is not threatened. Neither premise is valid under Camara and its progeny, al-
though Camara preceded Wyman. Presumably, the case would today be analyzed
under the expectation of privacy/need/structural protection theory of the more re-
cent cases.
     98 Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 61 (1992) (home “was not only seized, it

literally was carried away, giving new meaning to the term ‘mobile home’ ”).
     99 City of Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–1332, slip op. (2010) (reasonable-

ness test for obtaining and reviewing transcripts of on-duty text messages of police
officer using government-issued equipment); Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873
(1987) (administrative needs of probation system justify warrantless searches of pro-
bationers’ homes on less than probable cause); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526
(1984) (no Fourth Amendment protection from search of prison cell); New Jersey v.
T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985) (simple reasonableness standard governs searches of stu-
dents’ persons and effects by public school authorities); O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S.
