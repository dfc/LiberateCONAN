arrested for a serious crime.26 The majority insisted testing was con-
ducted to ensure that suspects were properly identified and pro-
cessed for detention. A skeptical dissent maintained that the test-
ing was intended to further investigative, not administrative, ends.
And, in the dissent’s opinion, a general investigative purpose to pos-
sibly link a suspect to unrelated unsolved crimes was an illegiti-
mate fishing expedition.27
     There has been some other loosening of a warrant requirement
in the law enforcement context, where search by warrant is still
the general rule. For example, the scope of a valid search “incident
to arrest,” once limited to areas within the immediate reach of the
arrested suspect, was expanded to a “protective sweep” of the en-
tire home, if arresting officers have a “reasonable” belief that the
home harbors an individual who may pose a danger.28 In another
case, the Court shifted focus from whether exigent circumstances 29
justified failure to obtain a warrant, to whether an officer had a
“reasonable” belief that an exception to the warrant requirement
applied.30 The Court has also held that an exigent circumstances
exception applied even where the exigency arose as a result of po-
lice conduct, so long as the police conduct was “reasonable” in that
it neither threatened to nor violated the Fourth Amendment.31
     Another matter of scope that the Court has addressed is the
category of persons protected by the Fourth Amendment; i.e., who
constitutes “the people.” This phrase, the Court determined, “refers
to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who
have otherwise developed sufficient connection with [the United States]
to be considered part of that community.” 32 The Fourth Amend-
ment therefore does not apply to the search and seizure by United
States agents of property that is owned by a nonresident alien and
located in a foreign country. The community of protected people in-
cludes U.S. citizens who go abroad, and aliens who have volun-
tarily entered U.S. territory and developed substantial connections
