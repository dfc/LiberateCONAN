of constitutionality. Moreover, “important factual differences be-
tween vessels located in waters offering ready access to the open
sea and automobiles on principal thoroughfares in the border area”
justify application of a less restrictive rule for vessel searches. The
reason why random stops of vehicles have been held impermissible
under the Fourth Amendment, the Court explained, is that stops
at fixed checkpoints or roadblocks are both feasible and less sub-
ject to abuse of discretion by authorities. “But no reasonable claim
can be made that permanent checkpoints would be practical on wa-
ters such as these where vessels can move in any direction at any
time and need not follow established ‘avenues’ as automobiles must
do.” 291 Because there is a “substantial” governmental interest in en-
forcing documentation laws, “especially in waters where the need
to deter or apprehend smugglers is great,” the Court found the “lim-
ited” but not “minimal” intrusion occasioned by boarding for docu-
mentation inspection to be reasonable.292 Dissenting Justice Bren-
nan argued that the Court for the first time was approving “a
completely random seizure and detention of persons and an entry
onto private, noncommercial premises by police officers, without any
limitations whatever on the officers’ discretion or any safeguards
against abuse.” 293
    Consent Searches.—Fourth Amendment rights, like other con-
stitutional rights, may be waived, and one may consent to a search
of his person or premises by officers who have not complied with
the Amendment.294 The Court, however, has insisted that the bur-
den is on the prosecution to prove the voluntariness of the con-
sent 295 and awareness of the right of choice.296 Reviewing courts
must determine on the basis of the totality of the circumstances
whether consent has been freely given or has been coerced. Actual
knowledge of the right to refuse consent is not essential for a search

was feasible in this case, involving a ship channel in an inland waterway. Id. at 608
n.10. The fact that the Court’s rationale was geared to the difficulties of law enforce-
ment in the open seas suggests a reluctance to make exceptions to the general rule.
Note as well the Court’s later reference to this case as among those “reflect[ing]
longstanding concern for the protection of the integrity of the border.” United States

quired some “discretion-limiting” feature such as a requirement of probable cause,
reasonable suspicion, fixed checkpoints instead of roving patrols, and limitation of
border searches to border areas, and that these principles set forth in Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), should govern. Id. at 599, 601.
