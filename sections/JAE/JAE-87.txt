     The most severe curtailment of the rule came in 1984 with the
adoption of a “good faith” exception. In United States v. Leon,466 the
Court created an exception for evidence obtained as a result of offi-
cers’ objective, good-faith reliance on a warrant, later found to be
defective, issued by a detached and neutral magistrate. Justice White’s
opinion for the Court could find little benefit in applying the exclu-
sionary rule where there has been good-faith reliance on an invalid
warrant. Thus, there was nothing to offset the “substantial social
costs exacted by the [rule].” 467 “The exclusionary rule is designed
to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges
and magistrates,” and in any event the Court considered it un-
likely that the rule could have much deterrent effect on the actions
of truly neutral magistrates.468 Moreover, the Court thought that
the rule should not be applied “to deter objectively reasonable law
enforcement activity,” and that “[p]enalizing the officer for the mag-
istrate’s error . . . cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of
Fourth Amendment violations.” 469 The Court also suggested some
circumstances in which courts would be unable to find that officers’
reliance on a warrant was objectively reasonable: if the officers have
been “dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit,” if it should
have been obvious that the magistrate had “wholly abandoned” his
neutral role, or if the warrant was obviously deficient on its face
(e.g., lacking in particularity).
    The Court applied the Leon standard in Massachusetts v. Shep-
pard,470 holding that an officer possessed an objectively reasonable
belief that he had a valid warrant after he had pointed out to the
magistrate that he had not used the standard form, and the magis-
trate had indicated that the necessary changes had been incorpo-
rated in the issued warrant. Then, the Court then extended Leon
to hold that the exclusionary rule is inapplicable to evidence ob-
tained by an officer acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a
statute later held to violate the Fourth Amendment.471 Justice
Blackmun’s opinion for the Court reasoned that application of the
exclusionary rule in such circumstances would have no more deter-
     466 468 U.S. 897 (1984). The same objectively reasonable “good-faith” rule now

applies in determining whether officers obtaining warrants are entitled to qualified
immunity from suit. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986).
     467 468 U.S. at 907.
     468 468 U.S. at 916–17.
     469 468 U.S. at 919, 921.
     470 468 U.S. 981 (1984).
     471 Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987). The same difficult-to-establish qualifi-

cations apply: there can be no objectively reasonable reliance “if, in passing the stat-
ute, the legislature wholly abandoned its responsibility to enact constitutional laws,”
or if “a reasonable officer should have known that the statute was unconstitu-
tional.” Id. at 355.
