    Until relatively recently, the legality of arrests was seldom liti-
gated in the Supreme Court because of the rule that a person de-
tained pursuant to an arbitrary seizure—unlike evidence obtained
as a result of an unlawful search—remains subject to custody and
presentation to court.77 But the application of self-incrimination and
other exclusionary rules to the states and the heightening of their
scope in state and federal cases alike brought forth the rule that
verbal evidence, confessions, and other admissions, like all deriva-
tive evidence obtained as a result of unlawful seizures, could be ex-
cluded.78 Thus, a confession made by one illegally in custody must
be suppressed, unless the causal connection between the illegal ar-
rest and the confession had become so attenuated that the latter
should not be deemed “tainted” by the former.79 Similarly, finger-
prints and other physical evidence obtained as a result of an unlaw-
ful arrest must be suppressed.80
    Searches and Inspections in Noncriminal Cases.—Certain
early cases held that the Fourth Amendment was applicable only
when a search was undertaken for criminal investigatory pur-
poses,81 and the Supreme Court until recently employed a reason-
ableness test for such searches without requiring either a warrant

     77 Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436, 440 (1886); see also Albrecht v. United States,

273 U.S. 1 (1927); Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519 (1952).
     78 Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963). Such evidence is the “fruit

of the poisonous tree,” Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341 (1939), that is,
evidence derived from the original illegality. Previously, if confessions were volun-
tary for purposes of the self-incrimination clause, they were admissible notwithstand-
ing any prior official illegality. Colombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568 (1961).
     79 Although there is a presumption that the illegal arrest is the cause of the

subsequent confession, the presumption is rebuttable by a showing that the confes-
sion is the result of “an intervening . . . act of free will.” Wong Sun v. United States,
371 U.S. 471, 486 (1963). The factors used to determine whether the taint has been
dissipated are the time between the illegal arrest and the confession, whether there
were intervening circumstances (such as consultation with others, Miranda warn-
ings, etc.), and the degree of flagrancy and purposefulness of the official conduct.
Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975) (Miranda warnings alone insufficient); Dunaway
v. New York, 442 U.S. 200 (1979); Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687 (1982); Kaupp v.
Texas, 538 U.S. 626 (2003). In Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356 (1972), the fact
that the suspect had been taken before a magistrate who advised him of his rights
and set bail, after which he confessed, established a sufficient intervening circum-
stance.
     80 Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969); Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687

(1982). In United States v. Crews, 445 U.S. 463 (1980), the Court, unanimously but
for a variety of reasons, held proper the identification in court of a defendant, who
had been wrongly arrested without probable cause, by the crime victim. The court
identification was not tainted by either the arrest or the subsequent in-custody iden-
tification. See also Hayes v. Florida, 470 U.S. 811, 815 (1985), suggesting in dictum
that a “narrowly circumscribed procedure for fingerprinting detentions on less than
probable cause” may be permissible.
