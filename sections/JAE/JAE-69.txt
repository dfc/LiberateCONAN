not render the evidence excludable, since the exclusionary rule op-
erated only on evidence seized in violation of the Constitution.379
    Federal Communications Act.—Six years after the decision
in Olmstead, Congress enacted the Federal Communications Act and
included in § 605 of the Act a broadly worded proscription on which
the Court seized to place some limitation upon governmental wire-
tapping.380 Thus, in Nardone v. United States,381 the Court held that
wiretapping by federal officers could violate § 605 if the officers both
intercepted and divulged the contents of the conversation they over-
heard, and that testimony in court would constitute a form of pro-
hibited divulgence. Such evidence was therefore excluded, although
wiretapping was not illegal under the Court’s interpretation if the
information was not used outside the governmental agency. Be-
cause § 605 applied to intrastate as well as interstate transmis-
sions,382 there was no question about the applicability of the ban to
state police officers, but the Court declined to apply either the stat-
ute or the due process clause to require the exclusion of such evi-



     379 Among the dissenters were Justice Holmes, who characterized “illegal” wire-

tapping as “dirty business,” 277 U.S. at 470, and Justice Brandeis, who contributed
to his opinion the famous peroration about government as “the potent, the omnipres-
ent, teacher” which “breeds contempt for law” among the people by its example. Id.
at 485. More relevant here was his lengthy argument rejecting the premises of the
majority, an argument which later became the law of the land. (1) “To protect [the
right to be left alone], every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the
privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a viola-
tion of the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 478. (2) “There is, in essence, no difference
between the sealed letter and the private telephone message. . . . The evil incident
to invasion of the privacy of the telephone is far greater than that involved in tam-
pering with the mails. Whenever a telephone line is tapped, the privacy of the per-
sons at both ends of the line is invaded and all conversations between them upon
any subject . . . may be overheard.” Id. at 475–76.
     380 Ch. 652, 48 Stat. 1103 (1934), providing, inter alia, that “. . . no person not

being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or
publish the existence, contents, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted com-
munication to any person.” Nothing in the legislative history indicated what Con-
gress had in mind in including this language. The section, which appeared at 47
U.S.C. § 605, was rewritten by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968, 82 Stat.
22, § 803, so that the “regulation of the interception of wire or oral communications
in the future is to be governed by” the provisions of Title III. S. REP. NO. 1097, 90th
Cong., 2d Sess. 107–08 (1968).
     381 302 U.S. 379 (1937). Derivative evidence, that is, evidence discovered as a

result of information obtained through a wiretap, was similarly inadmissible, Nardone
v. United States, 308 U.S. 338 (1939), although the testimony of witnesses might be
obtained through the exploitation of wiretap information. Goldstein v. United States,
316 U.S. 114 (1942). Eavesdropping on a conversation on an extension telephone
with the consent of one of the parties did not violate the statute. Rathbun v. United
States, 355 U.S. 107 (1957).
     382 Weiss v. United States, 308 U.S. 321 (1939).
