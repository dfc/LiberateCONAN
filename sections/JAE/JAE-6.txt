cases. It is a dispute that has run most consistently throughout the
cases involving the scope of the right to search incident to arrest.12
Although the right to search the person of the arrestee without a
warrant is unquestioned, how far afield into areas within and with-
out the control of the arrestee a search may range is an interesting
and crucial matter.
    The Court has drawn a wavering line.13 In Harris v. United
States,14 it approved as “reasonable” the warrantless search of a four-
room apartment pursuant to the arrest of the man found there. A
year later, however, a reconstituted Court majority set aside a con-
viction based on evidence seized by a warrantless search pursuant
to an arrest and adopted the “cardinal rule that, in seizing goods
and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search
warrants wherever reasonably practicable.” 15 This rule was set aside
two years later by another reconstituted majority, which adopted
the premise that the test “is not whether it is reasonable to pro-
cure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.”
Whether a search is reasonable, the Court said, “must find resolu-
tion in the facts and circumstances of each case.” 16 However, the
Court soon returned to its emphasis upon the warrant. “The [Fourth]
Amendment was in large part a reaction to the general warrants
and warrantless searches that had so alienated the colonists and
had helped speed the movement for independence. In the scheme
of the Amendment, therefore, the requirement that ‘no Warrants
shall issue, but upon probable cause,’ plays a crucial part.” 17 There-
fore, “the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judi-
cial approval of searches and seizures through a warrant proce-


den v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967); but see id. at 303 (reserving the question whether
“there are items of evidential value whose very nature precludes them from being
the object of a reasonable search and seizure.”)
     12 Approval of warrantless searches pursuant to arrest first appeared in dicta

in several cases. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392 (1914); Carroll v. United
States, 267 U.S. 132, 158 (1925); Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30 (1925).
Whether or not there is to be a rule or a principle generally preferring or requiring
searches pursuant to warrant to warrantless searches, however, has ramifications
far beyond the issue of searches pursuant to arrest. United States v. United States
District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 320 (1972).
