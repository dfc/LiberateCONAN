guarantee of salary that characterizes federal judges.109 And, in pass-
ing on the second test, the Court has been essentially pragmatic in
assessing whether the issuing party possesses the capacity to deter-
mine probable cause.110
    Probable Cause.—The concept of “probable cause” is central
to the meaning of the warrant clause. Neither the Fourth Amend-
ment nor the federal statutory provisions relevant to the area de-
fine “probable cause”; the definition is entirely a judicial construct.
An applicant for a warrant must present to the magistrate facts
sufficient to enable the officer himself to make a determination of
probable cause. “In determining what is probable cause . . . [w]e
are concerned only with the question whether the affiant had rea-
sonable grounds at the time of his affidavit . . . for the belief that
the law was being violated on the premises to be searched; and if
the apparent facts set out in the affidavit are such that a reason-
ably discreet and prudent man would be led to believe that there
was a commission of the offense charged, there is probable cause
justifying the issuance of a warrant.” 111 Probable cause is to be de-

rant); Lo-Ji Sales v. New York, 442 U.S. 319 (1979) (justice of the peace issued open-
ended search warrant for obscene materials, accompanied police during its execu-
tion, and made probable cause determinations at the scene as to particular items).
     109 Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 270–71 (1960) (approving issuance of

warrants by United States Commissioners, many of whom were not lawyers and
none of whom had any guarantees of tenure and salary); Shadwick v. City of Tampa,
407 U.S. 345 (1972) (approving issuance of arrest warrants for violation of city ordi-
nances by city clerks who were assigned to and supervised by municipal court judges).
The Court reserved the question “whether a State may lodge warrant authority in
someone entirely outside the sphere of the judicial branch. Many persons may not
qualify as the kind of ‘public civil officers’ we have come to associate with the term
‘magistrate.’ Had the Tampa clerk been entirely divorced from a judicial position,
this case would have presented different considerations.” Id. at 352.
     110 407 U.S. at 350–54 (placing on defendant the burden of demonstrating that

the issuing official lacks capacity to determine probable cause). See also Connally v.
Georgia, 429 U.S. 245 (1977) (unsalaried justice of the peace who receives a sum of
money for each warrant issued but nothing for reviewing and denying a warrant is
not sufficiently detached).
     111 Dumbra v. United States, 268 U.S. 435, 439, 441 (1925). “[T]he term ‘prob-

able cause’ . . . means less than evidence which would justify condemnation.” Lock
v. United States, 11 U.S. (7 Cr.) 339, 348 (1813). See Steele v. United States, 267
U.S. 498, 504–05 (1925). It may rest upon evidence that is not legally competent in
a criminal trial, Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 311 (1959), and it need not
be sufficient to prove guilt in a criminal trial. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S.
160, 173 (1949). See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 107–08 (1965). An
“anticipatory” warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment as long as there is
probable cause to believe that the condition precedent to execution of the search
warrant will occur and that, once it has occurred, “there is a fair probability that
contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a specified place.” United States
v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 95 (2006), quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).
“An anticipatory warrant is ‘a warrant based upon an affidavit showing probable
cause that at some future time (but not presently) certain evidence of a crime will
be located at a specified place.’ ” 547 U.S. at 94.
