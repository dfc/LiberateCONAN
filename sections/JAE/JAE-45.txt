gently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm
or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was neces-
sary to detain the defendant.” 228
    Similar principles govern detention of luggage at airports in or-
der to detect the presence of drugs; Terry “limitations applicable to
investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible
scope of an investigative detention of the person’s luggage on less
than probable cause.” 229 The general rule is that “when an officer’s
observations lead him reasonably to believe that a traveler is carry-
ing luggage that contains narcotics, the principles of Terry . . . would
permit the officer to detain the luggage briefly to investigate the
circumstances that aroused his suspicion, provided that the investi-
gative detention is properly limited in scope.” 230 Seizure of luggage
for an expeditious “canine sniff ” by a dog trained to detect narcot-
ics can satisfy this test even though seizure of luggage is in effect
detention of the traveler, since the procedure results in “limited dis-
closure,” impinges only slightly on a traveler’s privacy interest in
the contents of personal luggage, and does not constitute a search
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.231 By contrast, tak-
ing a suspect to an interrogation room on grounds short of prob-
able cause, retaining his air ticket, and retrieving his luggage with-
out his permission taints consent given under such circumstances
to open the luggage, since by then the detention had exceeded the
bounds of a permissible Terry investigative stop and amounted to
an invalid arrest.232 But the same requirements for brevity of de-
tention and limited scope of investigation are apparently inappli-
cable to border searches of international travelers, the Court hav-
ing approved a 24-hour detention of a traveler suspected of smuggling
drugs in her alimentary canal.233

     228 United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985). A more relaxed standard

has been applied to detention of travelers at the border, the Court testing the rea-
sonableness in terms of “the period of time necessary to either verify or dispel the
suspicion.” United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 544 (1985) (ap-
proving warrantless detention for more than 24 hours of traveler suspected of ali-
mentary canal drug smuggling).
     229 United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 709 (1983).
     230 462 U.S. at 706.
     231 462 U.S. at 707. However, the search in Place was not expeditious, and hence

exceeded Fourth Amendment bounds, when agents took 90 minutes to transport lug-
gage to another airport for administration of the canine sniff. Cf. Illinois v. Caballes,
543 U.S. 405 (2005) (a canine sniff around the perimeter of a car following a routine
traffic stop does not offend the Fourth Amendment if the duration of the stop is
justified by the traffic offense).
     232 Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983). On this much the plurality opinion of

Justice White (id. at 503), joined by three other Justices, and the concurring opin-
ion of Justice Brennan (id. at 509) were in agreement.
     233 United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985).
