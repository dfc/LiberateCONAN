    Thus, protection of the home is at the apex of Fourth Amend-
ment coverage because of the right associated with ownership to
exclude others; 49 but ownership of other things, i.e., automobiles,
does not carry a similar high degree of protection.50 That a person
has taken normal precautions to maintain his privacy, that is, pre-
cautions customarily taken by those seeking to exclude others, is
usually a significant factor in determining legitimacy of expecta-
tion.51 Some expectations, the Court has held, are simply not among
those that society is prepared to accept.52 In the context of norms
for the use of rapidly evolving communications devices, the Court
was reluctant to consider “the whole concept of privacy expecta-
tions” at all, preferring other decisional grounds: “The judiciary risks
error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implica-
tions of emerging technology before its role in society has become
clear.” 53
    What seems to have emerged is a balancing standard that re-
quires “an assessing of the nature of a particular practice and the
likely extent of its impact on the individual’s sense of security bal-
anced against the utility of the conduct as a technique of law en-
forcement.” Whereas Justice Harlan saw a greater need to restrain
police officers through the warrant requirement as the intrusions
