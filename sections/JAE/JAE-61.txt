Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by public school
officials because “school officials act as representatives of the State,
not merely as surrogates for the parents.” 325 However, “the school
setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches
by public authorities are ordinarily subject.” 326 Neither the war-
rant requirement nor the probable cause standard is appropriate,
the Court ruled. Instead, a simple reasonableness standard gov-
erns all searches of students’ persons and effects by school authori-
ties.327 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must
be “reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up
evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law
or the rules of the school.” 328 School searches must also be reason-
ably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interfer-
ence, and “not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of
the student and the nature of the infraction.” 329 In applying these
rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student’s purse
to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule
by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for ciga-
rettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a pros-
ecution under the juvenile laws.
     In Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding,330 a student
found in possession of prescription ibuprofen pills at school stated
that the pills had come from another student, 13-year-old Savana
Redding. The Court found that the first student’s statement was
sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was in-
volved in pill distribution, and that this suspicion was enough to
justify a search of Savana’s backpack and outer clothing.331 School
officials, however, had also “directed Savana to remove her clothes
down to her underwear, and then ‘pull out’ her bra and the elastic
band on her underpants” 332—an action that the Court thought could
fairly be labeled a strip search. Taking into account that “adoles-
cent vulnerability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the expo-

late their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense.” 469 U.S.

ing to adopt a standard under which the legality of a search is dependent upon a
judge’s evaluation of the relative importance of various school rules.” Id. at n.9.

doing. Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. ___, No. 08–479, slip
