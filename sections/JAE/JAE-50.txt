search.” 255 In Arizona v. Gant,256 however, the Court disavowed this
understanding of Belton 257 and held that “[p]olice may search a ve-
hicle incident to a recent occupant’s arrest only if the arrestee is
within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time
of the search or it is reasonable to believe that the vehicle contains
evidence of the offense of arrest.” 258
     Vehicular Searches.—In the early days of the automobile, the
Court created an exception for searches of vehicles, holding in Car-
roll v. United States 259 that vehicles may be searched without war-
rants if the officer undertaking the search has probable cause to
believe that the vehicle contains contraband. The Court explained
that the mobility of vehicles would allow them to be quickly moved
from the jurisdiction if time were taken to obtain a warrant.260
    Initially, the Court limited Carroll’s reach, holding impermis-
sible the warrantless seizure of a parked automobile merely be-
cause it is movable, and indicating that vehicles may be stopped
only while moving or reasonably contemporaneously with move-
ment.261 The Court also ruled that the search must be reasonably
contemporaneous with the stop, so that it was not permissible to
remove the vehicle to the station house for a warrantless search at
the convenience of the police.262
    The Court next developed a reduced privacy rationale to supple-

and regulation of automobiles often may dilute the reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy that exists with respect to differently situated
property.” 263 “One has a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor
