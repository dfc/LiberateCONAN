to the states, Justice Frankfurter seemed to find the rule to be based
on the Court’s supervisory powers. Mapp establishes that the rule
is of constitutional origin, but this does not necessarily establish
that it is immune to statutory revision.
    Suggestions appear in a number of cases, including Weeks, to
the effect that admission of illegally seized evidence is itself uncon-
stitutional.443 These suggestions were often combined with a ratio-
nale emphasizing “judicial integrity” as a reason to reject the prof-
fer of such evidence.444 Yet the Court permitted such evidence to be
introduced into trial courts when the defendant lacked “standing”
to object to the search and seizure that produced the evidence 445
or when the search took place before the announcement of the deci-
sion extending the exclusionary rule to the states.446 At these times,
the Court turned to the “basic postulate of the exclusionary rule
itself. The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is
to deter—to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the
only effectively available way—by removing the incentive to disre-
gard it.” 447 “Mapp had as its prime purpose the enforcement of the
Fourth Amendment through the inclusion of the exclusionary rule
within its rights. This, it was found, was the only effective deter-
rent to lawless police action. Indeed, all of the cases since Wolf re-
quiring the exclusion of illegal evidence have been based on the ne-
cessity for an effective deterrent to illegal police action.” 448

senting), except where self-incrimination values were present. Mapp v. Ohio, 367
U.S. 643, 661 (1961) (concurring). See also id. at 678 (Justice Harlan dissenting);

      443 “The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to ob-

tain convictions by means of unlawful searches and enforced confessions . . . should
find no sanction in the judgment of the courts which are charged at all times with
the support of the Constitution . . . .” Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392
(1914). In Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655, 657 (1961), Justice Clark maintained
that “the Fourth Amendment include[s] the exclusion of the evidence seized in viola-
tion of its provisions” and that it, and the Fifth Amendment with regard to confes-
sions “assures . . . that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence.” In
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 12, 13 (1968), Chief Justice Warren wrote: “Courts which
sit under our Constitution cannot and will not be made party to lawless invasions
of the constitutional rights of citizens by permitting unhindered governmental use
of the fruits of such invasions. . . . A ruling admitting evidence in a criminal trial
. . . has the necessary effect of legitimizing the conduct which produced the evi-
dence.”
