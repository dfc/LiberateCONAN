dure.” 18 Exceptions to searches under warrants were to be closely
contained by the rationale undergirding the necessity for the excep-
tion, and the scope of a search under one of the exceptions was simi-
larly limited.19
    During the 1970s the Court was closely divided on which stan-
dard to apply.20 For a while, the balance tipped in favor of the view
that warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, with a few care-
fully prescribed exceptions.21 Gradually, guided by the variable-
expectation-of-privacy approach to coverage of the Fourth Amend-
ment, the Court broadened its view of permissible exceptions and
of the scope of those exceptions.22 By 1992, it was no longer the

     18 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968). In United States v. United States Dis-

trict Court, 407 U.S. 297, 321 (1972), Justice Powell explained that the “very heart”
of the Amendment’s mandate is “that where practical, a governmental search and
seizure should represent both the efforts of the officer to gather evidence of wrong-
ful acts and the judgment of the magistrate that the collected evidence is sufficient
to justify invasion of a citizen’s private premises or conversation.” Thus, what is “rea-
sonable” in terms of a search and seizure derives content and meaning through ref-
erence to the warrant clause. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 473–84 (1971).
See also Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 728 (1969); Katz v. United States, 389
U.S. 347, 356–58 (1967); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 299 (1967).
     19 Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762–64 (1969) (limiting scope of search

incident to arrest). See also United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S.
297 (1972) (rejecting argument that it was “reasonable” to allow President through
Attorney General to authorize warrantless electronic surveillance of persons thought
to be endangering the national security); Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)
(although officers acted with great self-restraint and reasonably in engaging in elec-
tronic seizures of conversations from a telephone booth, a magistrate’s antecedent
judgment was required); Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364 (1964) (warrantless
search of seized automobile not justified because not within rationale of exceptions
to warrant clause). There were exceptions, e.g., Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58
(1967) (warrantless search of impounded car was reasonable); United States v. Har-
ris, 390 U.S. 234 (1968) (warrantless inventory search of automobile).
     20 See, e.g., Almighty-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266 (1973), Justices

Stewart, Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall adhered to the warrant-based rule, while
Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist, and Chief Justice Burger placed greater
emphasis upon the question of reasonableness without necessary regard to the war-
rant requirement. Id. at 285. Justice Powell generally agreed with the former group
of Justices, id. at 275 (concurring).
     21 E.g., G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352–53 (1977) (unani-

mous); Marshall v. Barrow’s, Inc., 436 U.S. 307, 312 (1978); Michigan v. Tyler, 436
U.S. 499, 506 (1978); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 390 (1978) (unanimous); Ar-
kansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 743 (1979) (1979); United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798,
824–25 (1982).
     22 E.g., Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42 (1970) (warrantless search of automo-

bile taken to police station); Texas v. White, 423 U.S. 67 (1975) (same); New York v.
Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981) (search of vehicle incident to arrest); United States v.
Ross, 456 U.S. 798 (1982) (automobile search at scene); Brigham City, Utah v. Stu-
art, 547 U.S. 398 (2006) (warrantless entry into a home when police have an objec-
tively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or immi-
nently threatened with such injury); Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U.S. ___, No. 09–91
(2009) (applying Brigham City). On the other hand, the warrant-based standard did
preclude a number of warrantless searches. E.g., Almighty-Sanchez v. United States,
