or other third parties into a home during execution of a warrant if
presence of those persons was not in aid of execution of the war-
rant.184
    In executing a warrant for a search of premises and named per-
sons on it, police officers may not automatically search an un-
named person found there.185 If they can articulate some reason-
able basis for fearing for their safety they may conduct a “patdown”,
but to search they must have probable cause particularized with
respect to the unnamed person. Detaining occupants of a premises
pending completion of a search is another matter. In Michigan v.
Summers,186 the Court held that officers executing a search war-
rant could detain an occupant found on site without having to show
probable cause. The Court determined that detention incident to a
search, which it considered “substantially less intrusive” than ar-
rest, was justified because detention could minimize the risk of harm
to officers, facilitate entry and the conduct of the search, and pre-
vent flight.187 The occupant in Summers was descending his front
steps when the police arrived with the search warrant. The law en-
forcement interests underlying detention incident to search clearly
pertained,and the detention was upheld. But what if law enforce-
ment officers allow an exiting occupant to proceed some distance
before stopping and detaining him?
     184 Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603 (1999). Accord, Hanlon v. Berger, 526 U.S.

808 (1999) (media camera crew “ride-along” with Fish and Wildlife Service agents
executing a warrant to search respondent’s ranch for evidence of illegal taking of
wildlife).
     185 Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979) (patron in a bar), relying on and reaf-

firming United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581 (1948) (occupant of vehicle may not be
searched merely because there are grounds to search the automobile). But see Mary-
land v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366 (2003) (distinguishing Ybarra on basis that passengers
in car often have “common enterprise,” and noting that the tip in Di Re implicated
only the driver.
     186 452 U.S. 692 (1981).
     187 452 U.S. at 701–06. Ybarra was distinguished on the basis of its greater in-

trusiveness and the lack of sufficient connection with the premises. Id. at 695 n.4.
By the time Summers was searched, police had probable cause to do so. Id. at 695.
The warrant here was for contraband, id. at 701, and a different rule may apply
with respect to warrants for other evidence, id. at 705 n.20. In Los Angeles County
v. Rettele, 550 U.S. 609 (2007), the Court found no Fourth Amendment violation
where deputies did not know that the suspects had sold the house that the deputies
had a warrant to search. The deputies entered the house and found the new own-
ers, of a different race from the suspects, sleeping in the nude. The deputies held
the new owners at gunpoint for one to two minutes without allowing them to dress
or cover themselves. As for the difference in race, the Court noted that, “[w]hen the
deputies ordered [Caucasian] respondents from their bed, they had no way of know-
ing whether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house.” Id. at 613.
As for not allowing the new owners to dress or cover themselves, the Court quoted
its statement in Michigan v. Summers that “[t]he risk of harm to both the police
and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned com-
mand of the situation.” Id. at 1993 (quoting 452 U.S. at 702–03).
