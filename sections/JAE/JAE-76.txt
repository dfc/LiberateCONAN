tremely rare.405 A police officer who makes an illegal search and
seizure is subject to internal departmental discipline, which may
be backed up by the oversight of police review boards in the few
jurisdictions that have adopted them, but, again, the examples of
disciplinary actions are exceedingly rare.406
    Civil remedies are also available. Persons who have been ille-
gally arrested or who have had their privacy invaded will usually
have a tort action available under state statutory or common law,
or against the Federal Government under the Federal Tort Claims
Act.407 Moreover, police officers acting under color of state law who
violate a person’s Fourth Amendment rights are subject to a suit in
federal court for damages and other remedies 408 under a civil rights
statute.409 Although federal officers and others acting under color
of federal law are not subject to this statute, the Supreme Court
has held that a right to damages for a violation of Fourth Amend-
ment rights arises by implication and that this right is enforceable
in federal courts.410
     Although a damages remedy might be made more effectual,411
legal and practical problems stand in the way.412 Law enforcement
officers have available to them the usual common-law defenses, the

     407 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671–2680. Section 2680(h) prohibits suits against the

Federal Government for false arrest and specified other intentional torts, but con-
tains an exception “with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforce-
ment officials of the United States Government.”
     408 If there are continuing and recurrent violations, federal injunctive relief would

be available. Cf. Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F.2d 197 (4th Cir. 1966); Wheeler v. Good-
man, 298 F. Supp. 935 (preliminary injunction), 306 F. Supp. 58 (permanent injunc-
tion) (W.D.N.C. 1969), vacated on jurisdictional grounds, 401 U.S. 987 (1971).
     409 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1964). See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961). In some

circumstances, the officer’s liability may be attributed to the municipality. Monell v.
New York City Dep’t of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). These claims that offi-
cers have used excessive force in the course of an arrest or investigatory stop are to
be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not under substantive due process. The
test is “whether the officers’ actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ under the facts and
circumstances confronting them.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989) (cited
with approval in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 381 (2007), in which a police officer’s
ramming a fleeing motorist’s car from behind in an attempt to stop him was found
reasonable).

had been hinted at in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946).

cotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 411, 422–24 (1971), which suggests a statute allowing
suit against the government in a special tribunal and a statutory remedy in lieu of
the exclusionary rule.
