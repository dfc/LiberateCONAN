dence from state criminal trials.383 State efforts to legalize wiretap-
ping pursuant to court orders were held by the Court to be precluded
by the fact that Congress in § 605 had intended to occupy the field
completely to the exclusion of the states.384
    Nontelephonic Electronic Surveillance.—The trespass ratio-
nale of Olmstead was used in cases dealing with “bugging” of prem-
ises rather than with tapping of telephones. Thus, in Goldman v.
United States,385 the Court found no Fourth Amendment violation
when a listening device was placed against a party wall so that con-
versations were overheard on the other side. But when officers drove
a “spike mike” into a party wall until it came into contact with a
heating duct and thus broadcast defendant’s conversations, the Court
determined that the trespass brought the case within the Amend-
ment.386 In so holding, the Court, without alluding to the matter,
overruled in effect the second rationale of Olmstead, the premise
that conversations could not be seized.
     The Berger and Katz Cases.—In Berger v. New York,387 the
Court confirmed the obsolescence of the alternative holding in Olmstead
that conversations could not be seized in the Fourth Amendment
sense.388 Berger held unconstitutional on its face a state eavesdrop-
ping statute under which judges were authorized to issue warrants
permitting police officers to trespass on private premises to install
listening devices. The warrants were to be issued upon a showing
of “reasonable ground to believe that evidence of crime may be thus
obtained, and particularly describing the person or persons whose
communications, conversations or discussions are to be overheard
or recorded.” For the five-Justice majority, Justice Clark discerned
several constitutional defects in the law. “First, . . . eavesdropping
is authorized without requiring belief that any particular offense
has been or is being committed; nor that the ‘property’ sought, the
conversations, be particularly described.”

violation of the Fourth Amendment could be admitted in state courts. Wolf v. Colo-

subject to the Fourth Amendment that Schwartz was overruled in Lee v. Florida,
