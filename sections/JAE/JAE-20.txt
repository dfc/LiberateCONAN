dards of inspections. Further, warrantless inspections were not nec-
essary to serve an important governmental interest, as most busi-
nesses would consent to inspection and it was not inconvenient to
require OSHA to resort to an administrative warrant in order to
inspect sites where consent was refused.87
     In Donovan v. Dewey,88 however, Barlow’s was substantially lim-
ited and a new standard emerged permitting extensive governmen-
tal inspection of commercial property,89 absent warrants. Under the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, governing underground and
surface mines (including stone quarries), federal officers are di-
rected to inspect underground mines at least four times a year and
surface mines at least twice a year, pursuant to extensive regula-
tions as to standards of safety. The statute specifically provides for
absence of advanced notice and requires the Secretary of Labor to
institute court actions for injunctive and other relief in cases in which
inspectors are denied admission. Sustaining the statute, the Court
proclaimed that government had a “greater latitude” to conduct war-
rantless inspections of commercial property than of homes, because
of “the fact that the expectation of privacy that the owner of com-
mercial property enjoys in such property differs significantly from
the sanctity accorded an individual’s home, and that this privacy
interest may, in certain circumstances, be adequately protected by
regulatory schemes authorizing warrantless inspections.” 90

     87 Administrative warrants issued on the basis of less than probable cause but

only on a showing that a specific business had been chosen for inspection on the
basis of a general administrative plan would suffice. Even without a necessity for
probable cause, the requirement would assure the interposition of a neutral officer
to establish that the inspection was reasonable and was properly authorized. 436
U.S. at 321, 323. The dissenters objected that the warrant clause was being consti-
tutionally diluted. Id. at 325. Administrative warrants were approved also in Camara
v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 538 (1967). Previously, one of the reasons given
for finding administrative and noncriminal inspections not covered by the Fourth
Amendment was the fact that the warrant clause would be as rigorously applied to
them as to criminal searches and seizures. Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360, 373
(1959). See also Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 275 (1973) (Justice
Powell concurring) (suggesting a similar administrative warrant procedure empow-
ering police and immigration officers to conduct roving searches of automobiles in
areas near the Nation’s borders); id. at 270 n.3 (indicating that majority Justices
were divided on the validity of such area search warrants); id. at 288 (dissenting
Justice White indicating approval); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543,
547 n.2, 562 n.15 (1976).
     88 452 U.S. 594 (1981).
     89 There is no suggestion that warrantless inspections of homes is broadened.

452 U.S. at 598, or that warrantless entry under exigent circumstances is curtailed.
See, e.g., Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499 (1978) (no warrant required for entry by
firefighters to fight fire; once there, firefighters may remain for reasonable time to
investigate the cause of the fire).
     90 Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 594, 598–99 (1981).
