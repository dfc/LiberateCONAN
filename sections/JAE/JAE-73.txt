to successful electronic surveillance, was summarily disposed of.394
Finally, Justice Stewart observed that it was unlikely that elec-
tronic surveillance would ever come under any of the established
exceptions so that it could be conducted without prior judicial ap-
proval.395
    Following Katz, Congress enacted in 1968 a comprehensive stat-
ute authorizing federal officers and permitting state officers pursu-
ant to state legislation complying with the federal law to seek war-
rants for electronic surveillance to investigate violations of prescribed
classes of criminal legislation.396 The Court has not yet had occa-
sion to pass on the federal statute and to determine whether its
procedures and authorizations comport with the standards sketched
in Osborn, Berger, and Katz or whether those standards are some-
what more flexible than they appear to be on the faces of the opin-
ions.397




      394 “A conventional warrant ordinarily serves to notify the suspect of an in-

tended search . . . . In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court
. . . simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their pur-
pose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would
provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence.” 389 U.S.
at 355 n.16.
      395 389 U.S. at 357–58. Justice Black dissented, feeling that the Fourth Amend-

ment applied only to searches for and seizures of tangible things and not conversa-
tions. Id. at 364. Two “beeper” decisions support the general applicability of the war-
rant requirement if electronic surveillance will impair legitimate privacy interests.
Compare United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983) (no Fourth Amendment viola-
tion in relying on a beeper, installed without warrant, to aid in monitoring progress
of a car on the public roads, since there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in
destination of travel on the public roads), with United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705
(1984) (beeper installed without a warrant may not be used to obtain information
as to the continuing presence of an item within a private residence).
      396 Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat.

211, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510–20.
      397 The Court has interpreted the statute several times without reaching the

constitutional questions. United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143 (1974); United States
v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505 (1974); United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562 (1974); United
States v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413 (1977); Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978);
Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238 (1979); United States v. New York Telephone
Co., 434 U.S. 159 (1977); United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741 (1979). Dalia su-
pra, did pass on one constitutional issue, whether the Fourth Amendment man-
dated specific warrant authorization for a surreptitious entry to install an autho-
rized “bug.” See also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979) (no reasonable expectation
of privacy in numbers dialed on one’s telephone, so Fourth Amendment does not
require a warrant to install “pen register” to record those numbers).
