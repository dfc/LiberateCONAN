consents to a search of shared premises, but a physically present
co-occupant expressly objects to the search, the search is unreason-
able.302
     Border Searches.—“That searches made at the border, pursu-
ant to the longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by
stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this coun-
try, are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at
the border, should, by now, require no extended demonstration.” 303
Authorized by the First Congress,304 the customs search in these
circumstances requires no warrant, no probable cause, not even the
showing of some degree of suspicion that accompanies even investi-
gatory stops.305 Moreover, although prolonged detention of travel-
ers beyond the routine customs search and inspection must be jus-
tified by the Terry standard of reasonable suspicion having a
particularized and objective basis, Terry protections as to the length
and intrusiveness of the search do not apply.306 Motor vehicles may
be searched at the border, even to the extent of removing, disassem-
bling, and reassembling the fuel tank.307
    Inland stoppings and searches in areas away from the borders
are a different matter altogether. Thus, in Almeida-Sanchez v. United

     302 Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006) (warrantless search of a defen-

dant’s residence based on his estranged wife’s consent was unreasonable and in-
valid as applied to a physically present defendant who expressly refused to permit
entry). The Court in Randolph admitted that it was “drawing a fine line,” id. at
121, between situations where the defendant is present and expressly refuses con-
sent, and that of United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 171 (1974), and Illinois v.
Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177 (1990), where the defendants were nearby but were not
asked for their permission. In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Roberts observed
that the majority’s ruling “provides protection on a random and happenstance basis,
protecting, for example, a co-occupant who happens to be at the front door when the
other occupant consents to a search, but not one napping or watching television in
the next room.” 547 U.S. at 127.
     303 United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 616 (1977) (sustaining search of in-

coming mail). See also Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U.S. 765 (1983) (opening by customs
inspector of locked container shipped from abroad).

     305 Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 154 (1925); United States v. Thirty-

seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 376 (1971); Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413
U.S. 266, 272 (1973).
     306 United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985) (approving war-

rantless detention incommunicado for more than 24 hours of traveler suspected of
alimentary canal drug smuggling). The traveler was strip searched, and then given
a choice between an abdominal x-ray or monitored bowel movements. Because the
suspect chose the latter option, the court disavowed decision as to “what level of
suspicion, if any, is required for . . . strip, body cavity, or involuntary x-ray searches.”
