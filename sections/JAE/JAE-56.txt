form a person of his rights, as through a Fourth Amendment ver-
sion of Miranda warnings.297 But consent will not be regarded as
voluntary when the officer asserts his official status and claim of
right and the occupant yields because of these factors.298 When con-
sent is obtained through the deception of an undercover officer or
an informer’s gaining admission without advising a suspect who he
is, the Court has held that the suspect has simply assumed the risk
that an invitee would betray him, and evidence obtained through
the deception is admissible.299
    Additional issues arise in determining the validity of consent
to search when consent is given not by the suspect, but by a third
party. In the earlier cases, third-party consent was deemed suffi-
cient if that party “possessed common authority over or other suffi-
cient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be in-
spected.” 300 Now, however, actual common authority over the premises
is not required; it is sufficient if the searching officer had a reason-
