a prisoner has escaped and taken refuge in his dwelling, and those
in which officers have reason to believe that destruction of evi-
dence is likely. The test, articulated two years later in Richards v.
Wisconsin,178 is whether police have “a reasonable suspicion that
knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular cir-
cumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit
the effective investigation of the crime.” In Richards, the Court held
that there is no blanket exception to the rule whenever officers are
executing a search warrant in a felony drug investigation; instead,
a case-by-case analysis is required to determine whether no-knock
entry is justified under the circumstances.179 Similarly, if officers
choose to knock and announce before searching for drugs, circum-
stances may justify forced entry if there is not a prompt re-
sponse.180 Recent federal laws providing for the issuance of war-
rants authorizing in certain circumstances “no-knock” entries to execute
warrants will no doubt present the Court with opportunities to ex-
plore the configurations of the rule of announcement.181 A statute
regulating the expiration of a warrant and issuance of another “should
be liberally construed in favor of the individual.” 182 Similarly, just
as the existence of probable cause must be established by fresh facts,
so the execution of the warrant should be done in timely fashion so
as to ensure so far as possible the continued existence of probable
cause.183
     Because police actions in execution of a warrant must be re-
lated to the objectives of the authorized intrusion, and because pri-
vacy of the home lies at the core of the Fourth Amendment, police
officers violate the Amendment by bringing members of the media

    179  The fact that officers may have to destroy property in order to conduct a
no-knock entry has no bearing on the reasonableness of their decision not to knock
and announce. United States v. Ramirez, 523 U.S. 65 (1998).
     180 United States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31 (2003) (forced entry was permissible af-

ter officers executing a warrant to search for drugs knocked, announced “police search
warrant,” and waited 15–20 seconds with no response).
     181 In narcotics cases, magistrates are authorized to issue “no-knock” warrants

if they find there is probable cause to believe (1) the property sought may, and if
notice is given, will be easily and quickly destroyed or (2) giving notice will endan-
ger the life or safety of the executing officer or another person. 21 U.S.C. § 879(b).
