leave.” 217 A majority of the Justices subsequently endorsed this rea-
sonable perception standard 218 and applied it in several cases in
which admissibility of evidence turned on whether a seizure of the
person not justified by probable cause or reasonable suspicion had
occurred prior to the uncovering of the evidence. No seizure oc-
curred, for example, when INS agents seeking to identify illegal aliens
conducted workforce surveys within a garment factory; while some
agents were positioned at exits, others systematically moved through
the factory and questioned employees.219 This brief questioning, even
with blocked exits, amounted to “classic consensual encounters rather
than Fourth Amendment seizures.” 220 The Court also ruled that no
seizure had occurred when police in a squad car drove alongside a
suspect who had turned and run down the sidewalk when he saw
the squad car approach. Under the circumstances (no siren, flash-
ing lights, display of a weapon, or blocking of the suspect’s path),
the Court concluded, the police conduct “would not have communi-
cated to the reasonable person an attempt to capture or otherwise
intrude upon [one’s] freedom of movement.” 221
     Soon after, however, the Court departed from the Mendenhall
reasonable-perception standard and adopted a more formalistic ap-
proach, holding that an actual chase with evident intent to capture
did not amount to a “seizure” because the suspect had not com-
plied with the officer’s order to halt. The Court in California v. Hodari
D. wrote that Mendenhall stated a “necessary” but not a “suffi-
cient” condition for a seizure of the person through show of author-
ity.222 A Fourth Amendment “seizure” of the person, the Court de-
termined, is the same as a common law arrest; there must be either
application of physical force (or the laying on of hands), or submis-
sion to the assertion of authority.223 Indications are, however, that
Hodari D. did not signal the end of the reasonable perception stan-
dard, but merely carved an exception applicable to chases and per-
haps other encounters between suspects and police.

    217  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980).
    218  See, e.g., Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983), in which there was no opin-
ion of the Court, but in which the test was used by the plurality of four, id. at 502,
and also endorsed by dissenting Justice Blackmun, id. at 514.
     219 INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210 (1984).
     220 466 U.S. at 221.
     221 Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 575 (1988).
     222 499 U.S. 621, 628 (1991). As in Michigan v. Chesternut, supra, the suspect

dropped incriminating evidence while being chased.
     223 Adherence to this approach would effectively nullify the Court’s earlier posi-

tion that Fourth Amendment protections extend to “seizures that involve only a brief
detention short of traditional arrest.” United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873,
878 (1975), quoted in INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 215 (1984).
