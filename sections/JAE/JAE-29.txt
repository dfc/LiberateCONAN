warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is
left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.” 127 This
requirement thus acts to limit the scope of the search, as the execut-
ing officers should be limited to looking in places where the de-
scribed object could be expected to be found.128 The purpose of the
particularity requirement extends beyond prevention of general
searches; it also assures the person whose property is being searched
of the lawful authority of the executing officer and of the limits of
his power to search. It follows, therefore, that the warrant itself
must describe with particularity the items to be seized, or that such
itemization must appear in documents incorporated by reference in
the warrant and actually shown to the person whose property is to
be searched.129
    First Amendment Bearing on Probable Cause and Particu-
larity.—Where the warrant process is used to authorize seizure of
books and other items that may be protected by the First Amend-
ment, the Court has required government to observe more exacting
standards than in other cases.130 Seizure of materials arguably pro-
tected by the First Amendment is a form of prior restraint that re-
quires strict observance of the Fourth Amendment. At a minimum,

     127 Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192, 196 (1927). See Stanford v. Texas,

379 U.S. 476 (1965). Of course, police who are lawfully on the premises pursuant to
a warrant may seize evidence of crime in “plain view” even if that evidence is not
described in the warrant. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 464–71 (1971).
     128 In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 17–19, (1968), the Court wrote: “This Court has

held in the past that a search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the
Fourth Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope. Kremen v. United
States, 353 U.S. 346 (1957); Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344,
356–58 (1931); see United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 586–87 (1948). The scope
of the search must be ‘strictly tied to and justified by’ the circumstances which ren-
dered its initiation permissible. Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 310 (1967) (Jus-
tice Fortas concurring); see, e.g., Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367–368
(1964); Agnello v. United States, 296 U.S. 20, 30–31 (1925).” See also Andresen v.
Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 470–82 (1976), and id. at 484, 492–93 (Justice Brennan
dissenting). In Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 569 (1969), Justices Stewart, Bren-
nan, and White would have based the decision on the principle that a valid warrant
for gambling paraphernalia did not authorize police upon discovering motion pic-
ture films in the course of the search to project the films to learn their contents.
     129 Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551 (2004) (a search based on a warrant that did

not describe the items to be seized was “plainly invalid”; particularity contained in
supporting documents not cross-referenced by the warrant and not accompanying
the warrant is insufficient); United States v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 97, 99 (2006) (be-
cause the language of the Fourth Amendment “specifies only two matters that must
be ‘particularly describ[ed]’ in the warrant: ‘the place to be searched’ and ‘the per-
sons or things to be seized[,]’ . . . the Fourth Amendment does not require that the
triggering condition for an anticipatory warrant be set forth in the warrant itself.”
     130 Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717, 730–31 (1961); Stanford v. Texas,

379 U.S. 476, 485 (1965). For First Amendment implications of seizures under the
Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), see First Amend-
ment: Obscenity and Prior Restraint.
