search of the car 276 unless they exercise their discretion to arrest
the driver instead of issuing a citation.277 And once police have prob-
able cause to believe there is contraband in a vehicle, they may re-
move the vehicle from the scene to the station house in order to
conduct a search, without thereby being required to obtain a war-
rant.278 “[T]he justification to conduct such a warrantless search does
not vanish once the car has been immobilized; nor does it depend
upon a reviewing court’s assessment of the likelihood in each par-
ticular case that the car would have been driven away, or that its
contents would have been tampered with, during the period re-
quired for the police to obtain a warrant.” 279 Because of the less-
ened expectation of privacy, inventory searches of impounded auto-
mobiles are justifiable in order to protect public safety and the owner’s
property, and any evidence of criminal activity discovered in the course
of the inventories is admissible in court.280 The Justices were evenly
divided, however, on the propriety of warrantless seizure of an ar-
restee’s automobile from a public parking lot several hours after his
arrest, its transportation to a police impoundment lot, and the tak-
ing of tire casts and exterior paint scrapings.281



     276 Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 113 (1998) (invalidating an Iowa statute permit-

ting a full-blown search incident to a traffic citation).
     277 See Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318 (2001) (police officers, in their

discretion, may arrest a motorist for a minor traffic offense rather than issuing a
citation); New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981) (officers who arrest an occupant
of a vehicle may make a contemporaneous search of the entire passenger compart-
ment, including closed containers); Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615 (2004)
(the Belton rule applies regardless of whether the arrestee exited the car at the offi-
cer’s direction, or whether he did so prior to confrontation); Arizona v. Gant, 556
U.S. ___, No. 07–542, slip op. at 18 (2009) (the Belton rule applies “only if the ar-
restee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the
search or it is reasonable to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense
of arrest”); Arkansas v. Sullivan, 532 U.S. 769 (2001) (pretextual arrest of motorist
who has committed a traffic offense is permissible even if purpose is to search ve-
hicle for evidence of other crime).
     278 Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259 (1982). The same rule applies if it is the

vehicle itself that is forfeitable contraband; police, acting without a warrant, may
seize the vehicle from a public place. Florida v. White, 526 U.S. 559 (1999).
