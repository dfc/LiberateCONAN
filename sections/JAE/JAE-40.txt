sufficing to establish probable cause retroactively.200 There are, how-
ever, instances when a police officer’s suspicions will have been aroused
by someone’s conduct or manner, but probable cause for placing such
a person under arrest will be lacking.201 In Terry v. Ohio,202 the
Court, with only Justice Douglas dissenting, approved an on-the-
street investigation by a police officer that involved “patting down”
the subject of the investigation for weapons.
     Terry arose when a police officer observed three individuals en-
gaging in conduct which appeared to him, on the basis of training
and experience, to be the “casing” of a store for a likely armed rob-
bery. Upon approaching the men, identifying himself, and not re-
ceiving prompt identification, the officer seized one of the men, pat-
ted the exterior of his clothes, and discovered a gun. Chief Justice
Warren for the Court wrote that the Fourth Amendment was appli-
cable “whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains
his freedom to walk away.” 203 Because the warrant clause is neces-
sarily and practically of no application to the type of on-the-street
encounter present in Terry, the Chief Justice continued, the ques-
tion was whether the policeman’s actions were reasonable. The test
of reasonableness in this sort of situation is whether the police offi-
cer can point to “specific and articulable facts which, taken to-
gether with rational inferences from those facts,” would lead a neu-
tral magistrate on review to conclude that a man of reasonable caution
would be warranted in believing that possible criminal behavior was
at hand and that both an investigative stop and a “frisk” was re-
quired.204 Because the conduct witnessed by the police officer rea-
sonably led him to believe that an armed robbery was in prospect,
he was as reasonably led to believe that the men were armed and
probably dangerous and that his safety required a “frisk.” Because
the object of the “frisk” is the discovery of dangerous weapons, “it
must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably de-
signed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments
for the assault of the police officer.” 205
