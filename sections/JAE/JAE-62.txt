sure” and that, according to a study, a strip search can “result in
serious emotional damage,” the Court found that the search vio-
lated the Fourth Amendment.333 “Because there were no reasons to
suspect the drugs presented a danger or were concealed in her un-
derwear,” the Court wrote, “the content of the suspicion failed to
match the degree of intrusion.” 334 But, even though the Court found
that the search had violated the Fourth Amendment, it found that
the school officials who conducted the search were protected from
liability through qualified immunity, because the law prior to Red-
ding was not clearly established.335
     Government Workplace.—Similar principles apply to a public
employer’s work-related search of its employees’ offices, desks, or
file cabinets, except that in this context the Court distinguished
searches conducted for law enforcement purposes. In O’Connor v.
Ortega,336 a majority of Justices agreed, albeit on somewhat differ-
ing rationales, that neither a warrant nor a probable cause require-
ment should apply to employer searches “for noninvestigatory, work-
related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related
misconduct.” 337 Four Justices would require a case-by-case inquiry
into the reasonableness of such searches; 338 one would hold that
such searches “do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” 339
     In City of Ontario v. Quon,340 the Court bypassed adopting an
approach for determining a government employee’s reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy, an issue unresolved in O’Connor. Rather, the
Quon Court followed the “special needs” holding in O’Connor and
found that, even assuming a reasonable expectation of privacy, a
city’s warrantless search of the transcripts of a police officer’s on-
duty text messages on city equipment was reasonable because it
was justified at its inception by noninvestigatory work-related pur-
poses and was not excessively intrusive.341 A jury had found the
purpose of the search to be to determine whether the city’s con-
tract with its wireless service provider was adequate, and the Court

    334  557 U.S. ___, No. 08–479, slip op. at 1, 9. Justice Thomas dissented from the
finding of a Fourth Amendment violation.

dissented from the grant of qualified immunity.

     337 480 U.S. at 725. Not at issue was whether there must be individualized sus-

picion for investigations of work-related misconduct.
     338 This position was stated in Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion, joined by

Chief Justice Rehnquist and by Justices White and Powell.

     341 In Quon, a police officer was dismissed after a review of the transcripts of

his on-duty text messages revealed that a large majority of his texting was not re-
lated to work, and some messages were sexually explicit.
