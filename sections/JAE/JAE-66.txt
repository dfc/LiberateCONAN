an accident investigation; in addition, the test may promote deter-

     In Von Raab the governmental interests underlying the Cus-
toms Service’s screening program were also termed “compelling”: to
ensure that persons entrusted with a firearm and the possible use
of deadly force not suffer from drug-induced impairment of percep-
tion and judgment, and that “front-line [drug] interdiction person-
nel [be] physically fit, and have unimpeachable integrity and judg-
ment.” 361 The possibly “substantial” interference with privacy interests
of these Customs employees was justified, the Court concluded, be-
cause, “[u]nlike most private citizens or government employees gen-
erally, they have a diminished expectation of privacy.” 362
     Emphasizing the “special needs” of the public school context, re-
flected in the “custodial and tutelary” power that schools exercise
over students, and also noting schoolchildren’s diminished expecta-
tion of privacy, the Court in Vernonia School District v. Acton 363
upheld a school district’s policy authorizing random urinalysis drug
testing of students who participate in interscholastic athletics. The
Court redefined the term “compelling” governmental interest. The
phrase does not describe a “fixed, minimum quantum of governmen-
tal concern,” the Court explained, but rather “describes an interest
which appears important enough to justify the particular search at
hand.” 364 Applying this standard, the Court concluded that “deter-
ring drug use by our Nation’s schoolchildren is at least as impor-
tant as enhancing efficient enforcement of the Nation’s laws against
the importation of drugs . . . or deterring drug use by engineers
and trainmen.” 365 On the other hand, the interference with privacy
interests was not great, the Court decided, since schoolchildren are
routinely required to submit to various physical examinations and
vaccinations. Moreover, “[l]egitimate privacy expectations are even
less [for] student athletes, since they normally suit up, shower, and
dress in locker rooms that afford no privacy, and since they volun-
tarily subject themselves to physical exams and other regulations
above and beyond those imposed on non-athletes.” 366 The Court “cau-
tion[ed] against the assumption that suspicionless drug testing will
readily pass muster in other contexts,” identifying as “the most sig-

justifications” relied upon by the Court, believing instead that the “only plausible
explanation” for the drug testing program was the “symbolism” of a government agency
