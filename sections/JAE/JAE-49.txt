pect, conduct an inventory search of the individual’s personal effects,
including the contents of a shoulder bag, since “the scope of a station-
house search may in some circumstances be even greater than those
supporting a search immediately following arrest.” 251
    Chimel has, however, been qualified by another consideration.
Not only may officers search areas within the arrestee’s immediate
control in order to alleviate any threat posed by the arrestee, but
they may extend that search if there may be a threat posed by “un-
seen third parties in the house.” A “protective sweep” of the entire
premises (including an arrestee’s home) may be undertaken on less
than probable cause if officers have a “reasonable belief,” based on
“articulable facts,” that the area to be swept may harbor an indi-
vidual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.252
    Stating that it was “in no way alter[ing] the fundamental prin-
ciples established in the Chimel case,” the Court in New York v.
Belton 253 held that police officers who had made a valid arrest of
the occupant of a vehicle could make a contemporaneous search of
the entire passenger compartment of the automobile, including con-
tainers found therein. Believing that a fairly simple rule understand-
able to authorities in the field was desirable, the Court ruled “that
articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger com-
partment of an automobile are in fact generally, if not inevitably,
within ‘the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab
a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].’ ” 254
    Belton was “widely understood to allow a vehicle search inci-
dent to the arrest of a recent occupant even if there is no possibil-
ity the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the

     251 Illinois v. LaFayette, 462 U.S. 640, 645 (1983) (inventory search) (following

South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976)). Similarly, an inventory search of
an impounded vehicle may include the contents of a closed container. Colorado v.
Bertine, 479 U.S. 367 (1987). Inventory searches of closed containers must, how-
ever, be guided by a police policy containing standardized criteria for exercise of dis-
cretion. Florida v. Wells, 495 U.S. 1 (1990).
     252 Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 334 (1990). This “sweep” is not to be a full-

blown, “top-to-bottom” search, but only “a cursory inspection of those spaces where
a person may be found.” Id. at 335–36.
     253 453 U.S. 454, 460 n.3 (1981).
     254 453 U.S. at 460 (quoting Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969)). In

this particular instance, Belton had been removed from the automobile and hand-
cuffed, but the Court wished to create a general rule removed from the fact-specific
nature of any one case. “ ‘Container’ here denotes any object capable of holding an-
other object. It thus includes closed or open glove compartments, consoles, or other
receptacles located anywhere within the passenger compartment, as well as lug-
gage, boxes, bags, clothing, and the like. Our holding encompasses only the interior
of the passenger compartment of an automobile and does not encompass the trunk.”
453 U.S. at 460–61 n.4.
