that involve only a brief detention short of arrest, although the na-
ture of the detention will determine whether probable cause or some
reasonable and articulable suspicion is necessary.71
    The Fourth Amendment does not require an officer to consider
whether to issue a citation rather than arresting (and placing in
custody) a person who has committed a minor offense—even a mi-
nor traffic offense. In Atwater v. City of Lago Vista,72 the Court, even
while acknowledging that the case before it involved “gratuitous hu-
miliations imposed by a police officer who was (at best) exercising
extremely poor judgment,” refused to require that “case-by-case de-
terminations of government need” to place traffic offenders in cus-
tody be subjected to a reasonableness inquiry, “lest every discretion-
ary judgment in the field be converted into an occasion for
constitutional review.” 73 Citing some state statutes that limit war-
rantless arrests for minor offenses, the Court contended that the
matter is better left to statutory rule than to application of broad
constitutional principle.74 Thus, Atwater and County of Riverside v.
McLaughlin 75 together mean that—as far as the Constitution is con-
cerned—police officers have almost unbridled discretion to decide
whether to issue a summons for a minor traffic offense or whether
instead to place the offending motorist in jail, where she may be
kept for up to 48 hours with little recourse. Even when an arrest
for a minor offense is prohibited by state law, the arrest will not
violate the Fourth Amendment if it was based on probable cause.76

stop an automobile . . . for the purpose of checking the driving license of the opera-
tor and the registration of the car, where there is neither probable cause to believe
nor reasonable suspicion” that a law was violated); Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51
(1979) (detaining a person for the purpose of requiring him to identify himself con-
stitutes a seizure requiring a “reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime had
just been, was being, or was about to be committed”); Reid v. Georgia, 448 U.S. 438,
441 (1980) (requesting ticket stubs and identification from persons disembarking from
plane not reasonable where stated justifications would apply to “a very large cat-
egory of innocent travelers,” e.g., travelers arrived from “a principal place of origin
of cocaine”); Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 705 (1981) (“it is constitutionally
reasonable to require that [a] citizen . . . remain while officers of the law execute a
valid warrant to search his home”); Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001) (approv-
ing “securing” of premises, preventing homeowner from reentering, while a search
warrant is obtained); Los Angeles County v. Rettele, 550 U.S. 609 (2007) (where depu-
ties executing a search warrant did not know that the house being searched had
recently been sold, it was reasonable to hold new homeowners, who had been sleep-
ing in the nude, at gunpoint for one to two minutes without allowing them to dress
or cover themselves, even though the deputies knew that the homeowners were of a
different race from the suspects named in the warrant).
