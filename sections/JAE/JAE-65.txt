    “[O]n the ‘continuum’ of state-imposed punishments . . . , parol-
ees have [even] fewer expectations of privacy than probationers, be-
cause parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is to im-
prisonment.” 354 The Fourth Amendment, therefore, is not violated
by a warrantless search of a parolee that is predicated upon a pa-
role condition to which a prisoner agreed to observe during the bal-
ance of his sentence.355
    Drug Testing.—In two 1989 decisions the Court held that no
warrant, probable cause, or even individualized suspicion is re-
quired for mandatory drug testing of certain classes of railroad and
public employees. In each case, “special needs beyond the normal
need for law enforcement” were identified as justifying the drug test-
ing. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n,356 the Court up-
held regulations requiring railroads to administer blood, urine, and
breath tests to employees involved in certain train accidents or vio-
lating certain safety rules; in National Treasury Employees Union
v. Von Raab 357 the Court upheld a Customs Service screening pro-
gram requiring urine testing of employees seeking transfer or pro-
motion to positions having direct involvement with drug interdic-
tion, or to positions requiring the incumbent to carry firearms.
     The Court in Skinner found a “compelling” governmental inter-
est in testing the railroad employees without any showing of indi-
vidualized suspicion, since operation of trains by anyone impaired
by drugs “can cause great human loss before any signs of impair-
ment become noticeable.” 358 By contrast, the intrusions on privacy
were termed “limited.” Blood and breath tests were passed off as
routine; the urine test, although more intrusive, was deemed per-
missible because of the “diminished expectation of privacy” in em-
ployees having some responsibility for safety in a pervasively regu-
lated industry. 359 The lower court’s emphasis on the limited
effectiveness of the urine test (it detects past drug use but not nec-
essarily the level of impairment) was misplaced, the Court ruled.
It is enough that the test may provide some useful information for

to “agree in writing to be subject to a search or seizure by a parole officer or other
peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and
with or without cause.” Id. at 846, quoting Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 3067(a).
