    “Open Fields”.—In Hester v. United States,312 the Court held
that the Fourth Amendment did not protect “open fields” and that,
therefore, police searches in such areas as pastures, wooded areas,
open water, and vacant lots need not comply with the require-
ments of warrants and probable cause. The Court’s announcement
in Katz v. United States 313 that the Amendment protects “people
not places” cast some doubt on the vitality of the open fields prin-
ciple, but all such doubts were cast away in Oliver v. United States.314
Invoking Hester’s reliance on the literal wording of the Fourth Amend-
ment (open fields are not “effects”) and distinguishing Katz, the Court
ruled that the open fields exception applies to fields that are fenced
and posted. “[A]n individual may not legitimately demand privacy
for activities conducted out of doors in fields, except in the area im-
mediately surrounding the home.” 315 Nor may an individual de-
mand privacy for activities conducted within outbuildings and vis-
ible by trespassers peering into the buildings from just outside.316
Even within the curtilage and notwithstanding that the owner has
gone to the extreme of erecting a 10-foot high fence in order to screen
the area from ground-level view, there is no reasonable expectation
of privacy from naked-eye inspection from fixed-wing aircraft flying
in navigable airspace.317 Similarly, naked-eye inspection from heli-
copters flying even lower contravenes no reasonable expectation of
privacy.318 And aerial photography of commercial facilities secured

     316 United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987) (space immediately outside a

barn, accessible only after crossing a series of “ranch-style” fences and situated one-
half mile from the public road, constitutes unprotected “open field”).
     317 California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986). Activities within the curtilage are

nonetheless still entitled to some Fourth Amendment protection. The Court has de-
scribed four considerations for determining whether an area falls within the curtilage:
proximity to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure also sur-
rounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps
taken by the resident to shield the area from view of passersby. United States v.
Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987) (barn 50 yards outside of fence surrounding home, used
for processing chemicals, and separated from public access only by a series of live-
stock fences, by a chained and locked driveway, and by one-half mile’s distance, is
not within curtilage).

house).
