case that the “warrants-with-narrow-exceptions” standard nor-
mally prevails over a “reasonableness” approach.23 Exceptions to the
warrant requirement have multiplied, tending to confine applica-
tion of the requirement to cases that are exclusively “criminal” in
nature. And even within that core area of “criminal” cases, some
exceptions have been broadened.
     The most important category of exception is that of administra-
tive searches justified by “special needs beyond the normal need for
law enforcement.” Under this general rubric the Court has upheld
warrantless searches by administrative authorities in public schools,
government offices, and prisons, and has upheld drug testing of pub-
lic and transportation employees.24 In all of these instances, the war-
rant and probable cause requirements are dispensed with in favor
of a reasonableness standard that balances the government’s regu-
latory interest against the individual’s privacy interest; in all of these
instances, the government’s interest has been found to outweigh the
individual’s. The broad scope of the administrative search excep-
tion is evidenced by the fact that an overlap between law enforce-
ment objectives and administrative “special needs” does not result
in application of the warrant requirement; instead, the Court has
upheld warrantless inspection of automobile junkyards and disman-
tling operations in spite of the strong law enforcement component
of the regulation.25
    Warrant requirements and individualized suspicion at times are
also set aside in a pure law enforcement context in favor of a rea-
sonableness test that balances governmental and individual inter-
ests. The outcome in these cases may depend on how the respec-
tive interests at stake are characterized. For example, in Maryland
v. King, the five-Justice majority and four-Justice dissent clashed
over what governmental interests were served by a law allowing
for DNA testing of suspects being taken into custody after being

413 U.S. 266 (1973) (warrantless stop and search of auto by roving patrol near bor-
der); Marshall v. Barrow’s, Inc., 436 U.S. 307 (1978) (warrantless administrative in-
spection of business premises); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385 (1978) (warrantless
search of home that was “homicide scene”); Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–
542 (2009) (search of vehicle incident to arrest where arrestee had no access to ve-
hicle).
     23 Of the Justices on the Court in 1992, only Justice Stevens frequently sided

with the warrants-with-narrow-exceptions approach. See, e.g., Illinois v. Rodriguez,
497 U.S. 177, 189 (Justice Stevens joining Justice Marshall’s dissent); New Jersey
v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 370 (1985) (Justice Stevens dissenting); California v. Acevedo,
500 U.S. 565, 585 (1991) (Justice Stevens dissenting).
