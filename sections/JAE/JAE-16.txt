a felony were permitted,66 and this history is reflected in the fact
that the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the arrest is made in a
public place on probable cause, regardless of whether a warrant has
been obtained.67 However, in order to effectuate an arrest in the
home, absent consent or exigent circumstances, police officers must
have a warrant.68
    The Fourth Amendment applies to “seizures” and it is not nec-
essary that a detention be a formal arrest in order to bring to bear
the requirements of warrants, or probable cause in instances in which
warrants are not required.69 Some objective justification must be
shown to validate all seizures of the person,70 including seizures

     65 Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480, 485–86 (1958); United States v.

Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 416–18 (1976); Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 583–86
(1980); Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 211–13 (1981).
     66 1 J. STEPHEN, A HISTORY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW OF ENGLAND 193 (1883). At common

law warrantless arrest was also permissible for some misdemeanors not involving a
breach of the peace. See the lengthy historical treatment in Atwater v. City of Lago
Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 326–45 (2001).
     67 United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411 (1976). See also United States v. Santana,

427 U.S. 38 (1976) (sustaining warrantless arrest of suspect in her home when she
was initially approached in her doorway and then retreated into house). However, a
suspect arrested on probable cause but without a warrant is entitled to a prompt,
nonadversary hearing before a magistrate under procedures designed to provide a
fair and reliable determination of probable cause in order to keep the arrestee in
custody. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975). A “prompt” hearing now means a
hearing that is administratively convenient. See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,
500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991) (authorizing “as a general matter” detention for up to 48
hours without a probable-cause hearing, after which time the burden shifts to the
government to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying further deten-
tion).
     68 Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980) (voiding state law authorizing police

to enter private residence without a warrant to make an arrest); Steagald v. United
States, 451 U.S. 204 (1981) (officers with arrest warrant for A entered B’s home with-
out search warrant and discovered incriminating evidence; violated Fourth Amend-
ment in absence of warrant to search the home); Hayes v. Florida, 470 U.S. 811
(1985) (officers went to suspect’s home and took him to police station for fingerprint-
ing).
     69 United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (“a person has been

‘seized’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the cir-
cumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that
he was not free to leave”). See also Reid v. Georgia, 448 U.S. 438 (1980); United
States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16–19
(1968); Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U.S. 626 (2003). Apprehension by the use of deadly force
is a seizure subject to the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement. See,
e.g., Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985) (police officer’s fatal shooting of a flee-
ing suspect); Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593 (1989) (police roadblock de-
signed to end car chase with fatal crash); Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007) (po-
lice officer’s ramming fleeing motorist’s car from behind in attempt to stop him).
     70 The justification must be made to a neutral magistrate, not to the arrestee.

There is no constitutional requirement that an officer inform an arrestee of the rea-
son for his arrest. Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 155 (2004) (the offense for
which there is probable cause to arrest need not be closely related to the offense
stated by the officer at the time of arrest).
