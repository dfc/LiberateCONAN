sequently raise those claims on federal habeas corpus because, the
Court found, the costs outweigh the minimal deterrent effect.459
    The exclusionary rule is inapplicable in parole revocation hear-
ings,460 and a violation of the “knock-and-announce” rule (the pro-
cedure that police officers must follow to announce their presence
before entering a residence with a lawful warrant) 461 does not re-
quire suppression of the evidence gathered pursuant to a search.462
If an arrest or a search that was valid at the time it took place
becomes bad through the subsequent invalidation of the statute un-
der which the arrest or search was made, the Court has held that
evidence obtained thereby is nonetheless admissible.463 In other cases,
a grand jury witness was required to answer questions even though
the questions were based on evidence obtained from an unlawful
search and seizure,464 and federal tax authorities were permitted
in a civil proceeding to use evidence that had been unconstitution-
ally seized from a defendant by state authorities.465

    459  Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976).
    460  Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U.S. 357 (1998).
     461 The “knock and announce” requirement is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3109, and

the Court has held that the rule is also part of the Fourth Amendment reasonable-
ness inquiry. Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927 (1995).
     462 Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586 (2006). Writing for the majority, Justice

Scalia explained that the exclusionary rule was inappropriate because the purpose
of the knock-and-announce requirement was to protect human life, property, and the
homeowner’s privacy and dignity; the requirement has never protected an individu-
al’s interest in preventing seizure of evidence described in a warrant. Id. at 594.
Furthermore, the Court believed that the “substantial social costs” of applying the
exclusionary rule would outweigh the benefits of deterring knock-and-announce vio-
lations by applying it. Id. The Court also reasoned that other means of deterrence,
such as civil remedies, were available and effective, and that police forces have be-
come increasingly professional and respectful of constitutional rights in the past half-
century. Id. at 599. Justice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion emphasizing that
“the continued operation of the exclusionary rule . . . is not in doubt.” Id. at 603. In
dissent, Justice Breyer asserted that the majority’s decision “weakens, perhaps de-
stroys, much of the practical value of the Constitution’s knock-and-announce protec-
tion.” Id. at 605.
     463 Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31 (1979) (statute creating substantive crimi-

nal offense). Statutes that authorize unconstitutional searches and seizures but which
have not yet been voided at the time of the search or seizure may not create this
effect, however, Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465 (1979); Ybarra v. Illinois, 444
U.S. 85 (1979). This aspect of Torres and Ybarra was to a large degree nullified by
Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987), rejecting a distinction between substantive and
procedural statutes and holding the exclusionary rule inapplicable in the case of a
police officer’s objectively reasonable reliance on a statute later held to violate the
Fourth Amendment. Similarly, the exclusionary rule does not require suppression of
evidence that was seized incident to an arrest that was the result of a clerical error
by a court clerk. Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995).
     464 United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974).
     465 United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433 (1976). Similarly, the rule is inappli-

cable in civil proceedings for deportation of aliens. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S.
1032 (1984).
