ris v. United States,239 the Court approved a search of a four-room
apartment pursuant to an arrest under warrant for one crime, where
the search turned up evidence of another crime. A year later, in
Trupiano v. United States,240 a raid on a distillery resulted in the
arrest of a man found on the premises and a seizure of the equip-
ment; the Court reversed the conviction because the officers had had
time to obtain a search warrant and had not done so. “A search or
seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has al-
ways been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of
the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest.
But there must be something more in the way of necessity than
merely a lawful arrest.” 241
     The Court overruled Trupiano in United States v. Rabinowitz,242
in which officers had arrested the defendant in his one-room office
pursuant to an arrest warrant and proceeded to search the room
completely. The Court observed that the issue was not whether the
officers had the time and opportunity to obtain a search warrant
but whether the search incident to arrest was reasonable. Though
Rabinowitz referred to searches of the area within the arrestee’s
“immediate control,” 243 it provided no standard by which this area
was to be determined, and extensive searches were permitted un-
der the rule.244
     In Chimel v. California,245 however, a narrower view was as-
serted, the primacy of warrants was again emphasized, and a stan-
dard by which the scope of searches pursuant to arrest could be
ascertained was set out. “When an arrest is made, it is reasonable
for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to
remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to
resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer’s safety might

     244 Cf. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 764–65 & n.10 (1969). But, in Kre-

men v. United States, 353 U.S. 346 (1957), the Court held that the seizure of the
entire contents of a house and the removal to F.B.I. offices 200 miles away for exami-
nation, pursuant to an arrest under warrant of one of the persons found in the house,
was unreasonable. In decisions contemporaneous to and subsequent to Chimel, ap-
plying pre-Chimel standards because that case was not retroactive, Williams v. United
States, 401 U.S. 646 (1971), the Court has applied Rabinowitz somewhat restric-
tively. See Von Cleef v. New Jersey, 395 U.S. 814 (1969), which followed Kremen;
Shipley v. California, 395 U.S. 818 (1969), and Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U.S. 30 (1970)
(both involving arrests outside the house with subsequent searches of the house);
Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 455–57 (1971). Substantially extensive
searches were, however, approved in Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646 (1971),
and Hill v. California, 401 U.S. 797 (1971).
