held that “reviewing the transcripts was reasonable because it was
an efficient and expedient way to determine whether [the officer’s]
overages were the result of work-related messaging or personal use.” 342
     Prisoners, Probatitoners, and Parolees.—The “undoubted se-
curity imperatives involved in jail supervision” require “defer[ence]
to the judgment of correctional officials unless the record contains
substantial evidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or
unjustified response to the problems of jail security.” 343 So saying,
the Court, in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, upheld rou-
tine strip searches, including close-up visual cavity inspections, as
part of processing new arrestees for entry into the general inmate
population, without the need for individualized suspicion and with-
out an exception for those arrested for minor offenses.344 Correc-
tional officials had asserted significant penological interests to jus-
tify routine strip searches of new arrivals: detecting and preventing
the introduction into the inmate population of infections, infesta-
tions, and contraband of all sorts; and identifying gang members.
Having cited serious concerns and having applied their profes-
sional expertise, the officials had, in the Court’s opinion, acted rea-
sonably and not clearly overreacted. But despite taking a deferen-
tial approach and recounting the grave dangers correctional officers
face, the Florence Court did not hold that individuals being pro-
cessed for detention have no privacy rights at all. In separate con-
currences, moreover, two members of the five-Justice majority held
out the prospect of exceptions and refinements in future rulings on
blanket strip search policies for new detainees.345
     A legitimate interest in having safe and accurate booking proce-
dures to identify persons being taken into custody was prominently
cited by the Court in Maryland v. King to sustain taking DNA samples
from those charged with serious crimes.346 In the Court’s opinion,
tapping the “unmatched potential of DNA identification” facilitates
knowing with certainty who the arrestee is, his criminal history and

detention facilities.” 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–945, slip op. at 1 (2012).

ers, a strip search of the kind conducted in Florence is unconstitutional if given to
an arriving detainee arrested for a minor offense not involving violence or drugs,
absent a reasonable suspicion to believe that the new arrival possesses contraband.
