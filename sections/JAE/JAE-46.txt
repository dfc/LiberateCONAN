    Search Incident to Arrest.—The common-law rule permit-
ting searches of the person of an arrestee as an incident to the ar-
rest has occasioned little controversy in the Court.234 The Court has
even upheld a search incident to an illegal (albeit not unconstitu-
tional) arrest.235 The dispute has centered around the scope of the
search. Because it was the stated general rule that the scope of a
warrantless search must be strictly tied to and justified by the cir-
cumstances that rendered its justification permissible, and because
it was the rule that the justification of a search of the arrestee was
to prevent destruction of evidence and to prevent access to a weapon,236
it was argued to the court that a search of the person of the defen-
dant arrested for a traffic offense, which discovered heroin in a
crumpled cigarette package, was impermissible, because there could
have been no destructible evidence relating to the offense for which
he was arrested and no weapon could have been concealed in the
cigarette package. The Court rejected this argument, ruling that “no
additional justification” is required for a custodial arrest of a sus-
pect based on probable cause.237
   However, the Justices have long found themselves in disagree-
ment about the scope of the search incident to arrest as it extends
beyond the person to the area in which the person is arrested—
most commonly either his premises or his vehicle. Certain early cases
went both ways on the basis of some fine distinctions,238 but in Har-

     234 Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392 (1914); Carroll v. United States,

267 U.S. 132, 158 (1925); Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 30 (1925).
     235 Virginia v. Moore, 128 S. Ct. 1598 (2008) (holding that, where an arrest for

a minor offense is prohibited by state law, the arrest will not violate the Fourth
Amendment if it was based on probable cause).
     236 Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762,

763 (1969).
     237 United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235 (1973). See also id. at 237–38

(Justice Powell concurring). The Court applied the same rule in Gustafson v. Florida,
414 U.S. 260 (1973), involving a search of a motorist’s person following his custodial
arrest for an offense for which a citation would normally have issued. Unlike the
situation in Robinson, police regulations did not require the Gustafson officer to take
the suspect into custody, nor did a departmental policy guide the officer as to when
to conduct a full search. The Court found these differences inconsequential, and left
for another day the problem of pretextual arrests in order to obtain basis to search.
Soon thereafter, the Court upheld conduct of a similar search at the place of deten-
tion, even after a time lapse between the arrest and search. United States v. Ed-
wards, 415 U.S. 800 (1974).
     On occasion, an opinion will maintain that a warrantless search incident to ar-
rest must be aimed at weapons or contraband or at evidence of the crime of arrest.

(objecting to DNA testing incident to arrest for a serious crime).
