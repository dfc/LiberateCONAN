where there had been an invasion—a technical trespass—
electronic surveillance was deemed subject to Fourth Amendment
restrictions.38
    The Court later rejected this approach. “The premise that prop-
erty interests control the right of the government to search and seize
has been discredited. . . . We have recognized that the principal ob-
ject of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy rather
than property, and have increasingly discarded fictional and proce-
dural barriers rested on property concepts.” 39 Thus, because the
Amendment “protects people, not places,” the requirement of ac-
tual physical trespass is dispensed with and electronic surveillance
was made subject to the Amendment’s requirements.40
    The new test, propounded in Katz v. United States, is whether
there is an expectation of privacy upon which one may “justifiably”
rely.41 “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his
own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protec-
tion. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area ac-
cessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” 42 That is,
the “capacity to claim the protection of the Amendment depends not
upon a property right in the invaded place but upon whether the
area was one in which there was reasonable expectation of freedom
from governmental intrusion.” 43

     41 389 U.S. at 353. Justice Harlan, concurring, formulated a two pronged test

for determining whether the privacy interest is paramount: “first that a person have
exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expecta-
tion be one that society is prepared to recognize as ‘reasonable.’ ” Id. at 361.

premises nor the papers seized). Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 (1990) (overnight

hours for the purpose of bagging cocaine for later sale has no legitimate expectation
of privacy); Cf. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978) (auto passengers demonstrated
no legitimate expectation of privacy in glove compartment or under seat of auto).
Property rights are still protected by the Amendment, however. A “seizure” of prop-
erty can occur when there is some meaningful interference with an individual’s pos-
sessory interests in that property, and regardless of whether there is any interfer-
ence with the individual’s privacy interest. Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56 (1992)
