the moment the car comes to a halt, and the passengers as well as
the driver may challenge the constitutionality of the stop.269 Like-
wise, a police officer may frisk (patdown for weapons) both the driver
and any passengers whom he reasonably concludes “might be armed
and presently dangerous.” 270
    By contrast, fixed-checkpoint stops in the absence of any indi-
vidualized suspicion have been upheld for purposes of promoting
highway safety 271 or policing the international border,272 but not
for more generalized law enforcement purposes.273 Once police have
validly stopped a vehicle, they may also, based on articulable facts
warranting a reasonable belief that weapons may be present, con-
duct a Terry-type protective search of those portions of the passen-
ger compartment in which a weapon could be placed or hidden.274
And, in the absence of such reasonable suspicion as to weapons,
police may seize contraband and suspicious items “in plain view”
inside the passenger compartment.275
     Although officers who have stopped a car to issue a routine traf-
fic citation may conduct a Terry-type search, even including a pat-
down of driver and passengers if there is reasonable suspicion that
they are armed and dangerous, they may not conduct a full-blown

     271 Michigan Dep’t of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990) (upholding a so-

briety checkpoint at which all motorists are briefly stopped for preliminary question-
ing and observation for signs of intoxication).
     272 United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976) (upholding border pa-

trol checkpoint, over 60 miles from the border, for questioning designed to appre-
hend illegal aliens). See also United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149 (2004)
(upholding a search at the border involving disassembly of a vehicle’s fuel tank).
     273 City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000) (vehicle checkpoint set

up for the “primary purpose [of] detect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdo-
ing” (here interdicting illegal narcotics) does not fall within the highway safety or
border patrol exception to the individualized suspicion requirement, and hence vio-
lates the Fourth Amendment). Edmond was distinguished in Illinois v. Lidster, 540
U.S. 419 (2004), upholding use of a checkpoint to ask motorists for help in solving a
recent hit-and-run accident that had resulted in death. The public interest in solv-
ing the crime was deemed “grave,” while the interference with personal liberty was
deemed minimal.
     274 Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983) (holding that contraband found

in the course of such a search is admissible).
     275 Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730 (1983). Similarly, because there is no reason-

able privacy interest in the vehicle identification number, required by law to be placed
on the dashboard so as to be visible through the windshield, police may reach into
the passenger compartment to remove items obscuring the number and may seize
items in plain view while doing so. New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106 (1986). And,
because there also is no legitimate privacy interest in possessing contraband, and
because properly conducted canine sniffs are “generally likely, to reveal only the pres-
ence of contraband,” police may conduct a canine sniff around the perimeter of a
vehicle stopped for a traffic offense. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 409 (2005).
