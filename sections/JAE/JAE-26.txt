termined according to “the factual and practical considerations of
everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal tech-
nicians, act.” 112 Warrants are favored in the law and their use will
not be thwarted by a hypertechnical reading of the supporting affi-
davit and supporting testimony.113 For the same reason, reviewing
courts will accept evidence of a less “judicially competent or persua-
sive character than would have justified an officer in acting on his
own without a warrant.” 114 Courts will sustain the determination
of probable cause so long as “there was substantial basis for [the
magistrate] to conclude that” there was probable cause.115
     Much litigation has concerned the sufficiency of the complaint
to establish probable cause. Mere conclusory assertions are not
enough.116 In United States v. Ventresca,117 however, an affidavit by
a law enforcement officer asserting his belief that an illegal distill-
ery was being operated in a certain place, explaining that the be-
lief was based upon his own observations and upon those of fellow
investigators, and detailing a substantial amount of these personal
observations clearly supporting the stated belief, was held to be suf-
ficient to constitute probable cause. “Recital of some of the underly-
ing circumstances in the affidavit is essential,” the Court said, ob-
serving that “where these circumstances are detailed, where reason
for crediting the source of the information is given, and when a mag-
istrate has found probable cause,” the reliance on the warrant pro-
cess should not be deterred by insistence on too stringent a show-
ing.118
    Requirements for establishing probable cause through reliance
on information received from an informant has divided the Court
    112  Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175 (1949).
    113  United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108–09 (1965).
     114 Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 270–71 (1960). Similarly, the prefer-

ence for proceeding by warrant leads to a stricter rule for appellate review of trial
court decisions on warrantless stops and searches than is employed to review prob-
able cause to issue a warrant. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996) (deter-
minations of reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause to search without a
warrant should be subjected to de novo appellate review).
     115 Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 111 (1964). It must be emphasized that the

issuing party “must judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on by a
[complainant] to show probable cause.” Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480,
486 (1958). An insufficient affidavit cannot be rehabilitated by testimony after issu-
ance concerning information possessed by the affiant but not disclosed to the magis-
trate. Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560 (1971).
     116 Byars v. United States, 273 U.S. 28 (1927) (affiant stated he “has good rea-

son to believe and does believe” that defendant has contraband materials in his pos-
session); Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480 (1958) (complainant merely stated
his conclusion that defendant had committed a crime). See also Nathanson v. United
States, 290 U.S. 41 (1933).
