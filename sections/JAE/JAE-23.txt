the Court, without acknowledging the magnitude of the leap from
one context to another, has taken the Dewey/Burger rationale—
developed to justify warrantless searches of business establishments—
and applied it to justify the significant intrusion into personal pri-
vacy represented by urinalysis drug testing. Because of the history
of pervasive regulation of the railroad industry, the Court rea-
soned, railroad employees have a diminished expectation of privacy
that makes mandatory urinalysis less intrusive and more reason-
able.100
    With respect to automobiles, the holdings are mixed. Random
stops of automobiles to check drivers’ licenses, vehicle registra-
tions, and safety conditions were condemned as too intrusive; the
degree to which random stops would advance the legitimate govern-
mental interests involved did not outweigh the individual’s legiti-
mate expectations of privacy.101 On the other hand, in South Da-
kota v. Opperman,102 the Court sustained the admission of evidence
found when police impounded an automobile from a public street
for multiple parking violations and entered the car to secure and
inventory valuables for safekeeping. Marijuana was discovered in
the glove compartment.

Searches and Seizures Pursuant to Warrant
    Emphasis upon the necessity of warrants places the judgment
of an independent magistrate between law enforcement officers and
the privacy of citizens, authorizes invasion of that privacy only upon
a showing that constitutes probable cause, and limits that invasion
by specification of the person to be seized, the place to be searched,

(neither probable cause nor individualized suspicion is necessary for mandatory drug
testing of railway employees involved in accidents or safety violations). All of these
cases are discussed infra under the general heading “Valid Searches and Seizures
Without Warrants.”

taining admission of criminal evidence found when police conducted a warrantless
search of an out-of-state policeman’s automobile following an accident, in order to
find and safeguard his service revolver). The Court in both cases emphasized the
reduced expectation of privacy in automobiles and the noncriminal purposes of the
searches.
