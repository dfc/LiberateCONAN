    Property Subject to Seizure.—There has never been any doubt
that search warrants could be issued for the seizure of contraband
and the fruits and instrumentalities of crime.143 But, in Gouled v.
United States,144 a unanimous Court limited the classes of prop-
erty subject to seizures to these three and refused to permit a sei-
zure of “mere evidence,” in this instance papers of the defendant
that were to be used as evidence against him at trial. The Court
recognized that there was “no special sanctity in papers, as distin-
guished from other forms of property, to render them immune from
search and seizure,” 145 but their character as evidence rendered them
immune. This immunity “was based upon the dual, related prem-
ises that historically the right to search for and seize property de-
pended upon the assertion by the Government of a valid claim of
superior interest, and that it was not enough that the purpose of
the search and seizure was to obtain evidence to use in apprehend-
ing and convicting criminals.” 146 More evaded than followed, the
“mere evidence” rule was overturned in 1967.147 It is now settled
that such evidentiary items as fingerprints, 148 blood, 149 urine
samples,150 fingernail and skin scrapings,151 voice and handwriting
exemplars,152 conversations,153 and other demonstrative evidence may

ers engaged in disseminating communications to the public, unless there is prob-
able cause to believe the person protecting the materials has committed or is com-
mitting the crime to which the materials relate.
     143 United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452, 465–66 (1932). Of course, evidence

seizable under warrant is subject to seizure without a warrant in circumstances in
which warrantless searches are justified.
     144 255 U.S. 298 (1921). United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452 (1932), ap-

plied the rule in a warrantless search of premises. The rule apparently never ap-
plied in case of a search of the person. Cf. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757
(1966).
     145 Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298, 306 (1921).
     146 Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 303 (1967). See Gouled v. United States,

255 U.S. 298, 309 (1921). The holding was derived from dicta in Boyd v. United
States, 116 U.S. 616, 624–29 (1886).
     147 Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967).
     148 Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969).
     149 Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966); Skinner v. Railway Labor Ex-

ecutives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989) (warrantless blood testing for drug use by rail-
road employee involved in accident).
     150 Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989) (warrant-

less drug testing of railroad employee involved in accident).
     151 Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U.S. 291 (1973) (sustaining warrantless taking of scrap-

ings from defendant’s fingernails at the station house, on the basis that it was a
very limited intrusion and necessary to preserve evanescent evidence).
     152 United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973); United States v. Mara, 410 U.S.

19 (1973) (both sustaining grand jury subpoenas to produce voice and handwriting
exemplars, as no reasonable expectation of privacy exists with respect to those items).
     153 Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 44 n.2 (1967). See also id. at 97 n.4, 107–08

(Justices Harlan and White concurring), 67 (Justice Douglas concurring).
