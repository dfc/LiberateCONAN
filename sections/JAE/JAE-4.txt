other places in search of materials connected with John Wilkes’ po-
lemical pamphlets attacking not only governmental policies but the
King himself.4
     Entick, an associate of Wilkes, sued because agents had forc-
ibly broken into his house, broken into locked desks and boxes, and
seized many printed charts, pamphlets, and the like. In an opinion
sweeping in terms, the court declared the warrant and the behav-
ior it authorized subversive “of all the comforts of society,” and the
issuance of a warrant for the seizure of all of a person’s papers rather
than only those alleged to be criminal in nature “contrary to the
genius of the law of England.” 5 Besides its general character, the
court said, the warrant was bad because it was not issued on a show-
ing of probable cause and no record was required to be made of
what had been seized. Entick v. Carrington, the Supreme Court has
said, is a “great judgment,” “one of the landmarks of English lib-
erty,” “one of the permanent monuments of the British Constitu-
tion,” and a guide to an understanding of what the Framers meant
in writing the Fourth Amendment.6
    In the colonies, smuggling rather than seditious libel afforded
the leading examples of the necessity for protection against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures. In order to enforce the revenue laws,
English authorities made use of writs of assistance, which were gen-
eral warrants authorizing the bearer to enter any house or other
place to search for and seize “prohibited and uncustomed” goods,
and commanding all subjects to assist in these endeavors. Once is-
sued, the writs remained in force throughout the lifetime of the sov-
ereign and six months thereafter. When, upon the death of George
II in 1760, the authorities were required to obtain the issuance of
new writs, opposition was led by James Otis, who attacked such
writs on libertarian grounds and who asserted the invalidity of the
authorizing statutes because they conflicted with English constitu-
tionalism.7 Otis lost and the writs were issued and used, but his
arguments were much cited in the colonies not only on the immedi-
ate subject but also with regard to judicial review.
