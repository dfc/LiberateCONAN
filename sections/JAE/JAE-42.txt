application of the tests, the Court was initially restrictive in recog-
nizing permissible bases for reasonable suspicion.212 Extensive in-
trusions on individual privacy, e.g., transportation to the station house
for interrogation and fingerprinting, were invalidated in the ab-
sence of probable cause,213 although the Court has held that an un-
corroborated, anonymous tip is insufficient basis for a Terry stop,
and that there is no “firearms” exception to the reasonable suspi-
cion requirement.214 More recently, however, the Court has taken
less restrictive approaches.215
     It took the Court some time to settle on a test for when a “sei-
zure” has occurred, and the Court has recently modified its ap-
proach. The issue is of some importance, since it is at this point
that Fourth Amendment protections take hold. The Terry Court rec-
ognized in dictum that “not all personal intercourse between police-
men and citizens involves ‘seizures’ of persons,” and suggested that
“[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or show of au-
thority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we
conclude that a ‘seizure’ has occurred.” 216 Years later Justice Stew-
art proposed a similar standard—that a person has been seized “only
if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a
reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to

the circumstances. “Based upon that whole picture the detaining officer must have
a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of
criminal activity.” Id. at 417–18. The inquiry is thus quite fact-specific. In the anony-
mous tip context, the same basic approach requiring some corroboration applies re-
gardless of whether the standard is probable cause or reasonable suspicion; the dif-
ference is that less information, or less reliable information, can satisfy the lower
standard. Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990).
     212 E.g., Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979) (individual’s presence in high crime

area gave officer no articulable basis to suspect him of crime); Delaware v. Prouse,
440 U.S. 648 (1979) (reasonable suspicion of a license or registration violation is
necessary to authorize automobile stop; random stops impermissible); United States
v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975) (officers could not justify random automobile
stop solely on basis of Mexican appearance of occupants); Reid v. Georgia, 448 U.S.
438 (1980) (no reasonable suspicion for airport stop based on appearance that sus-
pect and another passenger were trying to conceal the fact that they were traveling
together). But cf. United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976) (halting ve-
hicles at fixed checkpoints to question occupants as to citizenship and immigration
status permissible, even if officers should act on basis of appearance of occupants).
     213 Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 (1969); Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S.

200 (1979). Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119 (2000) (unprovoked flight from high
crime area upon sight of police produces “reasonable suspicion”).
     214 Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000) (reasonable suspicion requires that a tip

be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not merely in its identification of someone).
     215 See, e.g., United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221 (1985) (reasonable suspi-

cion to stop a motorist may be based on a “wanted flyer” as long as issuance of the
flyer has been based on reasonable suspicion); United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1,
9 (1989) (airport stop based on drug courier profile may rely on a combination of
factors that individually may be “quite consistent with innocent travel”).
