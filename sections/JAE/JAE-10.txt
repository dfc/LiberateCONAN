with this country. There is no resulting broad principle, however,
that the Fourth Amendment constrains federal officials wherever and
against whomever they act.
     The Interest Protected.—For the Fourth Amendment to ap-
ply to a particular set of facts, there must be a “search” and a “sei-
zure,” occurring typically in a criminal case, with a subsequent at-
tempt to use judicially what was seized.33 Whether there was a search
and seizure within the meaning of the Amendment, and whether a
complainant’s interests were constitutionally infringed, will often turn
upon consideration of his interest and whether it was officially abused.
What does the Amendment protect? Under the common law, there
was no doubt. In Entick v. Carrington,34 Lord Camden wrote: “The
great end for which men entered in society was to secure their prop-
erty. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all in-
stances where it has not been taken away or abridged by some pub-
lic law for the good of the whole. . . . By the laws of England, every
invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass. No
man can set foot upon my ground without my license but he is li-
able to an action though the damage be nothing . . . .” Protection
of property interests as the basis of the Fourth Amendment found
easy acceptance in the Supreme Court 35 and that acceptance con-
trolled the decision in numerous cases.36 For example, in Olmstead
v. United States,37 one of the two premises underlying the holding
that wiretapping was not covered by the Amendment was that there
had been no actual physical invasion of the defendant’s premises;



     33 See, e.g., California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991) (because there was

no “seizure” of the defendant as he fled from police before being tackled, the drugs
that he abandoned in flight could not be excluded as the fruits of an unreasonable
seizure).

     36 Thus, the rule that “mere evidence” could not be seized but rather only the

fruits of crime, its instrumentalities, or contraband, turned upon the question of the
right of the public to possess the materials or the police power to make possession
by the possessor unlawful. Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298 (1921), overruled
by Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967). See also Davis v. United States, 328
U.S. 582 (1946). Standing to contest unlawful searches and seizures was based upon
property interests, United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48 (1951); Jones v. United States,
362 U.S. 257 (1960), as well as decision upon the validity of a consent to search.
