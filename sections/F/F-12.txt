mit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States,
directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Sen-
ate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Represen-
tatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be
counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall
be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole
Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one
who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes,
then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by
Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Major-
ity, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall
in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the Presi-
dent, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representatives
from each State having one Vote; a quorum for this Purpose shall
consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States,
and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice.
In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person hav-
ing the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the
Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have
equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice
President.
    The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Elec-
tors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which
Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the
United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,
shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any per-
son be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the
Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within
the United States.
