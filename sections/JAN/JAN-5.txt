section 1 of the Amendment against private parties.9 In 1968, how-
ever, the Court overturned almost century-old precedent and held
that Congress may regulate private activity in exercise of its sec-
tion 2 power to enforce section 1 of the Amendment.
    Certain early cases suggested broad congressional powers,10 but
the Civil Rights Cases 11 of 1883 began a process, culminating in
Hodges v. United States,12 that substantially curtailed these pow-
ers. In the former decision, the Court held unconstitutional an 1875
law 13 guaranteeing equality of access to public accommodations. Re-
ferring to the Thirteenth Amendment, the Court conceded that “leg-
islation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases
and circumstances to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes
of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation
may be primary and direct in its character; for the amendment is
not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slav-
ery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servi-
tude shall not exist in any part of the United States.” Appropriate
legislation under the Amendment, the Court continued, could go be-
yond nullifying state laws establishing or upholding slavery, be-
cause the Amendment “has a reflex character also, establishing and
decreeing universal civil and political freedom throughout the United
States,” and thereby empowering Congress “to pass all laws neces-
sary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery
in the United States.” 14
    These badges and incidents as perceived by the Court, how-
ever, were those that Congress in its 1866 legislation 15 had sought
“to secure to all citizens of every race and color, and without re-
gard to previous servitude, those fundamental rights which are the
essence of civil freedom, namely the same right to make and en-
force contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, pur-
    9 In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439 (1968), the Court left open

the question whether the Amendment itself, unaided by legislation, would reach the
“badges and incidents” of slavery not directly associated with involuntary servitude,
and it continued to reserve the question in City of Memphis v. Greene, 451 U.S.
100, 125–26 (1981). See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 552 (1896) (Justice Har-
lan dissenting). The Court drew back from the possibility in Palmer v. Thompson,
403 U.S. 217, 226–27 (1971).
