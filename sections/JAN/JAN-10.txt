that contracts of seamen, involving to a certain extent the surren-
der of personal liberty, may be enforced without regard to the Amend-
ment.35 Similarly, enforcement of those duties that individuals owe
the government, “such as services in the army, militia, on the jury,
etc.,” is not covered.36 A state law requiring every able-bodied man
within its jurisdiction to labor for a reasonable time on public roads
near his residence without direct compensation was sustained.37 A
Thirteenth Amendment challenge to conscription for military ser-
vice was summarily rejected.38 A state law making it a misde-
meanor for a lessor, or his agent or janitor, intentionally to fail to
furnish such water, heat, light, elevator, telephone, or other ser-
vices as may be required by the terms of the lease and necessary
to the proper and customary use of the building was held not to
create an involuntary servitude.39 A federal statute making it un-
lawful to coerce, compel, or constrain a communications licensee to
employ persons in excess of the number of the employees needed to
conduct his business was held not to implicate the Amendment.40
Injunctions and cease and desist orders in labor disputes requiring
return to work do not violate the Amendment.41

    36  Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328, 333 (1916) (“the term involuntary servitude
was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery which
in practical operation would tend to produce like undesirable results,” id. at 332).
     37 Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328 (1916).
     38 Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918). The Court’s analysis, in full,

of the Thirteenth Amendment issue raised by a compulsory military draft was the
following: “as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by govern-
ment from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contrib-
uting to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation, as the result of a war
declared by the great representative body of the people, can be said to be the impo-
sition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is re-
futed by its mere statement.” Id. at 390.
     Although the Supreme Court has never squarely held that conscription need
not be premised on a declaration of war, indications are that the power is not con-
strained by the need for a formal declaration of war by “the great representative
body of the people.” During the Vietnam War (an undeclared war) the Court, uphold-
ing a conviction for burning a draft card, declared that the power to classify and
conscript manpower for military service was “beyond question.” United States v. O’Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). See also United States v. Holmes, 387 F.2d 781, 784 (7th
Cir. 1968) (“the power of Congress to raise armies and to take effective measures to
preserve their efficiency, is not limited by either the Thirteenth Amendment or the
absence of a military emergency”), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 936 (1968) (Justice Stew-
art concurring and Justice Douglas dissenting).
