man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If
Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much,
then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation can-
not keep.” 21
    The Thirteenth Amendment, then, could provide the constitu-
tional support for the various congressional enactments against pri-
vate racial discrimination that Congress had previously based on
the Commerce Clause.22 Because the 1866 Act contains none of the
limitations written into the modern laws, it has a vastly extensive
application.23

Peonage
    Notwithstanding its early acknowledgment in the Slaughter-
House Cases that peonage was comprehended within the slavery and
involuntary servitude proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment,24
the Court has had frequent occasion to determine whether state leg-
islation or the conduct of individuals has contributed to re-
establishment of that prohibited status. Defined as a condition of
enforced servitude by which the servitor is compelled to labor against
his will in liquidation of some debt or obligation, either real or pre-
tended, peonage was found to have been unconstitutionally sanc-
tioned by an Alabama statute, directed at defaulting sharecrop-
pers, which imposed a criminal liability and subjected to imprisonment
     21 Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 440–43 (1968). See also City of

Memphis v. Greene, 451 U.S. 100, 124–26 (1981).
     22 E.g., federal prohibition of racial discrimination in public accommodations, found

lacking in constitutional basis under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments
in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), was upheld as an exercise of the com-
merce power in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1965), and
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1965).
     23 The 1968 statute on housing and the 1866 act are compared in Jones v. Al-

fred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 413–17 (1968). The expansiveness of the 1866 stat-
ute and of congressional power is shown by Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396
U.S. 229 (1969) (1866 law protects share in a neighborhood recreational club which
ordinarily went with the lease or ownership of house in area); Runyon v. McCrary,
427 U.S. 160 (1976) (guarantee that all persons shall have the same right to make
and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white persons protects the right of black chil-
dren to gain admission to private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools); John-
son v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 459–60 (1975) (statute affords a fed-
eral remedy against discrimination in private employment on the basis of race);
McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 285–96 (1976) (statute pro-
tects against racial discrimination in private employment against whites as well as
nonwhites). See also Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass’n, 410 U.S. 431 (1973).
The Court has also concluded that pursuant to its Thirteenth Amendment powers
Congress could provide remedial legislation for African-Americans deprived of their
rights because of their race. Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 104–05 (1971). Con-
ceivably, the reach of the 1866 law could extend to all areas in which Congress has
so far legislated and to other areas as well, justifying legislative or judicial enforce-
ment of the Amendment itself in such areas as school segregation.
