two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives, the amendment
was forwarded to the states on February 1, 1865, and ratified by
the following December 18.4
    In selecting the text of the Amendment, Congress “reproduced
the historic words of the ordinance of 1787 for the government of
the Northwest Territory, and gave them unrestricted application within
the United States.” 5 By its adoption, Congress intended, said Sena-
tor Trumbull, one of its sponsors, to “take this question [of emanci-
pation] entirely away from the politics of the country. We relieve
Congress of sectional strifes . . . .” 6 An early Supreme Court deci-
sion, rejecting a contention that the Amendment reached servi-
tudes on property as it did on persons, observed in dicta that the
“word servitude is of larger meaning than slavery, . . . and the ob-
vious purpose was to forbid all shades and conditions of African slav-
ery.”
     Although the Court was initially in doubt whether persons other
than African-Americans could share in the protection afforded by
the Amendment, it did continue to say that, although “[N]egro slav-
ery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thir-
teenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereaf-
ter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop
slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this
amendment may safely be trusted to make it void.” 7
    “This Amendment . . . is undoubtedly self-executing without any
ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any exist-
ing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect it
abolished slavery, and established universal freedom.” 8 These words
of the Court in 1883 have generally been noncontroversial and have
evoked little disagreement in the intervening years. The “force and
effect” of the Amendment itself has been invoked only a few times
by the Court to strike down state legislation which it considered to
have reintroduced servitude of persons, and the Court has not used

ard noted that the language was “the good old Anglo-Saxon language employed by
our fathers in the ordinance of 1787, an expression which has been adjudicated upon
repeatedly, which is perfectly well understood both by the public and by judicial tri-
bunals. . . .” CONG. GLOBE, 38th Cong., 1st Sess. 1489 (1864).
