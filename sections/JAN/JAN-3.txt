                                 ABOLITION OF SLAVERY

        Origin and Purpose
             On January 1,1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation
        Proclamation 1 declaring, based on his war powers, that within named
        states and parts of states in rebellion against the United States “all
        persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of
        States, are, and henceforward shall be free . . . .” The Proclama-
        tion did not allude to slaves held in the loyal states, and, moreover,
        there were questions about the Proclamation’s validity. Not only was
        there doubt concerning the President’s power to issue his order at

            1 12 Stat. 1267. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had issued the preliminary Eman-

        cipation Proclamation, which announced his intention to issue the Emancipation Proc-
        lamation on January 1, 1863.
