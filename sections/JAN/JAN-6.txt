chase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citi-
zens.” 16 But the Court could not see that the refusal of accommodations
at an inn or a place of public amusement, without any sanction or
support from any state law, could inflict upon such person any man-
ner of servitude or form of slavery, as those terms were commonly
understood. “It would be running the slavery argument into the ground
to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may
see fit to make. . . .” 17
    Then, in Hodges v. United States,18 the Court set aside the con-
victions of three men for conspiring to drive several African-
Americans from their employment in a lumber mill. The Thir-
teenth Amendment operated to abolish, and to authorize Congress
to legislate to enforce abolition of, conditions of enforced compul-
sory service of one to another, and no attempt to analogize a pri-
vate impairment of freedom to a disability of slavery would suffice
to give the Federal Government jurisdiction over what was consti-
tutionally a matter of state remedial law.
    Hodges was overruled by the Court in a far-reaching decision
that concluded that the 1866 congressional enactment,19 far from
simply conferring on all persons the capacity to buy and sell prop-
erty, also prohibited private denials of the right through refusals to
deal,20 and that this statute was fully supportable by the Thir-
teenth Amendment. “Surely Congress has the power under the Thir-
teenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and
the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that deter-
mination into effective legislation. Nor can we say that the determi-
nation Congress has made is an irrational one. . . . Just as the Black
Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of
those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclu-
sion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for
the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into
ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color
of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery. . . . At the very least,
the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thir-
teenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white
