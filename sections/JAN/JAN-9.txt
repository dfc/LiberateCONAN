     Bailey v. Alabama was followed in Taylor v. Georgia 29 and Pol-
lock v. Williams,30 in which statutes of Georgia and Florida, not ma-
terially different from the one voided in Bailey, were held unconsti-
tutional. Although the Georgia statute prohibited the defendant from
testifying under oath, it did not prevent him from entering an unsworn
denial both of the contract and of the receipt of any cash advance-
ment thereunder, a factor that, the Court emphasized, was no more
controlling than the customary rule of evidence in Bailey. In the
Florida case, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant pleaded
guilty and accordingly obviated the necessity of applying the prima
facie presumption provision, the Court reached an identical result,
chiefly on the ground that the presumption provision, despite its
nonapplication, “had a coercive effect in producing the plea of guilty.”
    Pursuant to its section 2 enforcement powers, Congress en-
acted a statute by which it abolished peonage and prohibited any-
one from holding, arresting, or returning, or causing or aiding in
the arresting or returning, of a person to peonage.31
     The Court looked to the meaning of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment in interpreting two enforcement statutes, one prohibiting con-
spiracy to interfere with exercise or enjoyment of constitutional rights,32
the other prohibiting the holding of a person in a condition of invol-
untary servitude.33 For purposes of prosecution under these authori-
ties, the Court held, “the term ‘involuntary servitude’ necessarily
means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work
for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physi-
cal injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the
legal process.” 34

Situations in Which the Amendment Is Inapplicable
    The Thirteenth Amendment has been held inapplicable in a wide
range of situations. Thus, under a rubric of “services which have
from time immemorial been treated as exceptional,” the Court held
    29 315 U.S. 25 (1942).
    30 322 U.S. 4 (1944). Justice Reed, with Chief Justice Stone concurring, con-
tended in a dissenting opinion that a state is not prohibited by the Thirteenth Amend-
ment from “punishing the fraudulent procurement of an advance in wages.” Id. at

    31 Ch. 187, § 1, 14 Stat. 546, now in 42 U.S.C. § 1994 and 18 U.S.C. § 1581.

Upheld in Clyatt v. United States, 197 U.S. 207 (1905); see also United States v.
Gaskin, 320 U.S. 527 (1944). See also 18 U.S.C. § 1584, which is a merger of 3 Stat.
452 (1818), and 18 Stat. 251 (1874), dealing with involuntary servitude. Cf. United
States v. Shackney, 333 F.2d 475, 481–83 (2d Cir. 1964).
    32 18 U.S.C. § 241.
    33 18 U.S.C. § 1584.
    34 United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988). Compulsion of servitude through

“psychological coercion,” the Court ruled, is not prohibited by these statutes.
