as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of
the President.—The person having the greatest number of votes
as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number
be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if
no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers
on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quo-
rum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole num-
ber of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be
necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible
to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-
President of the United States.
                           ELECTION OF PRESIDENT
           This Amendment,1 which supersedes Article II, § 1, clause 3, was
       adopted so as to make impossible the situation that occurred after
       the election of 1800 in which Jefferson and Burr received tie votes
       in the electoral college, thus throwing the selection of a President
       into the House of Representatives, despite the fact that the elec-
       tors had intended Jefferson to be President and Burr to be Vice Presi-
       dent.2 The difference between the procedure that the Amendment
       defines and the original is in its providing for a separate designa-
       tion by the electors of their choices for President and Vice Presi-
       dent, respectively. As a consequence of the disputed election of 1870,
       Congress enacted a statute providing that if the vote of a state is
       not certified by the governor under seal, it shall not be counted un-
       less both Houses of Congress concur.3




            1 A number of provisions of the Amendment have been superseded by the Twen-

       tieth Amendment.
