                    ABOLITION OF THE POLL TAX


                   TWENTY-FOURTH AMENDMENT

    SECTIONS 1     AND    2. The right of citizens of the United States
to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice
President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Sena-
tor or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay
any poll tax or other tax.
    The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by ap-
propriate legislation.

        ercise of a citizen’s franchise” and expected its removal to “provide
        a more direct approach to participation by more of the people in
        their government.” Congress similarly thought that a constitu-
        tional amendment was necessary,2 because the qualifications had
        previously survived constitutional challenges on several grounds.3
            Not long after ratification of the Amendment—applicable only
