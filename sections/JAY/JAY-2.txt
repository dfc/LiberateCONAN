means of racial discrimination in state elections,4 and the Supreme
Court held that the poll tax discriminated on the basis of wealth in
violation of the Equal Protection Clause.5
    In Harman v. Forssenius,6 the Court struck down a Virginia stat-
ute that eliminated the poll tax as an absolute qualification for vot-
ing in federal elections and gave federal voters the choice either of
paying the tax or of filing a certificate of residence six months be-
fore the election. Viewing the latter requirement as imposing upon
voters in federal elections an onerous requirement that was not im-
posed on those who continued to pay the tax, the Court unani-
mously held the law to conflict with the new Amendment by penal-
izing those who chose to exercise a right guaranteed them by the
Amendment.
