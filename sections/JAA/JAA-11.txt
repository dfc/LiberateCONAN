to be ranked as fundamental,” 31 because certain proscriptions were
“implicit in the concept of ordered ‘liberty.’ ” 32
    As late as 1958, Justice Harlan asserted in an opinion of the
Court that a certain state practice fell afoul of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment because “[i]t is beyond debate that freedom to engage in asso-
ciation for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable
aspect of the ‘liberty’ assured by the Due Process Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech . . . .” 33
     But this process of “absorption” into due process, of rights that
happened also to be specifically named in the Bill of Rights, came
to be supplanted by a doctrine that had for a time co-existed with
it: the doctrine of “selective incorporation.” This doctrine holds that
the Due Process Clause incorporates the text of certain of the pro-
visions of the Bill of Rights. Thus, in Malloy v. Hogan,34 Justice
Brennan wrote: “We have held that the guarantees of the First Amend-
ment, the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures of the
Fourth Amendment, and the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment, are all to be enforced against the States under the Four-
teenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect
those personal rights against federal encroachment.” And Justice

    32  Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937). Justice Frankfurter was a strong
advocate of this approach to the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause. E.g.,
Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952); Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 59
(1947) (concurring opinion). Justice Harlan followed him in this regard. E.g., Benton
v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 801 (1969) (dissenting opinion); Williams v. Florida, 399
U.S. 78, 117 (1970) (concurring in part and dissenting in part). For early applica-
tions of the principles to void state practices, see Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86
(1923); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927);
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932); Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935);

14, 18 (1967), Chief Justice Warren for the Court said that the Court has “increas-
ingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a
state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law.” And, in Benton v. Mary-
land, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969), Justice Marshall for the Court wrote: “[W]e today
find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fun-
damental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States
through the Fourteenth Amendment.” In this process, the Court has substantially
increased the burden carried by those who would defend a departure from the re-
quirement of the Bill of Rights of showing that a procedure is fundamentally fair.
That is, previously the Court had asked whether a civilized system of criminal jus-
tice could be imagined that did not accord the particular procedural safeguard. E.g.,
Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937). The present approach is to ascertain
whether a particular guarantee is fundamental in the light of the system existent
in the United States; the use of this approach can make a substantial difference.
