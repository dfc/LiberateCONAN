but in Adamson v. California 22 a minority of four Justices adopted
it. Justice Black, joined by three others, contended that his re-
searches into the history of the Fourteenth Amendment left him in
no doubt “that the language of the first section of the Fourteenth
Amendment, taken as a whole, was thought by those responsible
for its submission to the people, and by those who opposed its sub-
mission, sufficiently explicit to guarantee that thereafter no state
could deprive its citizens of the privileges and protections of the Bill
of Rights.” 23 Scholarly research stimulated by Justice Black’s view
tended to discount the validity of much of the history recited by
him and to find in the debates in Congress and in the ratifying con-
ventions no support for his contention.24 Other scholars, going be-
yond the immediate debates, found in the pre- and post-Civil War
period a substantial body of abolitionist constitutional thought which
could be shown to have greatly influenced the principal architects,
and observed that all three formulations of § 1, privileges and im-
munities, due process, and equal protection, had long been in use
as shorthand descriptions for the principal provisions of the Bill of
Rights.25
    Unresolved perhaps in theory, the controversy in fact has been
mostly mooted through the “selective incorporation” of a majority
of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.26 This process seems to have

4 n.2 (1964). It must be said, however, that many of these Justices were not consis-
tent in asserting this view. Justice Goldberg probably should be added to the list.

     23 Id. at 74, Justice Black’s contentions, id. at 68–123, were concurred in by Jus-

tice Douglas. Justices Murphy and Rutledge also joined this view but went further.
“I agree that the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights should be carried over
intact into the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment. But I am not prepared to
say that the latter is entirely and necessarily limited by the Bill of Rights. Occa-
sions may arise where a proceeding falls so far short of conforming to fundamental
standards of procedure as to warrant constitutional condemnation in terms of a lack
of due process despite the absence of a specific provision in the Bill of Rights.” Id. at
124. Justice Black rejected this extension as an invocation of “natural law due pro-
cess.” For examples in which he and Justice Douglas split over the application of
nonspecified due process limitations, see, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479
(1965); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).

REV. 3 (1954); J. TENBROEK, EQUAL UNDER LAW (1965 enlarged ed.). The argument of
these scholars tends to support either a “selective incorporation” theory or a funda-
mental rights theory, but it emphasized the abolitionist stress on speech and press
as well as on jury trials as included in either construction.
     26 Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 130–32 (1970) (Justice Harlan concurring in

part and dissenting in part). The language of this process is somewhat abstruse.
Justice Frankfurter objected strongly to “incorporation” but accepted other terms.
“The cases say the First [Amendment] is ‘made applicable’ by the Fourteenth or that
