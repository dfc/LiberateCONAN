had its beginnings in an 1897 case in which the Court, without men-
tioning the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, held
that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause forbade the
taking of private property without just compensation.27 Then, in Twin-
ing v. New Jersey 28 the Court observed that “it is possible that some
of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments
against National action may also be safeguarded against state ac-
tion, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of
law . . . . If this is so, it is not because those rights are enumer-
ated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such
nature that they are included in the conception of due process of
law.” And, in Gitlow v. New York,29 the Court in dictum said: “For
present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech
and of the press—which are protected by the First Amendment from
abridgment by Congress—are among the fundamental personal rights
and ‘liberties’ protected by the due process clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment from impairment by the States.” After quoting
the language set out above from Twining v. New Jersey, the Court
in 1932 said that “a consideration of the nature of the right and a
review of the expressions of this and other courts, makes it clear
that the right to the aid of counsel is of this fundamental charac-
ter.” 30 The doctrine of this period was best formulated by Justice
Cardozo, who observed that the Due Process Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment might proscribe a certain state procedure, not
because the proscription was spelled out in one of the first eight
amendments, but because the procedure “offends some principle of
justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as


it is taken up into the Fourteenth by ‘absorption,’ but not that the Fourteenth ‘incor-
porates’ the First. This is not a quibble. The phrase ‘made applicable’ is a neutral
one. The concept of ‘absorption’ is a progressive one, i.e., over the course of time
something gets absorbed into something else. The sense of the word ‘incorporate’
implies simultaneity. One writes a document incorporating another by reference at
the time of the writing. The Court has used the first two forms of language, but
never the third.” Frankfurter, Memorandum on ‘Incorporation’ of the Bill of Rights
Into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 HARV. L. REV. 746, 747–48
(1965). It remains true that no opinion of the Court has used “incorporation” to de-
scribe what it is doing, cf. Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18 (1967); Benton v.
Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969), though it has regularly been used by dissent-
ers. E.g., Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 408 (1965) (Justice Harlan); Williams v.
Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 130 (1970) (Justice Harlan); Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. at
143 (Justice Stewart).
