     Taking judicial notice of the fact that ratification of the Twenty-
first Amendment was consummated on December 5, 1933, the Su-
preme Court held that the National Prohibition Act, insofar as it
rested upon a grant of authority to Congress by the Eighteenth Amend-
ment, thereupon become inoperative, with the result that prosecu-
tions for violations of the National Prohibition Act, including pro-
ceedings on appeal, pending on, or begun after, the date of repeal,
had to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Only final judgments
of conviction rendered while the National Prohibition Act was in
force remained unaffected.7 Likewise a heavy “special excise tax,”
insofar as it could be construed as part of the machinery for enforc-
ing the Eighteenth Amendment, was deemed to have become inap-
plicable automatically upon the Amendment’s repeal.8 However, li-
ability on a bond conditioned upon the return on the day of trial of
a vessel seized for illegal transportation of liquor was held not to
have been extinguished by repeal when the facts disclosed that the

      7 United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 222–26 (1934). See also Ellerbee v.

Aderhold, 5 F. Supp. 1022 (N.D. Ga. 1934); United States ex rel. Randall v. United
States Marshal, 143 F.2d 830 (2d Cir. 1944). Because the Twenty-first Amendment
contains “no saving clause as to prosecutions for offenses therefore committed,” these
holdings were rendered unavoidable by virtue of the well-established principle that
after “the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment
inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force. . . .” The General
Pinkney, 9 U.S. (5 Cr.) 281, 283 (1809), quoted in United States v. Chambers, 291
U.S. at 223.
      8 United States v. Constantine, 296 U.S. 287 (1935). The Court also took the

position that, even if the statute embodying this “tax” had not been “adopted to pe-
nalize violations of the Amendment,” but merely to obtain a penalty for violations of
state liquor laws, “it ceased to be enforceable at the date of repeal,” for with the
lapse of the unusual enforcement powers contained in the Eighteenth Amendment,
Congress could not, without infringing upon powers reserved to the states by the
Tenth Amendment, “impose cumulative penalties above and beyond those specified
by State law for infractions of . . . [a] State’s criminal code by its own citizens.”
Justice Cardozo, joined by Justices Brandeis and Stone, dissented on the ground
that, on its face, the statute levying this “tax” was “an appropriate instrument of
. . . fiscal policy. . . . Classification by Congress according to the nature of the call-
ing affected by a tax . . . does not cease to be permissible because the line of divi-
sion between callings to be favored and those to be reproved corresponds with a
division between innocence and criminality under the statutes of a state.” Id. at 294,
296, 297–98. In earlier cases, the Court nevertheless recognized that Congress also
may tax what it forbids and that the basic tax on distilled spirits remained valid
and enforceable during as well as after the life of the Amendment. See United States
v. Yuginovich, 256 U.S. 450, 462 (1921); United States v. Stafoff, 260 U.S. 477 (1923);
United States v. Rizzo, 297 U.S. 530 (1936).
