244. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge, 246 U.S. 357 (1918).
           Liberty of contract, as protected by the due process clause of the

      nonforfeiture statute, prescribing how net value of a life insurance policy
      is to be applied to avert a forfeiture in the event the annual premium
      is not paid, so as to prevent a Missouri resident from executing in the
      New York office of the insurer a different agreement sanctioned by New
      York law whereby the policy was pledged as security for a loan and
      later canceled in satisfaction of the indebtedness.
