3. Murray v. City of Charleston, 96 U.S. 432 (1878).
          A Charleston, South Carolina, tax ordinance which withheld from
      interest payments on municipal bonds a tax levied after issuance of
      such bonds at a fixed rate of interest impaired the obligation of con-
      tract (Art. I, ยง 10).

          A New Orleans ordinance, so far as it imposed license tax upon

      was an invalid regulation of commerce.

5. New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U.S. 650 (1885).
           A municipal ordinance granting to a public utility an exclusive right
      to supply the city with gas, and state constitutional provision abolish-
      ing outstanding monopolistic grants, impaired the obligation of con-
      tract when enforced against a previously chartered utility which, through
      consolidation, had inherited the monopolistic, exclusive privileges of
      two utility corporations chartered prior to the constitutional proviso
      and ordinance.

          When a utility is chartered with an exclusive privilege of supply-

      tract.

           A San Francisco ordinance regulating certain phases of the laun-
