26. Curran v. Arkansas, 56 U.S. (15 How.) 304 (1854).
          Retroactive Arkansas laws that vested all property of the state bank
      in Arkansas and thereby prevented the bank from honoring its out-
      standing bills payable on demand to the holders thereof impaired the
      bank’s contractual rights and were void.
              Justices concurring: Taney, C.J., McLean, Wayne, Grier, Curtis, Campbell
              Justices dissenting: Catron, Daniel, Nelson

27. State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 369 (1854).
           Because state banks, on acceptance of a charter under the Ohio
      banking law of 1845, were directed, in lieu of all taxes, to pay six per-
      cent of annual dividends to the states, a later statute that exposed
      these banks to higher taxes effected an invalid impairment of the obli-
      gation of contract.
              Justices concurring: Taney, C.J., McLean, Wayne, Nelson, Grier, Curtis
              Justices dissenting: Catron, Daniel, Campbell

28. Hays v. The Pacific Mail Steamship Co., 58 U.S. (17 How.) 596 (1855).
          California lacked jurisdiction to impose property taxes on vessels
      that were owned by a New York company and registered in New York,
      as the vessels’ calls at California ports were too brief to establish a
      tax situs.
              Justices concurring: Taney, C.J., McLean, Wayne, Catron, Nelson, Grier, Curtis,
                Campbell
              Justice dissenting: Daniel

29. Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 331 (1856).
           A levy under an 1851 Ohio law of a bank tax at a higher rate
      than that specified in the bank’s charter in 1845 was invalid because
      it impaired the obligation of contract.
              Justices concurring: Taney, C.J., McLean, Wayne, Nelson, Grier, Curtis
              Justices dissenting: Catron, Daniel, Campbell

30. Almy v. California, 65 U.S. (24 How.) 169 (1861).
           A California stamp tax imposed on bills of lading for gold or sil-
      ver transported from California to any place outside the state was void
      as a tax on exports forbidden by Art. I, § 10, cl. 2.

31. Howard v. Bugbee, 65 U.S. (24 How.) 461 (1861).

      erty in two years after sale under a foreclosure decree, by bona fide
      creditors of the mortgagor could not be applied to sales under mort-
