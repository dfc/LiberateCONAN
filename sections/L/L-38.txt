           North Dakota law compelling carriers to haul certain commodi-
      ties at less than compensatory rates deprived them of property with-
      out due process.

               McReynolds, White, C.J.

217. Norfolk & Western Ry. v. Conley, 236 U.S. 605 (1915).
          A West Virginia law that compelled carriers to haul passengers at
      noncompensatory rates deprived them of property without due process.

               McReynolds, White, C.J.
             Justice dissenting: Pitney

218. Wright v. Central of Georgia Ry., 236 U.S. 674 (1915).
           Since the lessee of two railroads, built under special charters con-
      taining irreparable contracts exempting the railway property from taxa-
      tion in excess of a given rate was to be viewed as in the same position
      as the owners, Georgia’s levy of an ad valorem tax on the lessee in
      excess of the charter rate impaired the obligation of contract (Art. I,
      § 10).
             Justices concurring: Holmes, McKenna, Day, Van Devanter, White, C.J.
             Justices dissenting: Hughes, Pitney, McReynolds

219. Davis v. Virginia, 236 U.S. 697 (1915).
           Solicitation by a peddler in Virginia of orders for portraits made
      in another State, with an option to the purchaser to select frames upon
      delivery of the portrait by the peddler, amounted to a single transac-
      tion in interstate commerce, and Virginia therefore could not validly
      impose a peddler’s license tax on the solicitor of such orders.

220. Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. v. Wisconsin R.R. Comm’n, 237 U.S. 220 (1915).
           Wisconsin statute requiring interstate trains to stop at villages of
      a specified number of inhabitants, without regard to the volume of busi-
      ness done there, was void as imposing an unreasonable burden on in-
      terstate commerce.
