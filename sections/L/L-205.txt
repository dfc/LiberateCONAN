      flicted with those required under the Federal Pure Food and Drug Act,
      imposed an invalid burden on interstate commerce.

      regulation pertaining to determination of an interstate railroadâ€™s liabil-
      ity for loss or damages to goods in transit, Texas law outlawing con-
      tractual stipulations specifying a period of limitations for filing of claims
      by a shipper which was briefer than that sanctioned by the federal
      law was unenforceable.
