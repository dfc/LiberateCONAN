46. Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 418 (1871).
          A Maryland law that exacted a traders’ license from nonresidents
      at a higher rate than was collected from residents violated the Privi-
      leges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, § 2.

47. Gibson v. Chouteau, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 92 (1872).
           State legislation cannot interfere with the disposition of the pub-
      lic domain by Congress, and therefore a Missouri statute of limita-
      tions, which was inapplicable to the United States, could not be ap-
      plied so as to accord title to an adverse possessor as against a grantee
      from the United States, notwithstanding that the adverse possession
      preceded the federal conveyance.
              Justices concurring: Field, Nelson, Swayne, Clifford, Miller, Bradley, Chase, C.J.
              Justices dissenting: Davis, Strong

48. Wilmington R.R. v. Reid, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 264 (1872).
          A North Carolina statute that levied a tax on the franchise and
      property of a railroad that had been accorded a tax exemption by the
      terms of its charter impaired the obligation of contract.

49. White v. Hart, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 646 (1872).
           The Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10) precluded reliance on a Geor-
      gia constitutional provision of 1868, prohibiting enforcement of any con-
      tract, the consideration for which was a slave, to defeat enforcement
      of a note based on such consideration and negotiated prior to adoption
      of said provision.
              Justices concurring: Swayne, Nelson, Davis, Strong, Clifford, Miller, Field, Bradley
              Justice dissenting: Chase, C.J.

50. Accord: Osborne v. Nicholson, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 654 (1872), invalidating
    a similar Arkansas constitutional provision adopted in 1868.
              Justices concurring: Swayne, Nelson, Davis, Strong, Clifford, Miller, Field, Bradley
              Justice dissenting: Chase, C.J.

51. Delmas v. Insurance Company, 81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 661 (1872).
          A Louisiana constitutional provision rendering unenforceable con-
      tracts, the consideration for which was Confederate money, was, be-
      cause of the Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10), inapplicable to contracts
      consummated before adoption of the former provision.

52. Case of the State Freight Tax, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873).
           A Pennsylvania law that imposed a tax on freight transported in-
      terstate, into and out of Pennsylvania, was an invalid regulation of
      interstate commerce.
