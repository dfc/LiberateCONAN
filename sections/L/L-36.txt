205. Carondelet Canal Co. v. Louisiana, 233 U.S. 362 (1914).
          Louisiana act of 1906 repealing prior act of 1858 and sequester-
      ing with compensation certain property acquired by a canal company
      under the repealed enactment impaired an obligation of contact.

           Texas act of 1914 stipulating that only those who have previously
      served two years as freight train conductors or brakemen shall be eli-

      a denial of the equal protection of the laws.

207. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 216 (1914).
           Kentucky criminal and antitrust provisions, both constitutional and
      statutory, were void for vagueness and hence violated due process be-
      cause a prohibition of combinations that establish prices that are greater
      or lower than the “real market value” of an article as established by
      “fair competition” and “under normal market conditions” afforded no
      standard that was possible to know in advance and to obey.
             Justices concurring: Holmes, Hughes, Lamar, Day, Lurton, Van Devanter,
               White, C.J.
             Justices dissenting: McKenna, Pitney
          Accord: International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 579 (1914);
      Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U.S. 634 (1914); American Machine Co. v. Ken-
      tucky, 236 U.S. 660 (1915).

208. Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Larabee, 234 U.S. 459 (1914).
           Kansas statute empowering a Kansas court to award against a
      litigant attorney’s fees attributable to the presentation before the United
      States Supreme Court of an appeal in a mandamus proceeding was
      inoperative consistently with the principle of national supremacy, for
      a state court cannot be empowered by state law to assess fees for ser-
      vices rendered in a federal court when such assessment is sanctioned
      neither by federal law nor by the rules of the Supreme Court.

209. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Brown, 234 U.S. 542 (1914).
           South Carolina law making mental anguish resulting from negli-
      gent non-delivery of a telegram a cause of action could not be invoked to
      support an action for negligent non-delivery in the District of Colum-
      bia, an area beyond the jurisdiction of South Carolina and, consistent with
      due process, removed from the scope of its legislative power. The stat-
      ute, as applied to messages sent from South Carolina to another juris-
      diction, also was an invalid regulation of interstate commerce.
