      tor carriers and local labor unions, which agreement stipulates that
      truck drivers owning and driving their own vehicles shall be paid the
      prescribed wages plus at least a prescribed minimum rental for the
      use of their vehicles. The state antitrust law, insofar as it is applied
      to prevent contracting parties from enforcing agreement upon a sub-
      ject matter as to which the National Labor Relations Act directs them
      to bargain, is invalid.

114. San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959).
          The failure of the NLRB to assume jurisdiction does not leave Cali-
      fornia free to apply its laws defining torts and regulating labor rela-
      tions for purposes of awarding damages to an employer for economic
      injuries resulting from the picketing of his plant by labor unions not
      selected by his employees as their bargaining agent. Since the em-
      ployer is engaged in interstate commerce, California laws cannot be
      applied to matters falling within the compass of the National Labor
      Relations Act.
             Justices concurring: Harlan, Clark, Whittaker, Stewart (separately)
