          A Georgia law that extended corporate limits of a town and that,
      as judicially construed, had the effect of rendering applicable to the
      added territory street railway rates fixed by an earlier contract be-
      tween the town and the railway impaired the obligation of that con-

      labor dispute, to submit the controversy to an arbitration board, and
      to abide by the latterâ€™s recommendations pertaining to the payment of

      of liberty without due process of law.
           Accord: Dorchy v. Kansas, 264 U.S. 286 (1924), same Kansas law
      voided when applied to labor disputes affecting coal mines; Wolff Pack-
      ing Co. v. Industrial Court, 262 U.S. 522 (1923), voiding other provi-

      served by an employer involved in a labor dispute.

      be recovered in a suit, to send, as a condition precedent to maintain-
      ing such action, its officer with corporate records pertinent to the mat-
      ter in controversy, and to submit to an adversary examination before
      answer, but which did not subject nonresident individuals to such ex-
      amination, except when served with notice and subpoena within Wis-
      consin, and then only in the court where the service was had, and which
      limited such examinations, in the case of residents of Wisconsin, indi-
      vidual or corporate, to the county of their residence violated the Equal
      Protection Clause.
