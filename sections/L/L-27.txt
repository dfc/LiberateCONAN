      fenses and constituted an invalid interference with admiralty jurisdic-
      tion exclusively vested in federal courts by Article III.

156. The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.S. 17 (1903).
           New York statutes giving a lien for repairs upon vessels, and pro-
      viding for the enforcement of such liens by proceedings in rem, were
      held void as in conflict with the exclusive admiralty and maritime ju-
      risdiction of the federal courts.
             Justices concurring: Brown, White, McKenna, Holmes, Day
             Justices dissenting: Brewer, Peckham, Harlan, Fuller, C.J.

157. Allen v. Pullman Company, 191 U.S. 171 (1903).
          A Tennessee tax of $500 per year per Pullman car, when applied
      to cars moving in interstate as well as intrastate commerce, imposed
      an invalid burden on interstate commerce.

158. Bradley v. Lightcap, 195 U.S. 1 (1904).
           An Illinois law, passed after a mortgage was executed, that pro-
      vided that, if a mortgagee did not obtain a deed within five years af-
      ter the period of redemption had lapsed, he lost the estate (whereas
      under the law existing when the mortgage was executed, failure by
      the mortgagee to take out a deed had no effect on the title of the mort-
      gagee against the mortgagor), was held void as impairing the obliga-
      tion of contract and depriving the mortgagee of property rights with-
      out due process.

159. Central of Georgia Ry. v. Murphey, 196 U.S. 194 (1905).

      porting on the shipment of freight to the shipper were held void when
      applied to interstate shipments.

160. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).
          A New York statute establishing a 10-hour day in bakeries vio-
      lated due process because it interfered with the employeesâ€™ freedom to
      contract in relation to their labor.
             Justices concurring: Peckham, Brewer, Brown, McKenna, Fuller
             Justices dissenting: Harlan, White, Day, Holmes (separately)

161. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U.S. 194 (1905).
          Because tangible personal property acquires a tax situs in the
      state where it is permanently located, an attempt by Kentucky, in
      which the owner was domiciled, to tax railway cars located in Indi-
      ana, was void and amounted to a deprivation of property without
      due process.
