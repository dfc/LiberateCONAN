      was enforced retroactively to accord a share to the successor in
      suits instituted by the retired agent before this legislative altera-
      tion.

339. New Brunswick v. United States, 276 U.S. 547 (1928).
           Property taxes assessed under New Jersey law on land acquired
      from the United States Housing Corporation by private purchasers sub-
      ject to retention of mortgage by the federal agency could not be col-
      lected by sale of the land unless the federal liens were excluded and
      preserved as prior liens.
             Justices concurring: Sanford, Stone, Sutherland, Butler, Brandeis, Holmes, Van
               Devanter, Taft, C.J.
             Justice dissenting: McReynolds

340. Brooke v. City of Norfolk, 277 U.S. 27 (1928).
           State and city taxes authorized under laws of Virginia may not be
      levied on the corpus of a trust located in Maryland, the income from
      which accrued to a beneficiary resident in Virginia; the corpus was be-
      yond the jurisdiction of Virginia and accordingly the assessments vio-
      lated due process.

341. Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32 (1928).
          A Kentucky law that conditioned the recording of mortgages not
      maturing within five years upon the payment of a tax of 20 cents
      for each $100 of value secured, but that exempted mortgages ma-
      turing within that period, was void as denying equal protection of
      the laws.
             Justices concurring: Sutherland, Butler, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Taft, C.J.
             Justices dissenting: Holmes, Brandeis, Sanford, Stone

342. Long v. Rockwood, 277 U.S. 142 (1928).
          A Massachusetts income tax law could not validly be imposed on
      income received by a citizen as royalties for the use of patents issued
      by the United States.
             Justices concurring: McReynolds, Butler, Van Devanter, Sanford, Taft, C.J.
             Justices dissenting: Holmes, Brandeis, Sutherland, Stone

343. Standard Pipe Line v. Highway Dist., 277 U.S. 160 (1928).
           An Arkansas law that purported to validate assessments by the
      district was ineffective to sustain an arbitrary assessment against the
      pipe line at the rate of $5,000 per mile in view of the fact that the
      pipe line originally was constructed in 1909â€“1915 at a cost under $9,000
      per mile, and the benefit, if any, that accrued to the pipe line was small.
