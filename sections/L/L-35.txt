199. Harrison v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R.R., 232 U.S. 318 (1914).
           An Oklahoma law that prohibited foreign corporations, upon pen-
      alty of forfeiting their license to do business in that state, from invok-
      ing the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction of federal courts, imposed
      an unconstitutional condition.

200. Foote v. Maryland, 232 U.S. 495 (1914).
          The Maryland oyster inspection tax of 1910, levied on oysters com-
      ing from other states, the proceeds from which were used partly for
      inspection and partly for other purposes, such as the policing of state
      waters, was void as imposing a burden on interstate commerce in ex-
      cess of the expenses absolutely necessary for inspection.

201. Farmers Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U.S. 516 (1914).
          Minnesota tax on bonds issued by a municipality of the Territory
      of Oklahoma and held by Minnesota corporations was void as a tax on
      a federal instrumentality (Art. VI).

202. Russell v. Sebastian, 233 U.S. 195 (1914).
          Amendment in 1911 of California constitution of 1879, and munici-
      pal ordinances of Los Angeles adopted in pursuance of the amend-
      ment were ineffectual by reason of the prohibition against impair-
      ment of contracts contained in Art. I, ยง 10, of the Federal Constitution,
      to deprive a utility of rights acquired before said amendment, which
      embraced the privilege of laying gas pipes under the streets of Los
      Angeles.

203. Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, 233 U.S. 304 (1914).
          Alabama sewing machine license tax could not be collected from
      those agencies of a foreign corporation engaged wholly in an inter-
      state business, that is, in soliciting orders for machines to be accepted
      and fulfilled at the Georgia office of the seller.

204. Tennessee Coal Co. v. George, 233 U.S. 354 (1914).
           Because venue is not part of a transitory cause of action, an Ala-
      bama law that created such a cause of action by making the employer
      liable to the employee for injuries attributable to defective machinery
      was inoperative insofar as it sought to withhold from such employee
      the right to sue on such action in courts of any state other than Ala-
      bama; the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Art. IV does not preclude a
      court in another state that acquired jurisdiction from enforcing such
      right of action.
