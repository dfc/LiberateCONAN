    III. STATE AND LOCAL LAWS HELD PREEMPTED BY
                     FEDERAL LAW
1. Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v. New Haven, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.)
    464 (1823).
           The property     of a charitable corporation chartered by the Crown,
      being specifically    protected by the treaty of peace of 1783, an act of
      Vermont adopted       in 1794 and purporting to convey such property to
      local subdivisions    was void.

2. Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).
          Because of conflict with the federal licensing act of 1793 authoriz-
      ing vessels to navigate coastal waters, a New York statute granting to
      certain persons an exclusive right to navigate New York waters was
      void.

3. Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832).
           A Georgia law that imposed penalties on white persons who, with-
      out first obtaining a license, established a residence within the limits
      of the Cherokee Nation, was unenforceable because of a conflict with
      treaties negotiated by the United States with such Indian tribes and
      because it extended to an area beyond the jurisdiction of the state.

4. Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842).
          A Pennsylvania statute (1826) that penalized an owner’s recovery

                McLean (separately)

5. Searight v. Stokes, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 151 (1845).
           Because, under federal acts ceding to Pennsylvania that part of
      the Cumberland Road within its limits, and Pennsylvania laws accept-
      ing the same, the carriage of mail over such road was to be free from
      toll, and later Pennsylvania law imposing tolls on coaches transport-
      ing passengers could not extend to the mail carried in such coaches.
              Justices concurring: Taney, C.J., Story, Wayne, Catron, McKinley, Nelson
              Justices dissenting: McLean, Daniel

6. Neil, Moore & Co. v. Ohio, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 720 (1845).
