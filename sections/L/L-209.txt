49. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Boegli, 251 U.S. 315 (1920).
           Federal legislation having preempted the field, Indiana law could
      no longer subject a telegraph company to a penalty for failure to de-
      liver promptly in Indiana a message sent from a point in Illinois.

50. Merchant’s Nat’l Bank v. Richmond, 256 U.S. 635 (1921).
          A Richmond, Virginia, ordinance and a Virginia statute that, as
      construed, levied a tax on state and national bank shares at the aggre-
      gate rate of $1.75 per $100 of valuation and upon intangibles at the
      aggregate rate of 85 per $100 valuation, a substantial proportion of
      which property was in the hands of individual taxpayers, were void as
      in conflict with federal law prohibiting discriminatory taxation of na-
      tional bank shares for the reason that the tax was imposed on the
      national bank stocks to the aggregate value of more than $8,000,000
      whereas the value of state bank stocks taxed was only $6,000,000.

51. First Nat’l Bank v. California, 262 U.S. 366 (1923).
           A California law that escheated to a state bank deposits un-
      claimed for 20 years, notwithstanding that no notice of residence has
      been filed with the bank by the depositor or any claimant, was invalid
      as applied to deposits in national banks because of conflict with fed-
      eral law.

52. Bunch v. Cole, 263 U.S. 250 (1923).
           When lease of an Indian allotment, made by the allottee in excess
      of the powers of alienation granted by federal law, is declared null and
      void by federal law, Oklahoma statute, as judicially applied, which gave
      the lease the effect of a tenancy at will and as controlling the amount
      of compensation which the allottee may recover for use and occupa-
      tion by the lessees also was void, consistently with the principle of na-
      tional supremacy.

53. Sperry Oil Co. v. Chisholm, 264 U.S. 488 (1924).
           An Oklahoma law that required that a lease on a family home-
      stead be executed by the wife as well as by the husband was inopera-
      tive, consistently with the principle of national supremacy, to the ex-
      tent that under federal law Congress had empowered a Cherokee Indian
      to make an oil or gas lease on his restricted “homestead” allotment
      subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
