      ized the railroads for their refusal to pay excessive claims, and accord-

193. Bucks Stove Co. v. Vickers, 226 U.S. 205 (1912).
           A Kansas law that imposed certain requirements, such as obtain-
      ing permission of the State Charter Board, paying filing and license
      fees, and submitting annual statements listing all stockholders, as a
      condition prerequisite to doing business in Kansas and suing in its courts
      could not constitutionally be applied to foreign corporations engaged
      in interstate commerce. A state cannot exact a franchise for the privi-
      lege of engaging in such commerce.

      lightning rods and other articles, as applied to representatives of a Mis-
      souri corporation soliciting orders for the sale and subsequent deliv-
      ery of stoves by said corporation, imposed an invalid burden on inter-
      state commerce.
           Accord: Rogers v. Arkansas, 227 U.S. 401 (1913).

           A Washington statute of 1907 repealing a prior act of 1893, with
      the result that rights to consequential damages for a change of street
      grade that had already accrued under the earlier act were destroyed,
      amounted to a deprivation of property without due process of law.

197. Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Tucker, 230 U.S. 340 (1913).
          A Kansas statute that did not permit a carrier to have the suffi-
      ciency of rates established under it determined by judicial review and
      that exposed the carrier, when sued for charging rates in excess thereof,
      to a liability for liquidated damages in the sum of $500, which was
      unrelated to actual damages, deprived carrier of property without due
      process of law.

           A South Dakota law that made railroads liable for double dam-
      ages in case of failure to pay a claim, within 60 days after notice, or
      to offer to pay a sum equal to what a jury found the claimant entitled
      to, was arbitrary and deprived the carriers of property without due
      process of law.
           Accord: Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. v. Kennedy, 232 U.S. 626 (1914).
