      and to impose as a penalty for its violation the forfeiture of valuable
      property, impaired the obligation of contract.

      an agent in Minnesota to solicit traffic over lines outside Minnesota
      may be served with summons by delivery of copy of it to the agent
      imposed an invalid burden on interstate commerce as applied to a car-
      rier that owned and operated no facilities in Minnesota and that was
      sued by a plaintiff who did not reside in Minnesota on a cause of ac-
      tion arising outside the state.
