320. Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Harding, 272 U.S. 494 (1926).
           When an Illinois tax law originally is construed as a personal prop-
      erty tax whereby the local net receipts of foreign insurance companies
      were subjected to assessment at only 30% of full value, but at a later
      date is construed as a privilege tax with the result that all the local
      net income of such foreign companies was taxed at the rate applicable
      to personal property while domestic companies continued to pay the
      tax on their personal property assessed at the reduced valuation, the
      resulting discrimination denied the foreign companies the equal pro-
      tection of the laws.
