      measured by the value of its capital, surplus, and individual earnings,

      the bank and was in conflict with a federal enactment exempting such
      bonds from state taxes.

           Consistent with doctrine of national supremacy and preemption,
      state laws, including one of the State of Washington, regulating hours
      of service embracing employees of interstate carriers, became inopera-

      Law notwithstanding that the latter did not go into effect until a year
      after its passage.

      flict with § 2 of the Hepburn Act of 1906 (34 Stat. 584), forbidding in-
      terstate railway carriers to make shipments until rates had been fixed
      and published by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which had not
      yet acted on this matter.
