33. New York Cent. R.R. v. Hudson County,227 U.S. 248 (1913).
          Congress having expressly included ferries used in connection with
      interstate railroads in its legislation regulating interstate commerce,
      two New Jersey municipal ordinances fixing passenger rates for travel
      on ferries between New Jersey and New York points were superseded
      and therefore invalid.

      of railroad telegraph operators engaged in interstate commerce was
      invalid.

      suant to Kentucky laws within four months prior to the filing of a pe-
      tition in bankruptcy under federal law, were null and void, and distri-

      by federal rather than by state law.

37. Southern Ry. v. Railroad Comm’n, 236 U.S. 439 (1915).
