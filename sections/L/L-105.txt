      area producers at a fixed price and to take all milk that these pro-
      ducers offered was invalid under the Commerce Clause because
      they interfered with distributor’s purchases of milk from out-of-state
      producers.

536. Anderson v. Martin, 375 U.S. 399 (1964).
           A Louisiana statute requiring that in all primary, general, or spe-
      cial elections, the nomination papers and ballots shall designate the
      race of the candidates violated the Equal Protection Clause.

537. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964).
          A Georgia statute establishing congressional districts of grossly un-
      equal populations violates Article I, § 2, of the Constitution.
              Justices concurring: Black, Douglas, Brennan, White, Goldberg, Warren, C.J.

538. Accord: Martin v. Bush, 376 U.S. 222 (1964). A Texas statute establish-
    ing congressional districts of grossly unequal populations is unconstitu-
    tional on authority of Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964). Same di-
    vision of Justices as in Wesberry v. Sanders.

539. City of New Orleans v. Barthe, 376 U.S. 189 (1964).

      ute requiring segregation of races in public facilities is affirmed.

540. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 (1964).
           An Illinois unfair competition law cannot be applied to bar or pe-
      nalize the copying of a product that does not qualify for a federal pat-
      ent, because this use of the state law conflicts with the exclusive power
      of the Federal Government to grant patents only to true inventions
      and then only for a limited time.

541. Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964).
           Washington statutes requiring state employees to swear that they
      are not subversive persons and requiring teachers to swear to pro-
      mote by precept and example respect for flag and institutions of United
      States and Washington, reverence for law and order, and undivided
      allegiance to Federal Government, are void for vagueness.
              Justices concurring: White, Black, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Goldberg,
                Warren, C.J.
              Justices dissenting: Clark, Harlan
