273. Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Everglades Drainage Dist., 258 U.S. 338
    (1922).
           A Florida law retroactively validating collection of fee for passage
      through a canal, the use of which was then free by law, was ineffec-
      tive; a legislature could not retroactively approve what it could not law-
      fully do.

274. Texas Co. v. Brown, 258 U.S. 466 (1922).
             A Georgia law levying inspection fees and providing for inspec-
      tion   of oil and gasoline was unconstitutional as applied to gasoline
      and    oil in interstate commerce; for the fees clearly exceeded the
      cost   of inspection and amounted to a tariff levied without the con-
      sent    of Congress.

275. Chicago & N.W. Ry. v. Nye Schneider Fowler Co., 260 U.S. 35 (1922).
          A Nebraska law, as construed, that authorized imposition against
      carrier, in favor of claimant, of an additional attorney’s fee of $100,
      upon the basis of the service rendered, time and labor bestowed, and
      recovery secured by claimant’s attorney in resisting appeal by which
      the carrier obtained a large reduction of an excessive judgment was
      unreasonable in that it deterred the carrier from vindicating its rights
      by appeal and therefore violated due process.

276. St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U.S. 346 (1922).
          An Arkansas law exacting of persons insuring property in Arkan-
      sas a five-percent tax on amounts paid on premiums to insurers not
      authorized to do business in Arkansas violated due process insofar as
      it was applied to insurance contracted and paid for outside Arkansas
      by a foreign corporation doing a local business.

277. Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, 260 U.S. 366 (1922).
           A Vermont levy of a property tax on logs under control of the owner
      which, in the course of their interstate journey, were being temporar-
      ily detained by a boom to await subsidence of high waters and for the
      sole purpose of saving them from loss, was void as a burden on inter-
      state commerce.

278. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922).
          A Pennsylvania law that forbade mining in such a way as to cause
      subsidence of any human habitation or public street or building and
      which thereby made commercially impracticable the removal of valu-
      able coal deposits was deemed arbitrary and amounted to a depriva-
      tion of property without due process. As applied to an owner of land
      who, prior to this enactment, had validly deeded the surface with ex-
