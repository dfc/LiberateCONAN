           A Georgia law that viewed a fatal collision between railroad and
      motor car at grade crossing as raising a presumption of negligence on
      the part of the railroad and as the proximate cause of death and that
      permitted the jury to weigh the presumption as evidence against the

      sisting of securities managed by a Maryland trustee who paid over to
      children of settlor, all of whom resided in Virginia, the income from
      the trust, violated due process because it taxed intangibles with a tax-
