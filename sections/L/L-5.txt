9. Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank v. Smith, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 131 (1821).
          A Pennsylvania insolvency law, insofar as it purported to dis-
      charge a debtor from obligations contracted prior to its passage, vio-
      lated the Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10).

10. Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1 (1823).
           Because the compact between Virginia and Kentucky negotiated
      on the occasion of the separation of the latter from the former stipu-
      lated that rights in lands within the ceded area should remain valid
      and secure under the laws of Kentucky, and should be determined by
      Virginia law as of the time of separation, a subsequent Kentucky law
      that diminished the rights of a lawful owner by reducing the scope of
      his remedies against an adverse possessor violated the Contracts Clause
      (Art. I, § 10).
              Justice concurring: Johnson (separately)

12. Ogden v. Saunders, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 213 (1827).
          Although a New York insolvency law may be applied to discharge
      a debt contracted subsequently to the passage of such law, the statute
      could not be accorded extraterritorial enforcement to the extent of dis-
      charging a claim sought to be collected by a citizen of another state
      either in a federal court or in the courts of other states.
              Justices concurring: Johnson, Marshall, C.J., Duvall, Story

          A Maryland statute that required an importer to obtain a license
      before reselling in the original package articles imported from abroad
      was in conflict with the federal power to regulate foreign commerce
      (Art. I, § 8, cl. 3) and with the constitutional provision (Art. I, § 10, cl.
      2) prohibiting states from levying import duties.
