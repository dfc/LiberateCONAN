          A Washington statute of 1905, as interpreted to authorize taxa-
      tion of Whitman College, impaired the obligation of contract by nulli-
      fying the College’s exemption from taxation conferred by its charter.

188. Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Cook Brewing Co., 223 U.S. 70 (1912).
           A Kentucky statute prohibiting common carriers from transport-
      ing intoxicating liquors to “dry” points in Kentucky was constitution-
      ally inapplicable to interstate shipments of such liquor to consignees
      in Kentucky.

189. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. O’Connor, 223 U.S. 280 (1912).
           A Colorado law levying tax of 2 cents on each $1,000 of a corpora-
      tion’s capital stock could not constitutionally be collected from a Kan-
      sas corporation engaged in interstate commerce, the greater part of
      whose property and business was located and conducted outside Colo-
      rado.

190. Oklahoma v. Wells, Fargo & Co., 223 U.S. 298 (1912).
           An Oklahoma law that purported to be an ad valorem tax on the
      property of corporations, levied in the form of a three-percent gross
      receipts tax, and computed, in the case of express companies doing an
      interstate business, as a percentage of gross receipts from all sources,
      interstate as well as intrastate, which is equal to the proportion that
      its business in Oklahoma bears to its total business, was void as ap-
      plied to such express companies. The tax burdened interstate com-
      merce and was levied, contrary to due process, on property in the form
      of income from investments and bonds located outside the state.

191. Haskell v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 224 U.S. 217 (1912).
          An Oklahoma conservation law, insofar as it withheld from for-
      eign corporations the right to lay pipe lines across highways for pur-
      poses of transporting natural gas in interstate commerce, imposed an
      invalid burden on interstate commerce.

192. St. Louis, I. Mt. & So. Ry. v. Wynne,224 U.S. 354 (1912).
          An Arkansas law compelling railroads to pay claimants within 30
      days after notice of injury to livestock caused by their trains, and, upon
      default thereof, authorizing claimants to recover double the damages
      awarded by a jury plus an attorney’s fee, notwithstanding that the amount
      sued for was less than the amount originally claimed, in effect penal-
