      held to discriminate against meat producers from other states and to
      place an undue burden upon interstate commerce.

124. Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U.S. 78 (1891).
          A Virginia statute prohibiting sale of meat killed 100 miles or more
      from place of sale, unless it was first inspected in Virginia, held void
      as interference with interstate commerce and imposing a discrimina-
      tory tax.

125. Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1 (1891).
          An Oregon act of 1887 that voided all certificates for the sale of
      public land unless 20% of the purchase price had been paid prior to
      1879, altered the terms of purchase provided under preexisting law
      and therefore impaired the obligations of the contract.

126. Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47 (1891).
          A Kentucky law that required a license from foreign express cor-
      poration agents before doing business in the state was held invalid
      under the Commerce Clause.
             Justices concurring: Bradley, Field, Harlan, Blatchford, Lamar, Brewer
             Justices dissenting: Fuller, C.J., Gray

127. Voight v. Wright, 141 U.S. 62 (1891).
            A Virginia statute that required state inspection of all but domes-
      tic flour held invalid under Commerce Clause.

128. Mobile & Ohio R.R. v. Tennessee, 153 U.S. 486 (1894).
          Tennessee statutes that levied taxes on a railroad company enjoy-
      ing tax exemption under an earlier charter impaired the obligation of
      contract.
             Justices concurring: Jackson, Field, Harlan, Brown, White
             Justices dissenting: Fuller, C.J., Gray, Brewer, Shiras

129. New York, L. E. & W. R.R. v. Pennsylvania, 153 U.S. 628 (1894).
           A Pennsylvania act of 1885 that required a New York corporation,
      when paying interest in New York City on its outstanding securities,
      to withhold a Pennsylvania tax levied on resident owners of such secu-
      rities, violated due process because of its application to property be-
      yond the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. The act also impaired the obli-
      gation of contracts by increasing the conditions originally exacted of
      the railroad in return for permission to construct and operate over track-
      age in Pennsylvania.
