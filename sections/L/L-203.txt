11. The Hine v. Trevor, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 555 (1867).
           Iowa statute providing an in rem remedy in state courts for mari-
      time causes of action was void by reason of conflict with § 9 of the
      Judiciary Act of 1789, which vested admiralty jurisdiction exclusively
      in the federal courts.

12. The Kansas Indians, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 737 (1867).
           When a treaty with Indian tribes exempted their lands from levy,
      sale, and forfeiture, Kansas could not validly collect its tax on lands
      held in severalty by members of such tribes under patents issued them
      pursuant to such treaty. Tribal Indians thus recognized by the Na-
      tional Government are exempt from the jurisdiction of the state.

13. The New York Indians, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 761 (1867).
          A New York statute imposing a tax on lands reserved to an In-
      dian tribe by treaty was void, notwithstanding provision therein that
      sale of land for nonpayment of the tax would not affect the right of
      occupancy by the Indians.

14. Bank v. Supervisors, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 26 (1868).
          New York tax could not be collected on United States notes ex-
      pressly exempted from state taxation by federal law authorizing their
      issuance as legal tender.

15. The Belfast, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 624 (1869).
          Inasmuch as a shipper’s lien under a contract of carriage between
      ports within the same State is a maritime lien enforceable by in rem
      proceedings exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction of federal court,
      an Alabama law creating a maritime lien enforceable by in rem pro-
      ceedings in its own courts was void.

16. Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S. 1 (1878).
           Florida legislative grant of a telegraphic monopoly held “inopera-
      tive” as in conflict with a congressional act dealing with the construc-
      tion of telegraph lines and based on its commerce and postal power.
              Justices concurring: Waite, C.J., Clifford, Strong, Bradley, Swayne, Miller
              Justices dissenting: Field, Hunt

17. Sprague v. Thompson, 118 U.S. 90 (1886).
          Georgia law requiring out-of-state coastal vessels, subject to cer-
      tain discriminating exemptions, to take on a pilot upon entering Geor-
      gia ports, was void by reason of conflict with federal pilotage law.
