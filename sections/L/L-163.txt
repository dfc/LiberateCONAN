897. Planned Parenthood of S.E. Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).
          One aspect of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982—a
      requirement for spousal notification—is invalid as an undue interfer-
      ence with a woman’s right to an abortion.

898. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761 (1993).
          A rule of the Florida Board of Accountancy banning “direct, in-
      person, uninvited solicitation” of business by certified public accoun-
      tants is inconsistent with the free speech guarantees of the First Amend-
      ment.
              Justices concurring: Kennedy, White, Blackmun, Stevens, Scalia, Souter, Thomas,

899. Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Envtl. Quality,511 U.S. 93
    (1994).
           Oregon’s imposition of a surcharge on in-state disposal of solid waste
      generated in other states—a tax three times greater than the fee charged
      for disposal of waste that was generated in Oregon—constitutes an in-
      valid burden on interstate commerce. The tax is facially discrimina-
      tory against interstate commerce, is not a valid compensatory tax, and
      is not justified by any other legitimate state interest.
              Justices concurring: Thomas, Stevens, O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg
              Justices dissenting: Rehnquist, C.J., Blackmun

900. Associated Industries v. Lohman, 511 U.S. 641 (1994).
          Missouri’s uniform, statewide use tax constitutes an invalid dis-
      crimination against interstate commerce in those counties in which the
      use tax is greater than the sales tax imposed as a local option, even
      though the overall statewide effect of the use tax places a lighter ag-
      gregate tax burden on interstate commerce than on intrastate com-
      merce.

901. Montana Dep’t of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767 (1994).
           Montana’s tax on the possession of illegal drugs, to be “collected
      only after any state or federal fines or forfeitures have been satisfied,”
      constitutes punishment, and violates the prohibition, derived from the
      Double Jeopardy Clause, against successive punishments for the same
      offense.
              Justices concurring: Stevens, Blackmun, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg
              Justices dissenting: Rehnquist, C.J., O’Connor, Scalia, Thomas
