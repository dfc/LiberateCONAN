213. County of Yakima v. Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. 251 (1992).
           The County of Yakima, Washington’s excise tax on sales of allot-
      ted Indian land does not constitute permissible “taxation of land” within
      the meaning of § 6 of the General Allotment Act, and is invalid.

214. Barker v. Kansas, 503 U.S. 594 (1992).
           A Kansas tax on military retirement benefits is inconsistent with
      4 U.S.C. § 111, which allows states to tax federal employees’ compen-
      sation if the tax does not discriminate “because of the source” of the
      compensation. No similar tax is applied to state and local government
      retirees, and there are no significant differences between the two classes
      of taxpayers that justify the different tax treatment.

215. Gade v. National Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88 (1992).
          Illinois’ “dual impact” laws designed to protect both employees and
      the general public by requiring training and licensing of hazardous waste
      equipment operators are preempted by § 18(b) of the Occupational Safety
      and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. § 667(b), which requires states to obtain fed-
      eral approval before enforcing occupational safety and health stan-
      dards relating to issues governed by federal standards.

216. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992).
           Two claims, based on New Jersey law and brought against ciga-
      rette companies for damages for lung cancer allegedly resulting from
      smoking, are preempted under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Ad-
      vertising Act: failure-to-warn claims requiring a showing that the to-
      bacco companies’ post-1969 advertising should have included addi-
      tional warnings, and fraudulent misrepresentation claims predicated
      on state law restrictions on advertising.

217. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993).
           Oklahoma may not impose income taxes or motor vehicle taxes
      on members of the Sac and Fox Nation who live in “Indian coun-
      try,” whether the land is within reservation boundaries, on allotted
      lands, or in dependent communities. Such tax jurisdiction is consid-
      ered to be preempted unless Congress has expressly provided to the
      contrary.

218. Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491 (1993).
          An Ohio statute setting priority of claims against insolvent insur-
      ance companies is preempted by the federal priority statute, 31 U.S.C.
      § 3713, which accords first priority to the United States, to the extent
      that the Ohio law protects the claims of creditors who are not policy-
      holders. Insofar as it protects the claims of policyholders, the law is
      saved from preemption by section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
