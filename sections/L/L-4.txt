4. Terrett v. Taylor, 13 U.S. (9 Cr.) 43 (1815).
          Although subsequently cited as a Contract Clause case (Piqua Branch
      Bank v. Knoop, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 369, 389 (1853)), the Court in the
      instant decision, without referring to the Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10),
      voided, as contrary to the principles of natural justice, two Virginia
      acts that purported to divest the Episcopal Church of title to property
      “acquired under the faith of previous laws.”

      gation contracted by him in 1811, while a resident of South Carolina,
      offended the Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10).

      nizes instrumentalities of the Federal Government from state taxa-
      tion, a Maryland law imposing a tax on notes issued by a branch of
      the Bank of United States was held unconstitutional.

           A New Hampshire law that altered a charter granted to a private
      eleemosynary corporation by the British Crown prior to the Revolu-
      tion violated the Contracts Clause (Art. I, § 10).
