517. St. Helena Parish School Bd. v. Hall, 368 U.S. 515 (1962).
           A Louisiana statute that authorized the school board of a munici-
      pally operated school system to close the schools upon a vote of the
      electors and that provided that the board might then lease or sell any
      school building, but that subjected to extensive state control and finan-
      cial aid the private schools that might acquire such buildings, vio-
      lated equal protection of the laws because it was intended to continue
      segregation in schools.

518. Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31 (1962).
           Mississippi statutes that required racial segregation at interstate
      and intrastate transportation facilities denied equal protection of the
      law.

519. Turner v. City of Memphis, 369 U.S. 350 (1962).
           A Tennessee statute, and an administrative regulation issued un-
      der it, insofar as they sanctioned racial segregation in a private restau-
      rant operated on premises leased from a city at its municipal airport,
      denied equal protection of the law.

520. Central R.R. v. Pennsylvania, 370 U.S. 607 (1962).
           Pennsylvania’s capital stock tax, in the nature of a property tax,

      3074) that represented the daily average of its cars located on a New
      Jersey railroad’s lines during a taxable year; as to the latter portion
      of its cars the tax violated the Commerce Clause and the Due Process
      Clause.
              Justice concurring: Black (separately)

521. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962).
           A California statute that, as construed, made the “status” of nar-
      cotics addiction a criminal offense, even though the accused had never
      used narcotics in California and had not been guilty of antisocial be-
      havior in California, was void as inflicting cruel and unjust punish-
      ment proscribed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
      ment.
              Justices concurring: Stewart, Warren, C.J., Brennan, Douglas (separately), Har-

              Justices dissenting: Clark, White

522. Lassiter v. United States, 371 U.S. 10 (1962).
           Louisiana laws that segregated passengers in terminal facilities
      of common carriers were unconstitutional because they conflicted with
      federal law and the Equal Protection Clause.
