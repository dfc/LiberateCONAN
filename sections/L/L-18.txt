      able in Confederate notes, the measure of recovery was to be the value
      of the land at the time of sale rather than the value of such notes at
      that time, impaired the obligation of contracts (Art. I, § 10).

96. Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens’ Gas Co., 115 U.S. 683 (1885).
           A Kentucky act of 1872 that chartered a corporation and autho-
      rized it to supply gas in Louisville, Kentucky, impaired the obligation
      of contract resulting from the grant of an exclusive privilege to an older
      company in 1869.

97. Fisk v. Jefferson Police Jury, 116 U.S. 131 (1885).
            When a public officer has completed services (1871–1874), for which
       the compensation was fixed by law, an implied obligation to pay him
       at such rate arises, and such contract was impaired by a Louisiana
       constitutional provision of 1880 that reduced the taxing power of a par-
       ish to such extent as to deprive the officer of any effective means of
       collecting the sum due him.

98. City of Mobile v. Watson, 116 U.S. 289 (1886).
            An Alabama law that deprived Mobile and its successor of the power
       to levy taxes sufficient to amortize previously issued bonds impaired
       the obligation of contracts.

99. Walling v. Michigan, 116 U.S. 446 (1886).
           A Michigan law taxing nonresidents soliciting sale of foreign li-
      quors to be shipped into the state imposed an invalid restraint on in-
      terstate commerce.

100. Royall v. Virginia, 116 U.S. 572 (1886).
           When a Virginia law provided that coupons on state bonds were
      acceptable in payment of state fees, a subsequent law requiring legal
      tender in payment of a professional license fee impaired the obliga-
      tion of contract between the coupon holder and the state. A law that
      imposed a penalty for practice without a license was void when ap-
      plied where the license had been denied for failure to pay in legal ten-
      der.

101. Pickard v. Pullman Southern Car Co., 117 U.S. 34 (1886).
           A Tennessee privilege tax on railway sleeping cars was void inso-
      far as it applied to cars moving in interstate commerce.

102. Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151 (1886).
          A state cannot validly sell for taxes lands that the United States
      owned at the time the taxes were levied, but in which it ceased to
      have an interest at the time of sale (Art. VI).
