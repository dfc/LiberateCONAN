      of 1% on the first $400,000 of gross sales, and that imposed increas-
      ing rates on each additional $100,000 of gross sales up to $1,000,000,
      with a maximum rate of 1% on sales over $1,000,000, was arbitrary
      and violated the Equal Protection Clause because there was no reason-

      lege of merchandising or between gross sales, the measure of the tax,
