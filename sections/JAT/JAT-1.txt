    SECTIONS 1 AND 2. The right of the citizens of the United States

                                WOMEN’S SUFFRAGE
            The Nineteenth Amendment was adopted after a long cam-
        paign by its advocates, who had largely despaired of attaining their
        goal through modification of individual state laws. Agitation in be-
        half of women’s suffrage was recorded as early as the Jackson Ad-
        ministration, but the initial results were meager. Beginning in 1838,
        Kentucky authorized women to vote in school elections and its ac-
        tion was later copied by a number of other states. Kansas in 1887
        granted women unlimited rights to vote in municipal elections. Not
        until 1869, however, when the Wyoming Territory accorded women
        suffrage rights on an equal basis with men and continued the prac-
        tice following admission to statehood, did these advocates register
        a notable victory. Progress continued to be discouraging, only ten
        additional states having joined Wyoming by 1914, and, judicial ef-
        forts having failed.1 A vigorous campaign brought congressional pas-
        sage of a proposed Amendment in 1919 and the necessary state rati-
        fications in 1920.2
            Following the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Fifteenth
        Amendment, the state courts that passed on the effect of the Amend-
        ment ruled that it did not confer upon women the right to vote,
        but only the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of
        their sex in the setting of voting qualifications,3 a formalistic dis-
        tinction to be sure, but one that has restrained the possible appli-
        cations of the Amendment. In only one case has the Supreme Court
        itself dealt with the Amendment’s effect, holding that a Georgia poll
