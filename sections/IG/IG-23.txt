the mails as an independent contractor 126 and an excise tax on gaso-
line sold to a contractor with the government and used to operate
machinery in the construction of levees on the Mississippi River.127
Although the decisions have not set an unwavering line,128 the Court
has hewed to a very restrictive doctrine of immunity. “[T]ax immu-
nity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on
the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely
connected to the government that the two cannot realistically be
viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being
taxed is concerned.” 129 Thus, New Mexico sustained a state gross
receipts tax and a use tax imposed upon contractors with the Fed-
eral Government which operated on “advanced funding,” drawing
on federal deposits so that only federal funds were expended by the
contractors to meet their obligations.130 Of course, Congress may
statutorily provide for immunity from taxation of federal contrac-
tors generally or in particular programs.131
    Taxation of Salaries of Federal Employees.—Of a piece with
James v. Dravo Contracting Co. was Graves v. New York ex rel.
O’Keefe,132 handed down two years later. Repudiating the theory “that
a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source,” the
Court held that a state could levy a nondiscriminatory income tax
upon the salary of an employee of a government corporation. In the
opinion of the Court, Justice Stone intimated that Congress could

     128 United States v. Allegheny County, 322 U.S. 174 (1944) (voiding property tax

that included in assessment the value of federal machinery held by private party);

applied to contractor purchasing article under agreement whereby he was to act as
agent for government and title to articles purchased passed directly from vendor to
United States).

v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505, 523 (1988).
     130 “[I]mmunity may not be conferred simply because the tax has an effect on

the United States, or even because the Federal Government shoulders the entire
economic burden of the levy.” United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720, 734 (1982).

Anderson Co., 342 U.S. 232, 234 (1952); United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720,
737 (1982). Roane-Anderson held that a section of the Atomic Energy Act barred the
collection of state sales and use taxes in connection with sales to private companies
of personal property used by them in fulfilling their contracts with the AEC. There-
after, Congress repealed the section for the express purpose of placing AEC contrac-
tors on the same footing as other federal contractors, and the Court upheld imposi-
tion of the taxes. United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964).
     132 306 U.S. 466 (1939), followed in State Comm’n v. Van Cott, 306 U.S. 511

(1939). This case was overruled by implication in Dobbins v. Erie County, 41 U.S.
(16 Pet.) 435 (1842), and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, 299 U.S. 401 (1937),
which held the income of federal employees to be immune from state taxation.
