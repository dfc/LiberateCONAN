    Deeming the second and third taxes similar to the first, the Court
sustained them as taxes on the privilege of using federal property
in the conduct of private business for profit. With reference to the
second, the Court emphasized that the government had reserved
no right of control over the contractor and, hence, the latter could

for the privilege of using property he possesses, and taxing him for
possessing property which he uses; for, in both instances, the use
was private profit. Moreover, the economic burden thrust upon the
government was viewed as even more remote than in the adminis-
tration of the first two taxes.151

sustain a tax imposed on the possessory interests of United States Forest Service
employees in housing located in national forests within the county and supplied to
the employees by the Forest Service as part of their compensation. A state or local
government may raise revenues on the basis of property owned by the United States
