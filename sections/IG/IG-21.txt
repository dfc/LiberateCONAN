Supervisors,109 over the objection that such notes circulate as money
and should be taxable in the same way as coin. But a state tax on
checks issued by the Treasurer of the United States for interest ac-
crued upon government bonds was sustained since it did not in any
way affect the credit of the National Government.110 Similarly, the
assessment for an ad valorem property tax of an open account for
money due under a federal contract,111 and the inclusion of the value
of United States bonds owed by a decedent, in measuring an inheri-
tance tax,112 were held valid, since neither tax would substantially
embarrass the power of the United States to secure credit.113 A state
property tax levied on mutual savings banks and federal savings
and loan associations and measured by the amount of their capital,
surplus, or reserve and undivided profits, but without deduction of
the value of their United States securities, was voided as a tax on
obligations of the Federal Government. Apart from the fact that the
ownership interest of depositors in such institutions was different
from that of corporate stockholders, the tax was imposed on the banks
which were solely liable for payment thereof.114
    Income from federal securities is also beyond the reach of the
state taxing power as the cases now stand.115 Nor can such a tax
be imposed indirectly upon the stockholders on such part of the cor-
porate dividends as corresponds to the part of the corporation’s in-
come which is not assessed, i.e., income from tax exempt bonds.116
A state may constitutionally levy an excise tax on corporations for
the privilege of doing business, and measure the tax by the prop-
erty of net income of the corporation, including tax exempt United
States securities or the income derived therefrom.117 The designa-
tion of a tax is not controlling.118 Where a so-called “license tax”
upon insurance companies, measured by gross income, including in-
terest on government bonds, was, in effect, a commutation tax lev-
