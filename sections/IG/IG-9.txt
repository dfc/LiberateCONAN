from other states or from foreign countries, he set up the Supreme
Court as the final arbiter in drawing the line between the mutu-
ally exclusive, reciprocally limiting fields of power occupied by the
national and state governments.28
    Until recently, it appeared that in fact and in theory the Court
had repudiated this doctrine,29 but, in National League of Cities v.
Usery,30 it revived part of this state police power limitation upon
the exercise of delegated federal power. However, the decision was
by a closely divided Court and subsequent interpretations closely
cabined the development and then overruled the case.
    Following the demise of the “doctrine of dual federalism” in the
1930s, the Court confronted the question whether Congress had the
power to regulate state conduct and activities to the same extent,
primarily under the Commerce Clause, as it did to regulate private
conduct and activities to the exclusion of state law.31 In United States
v. California,32 upholding the validity of the application of a fed-
eral safety law to a state-owned railroad being operated as a non-
profit entity, the Court, speaking through Justice Stone, denied the
existence of an implied limitation upon Congress’s plenary power
to regulate commerce when a state instrumentality was involved.
“The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been au-
thorized by Congress than can an individual.” 33 Although the state
in operating the railroad was acting as a sovereign and within the
powers reserved to the states, the Court said, its exercise was “in
subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which
has been granted specifically to the national government. The sov-
ereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent
of the grants of power to the Federal Government in the Constitu-
tion.” 34

struct any state immunity from regulation when Congress acted pur-
