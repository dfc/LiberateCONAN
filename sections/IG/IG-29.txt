constitutionally creates a corporation through which the federal gov-
ernment lawfully acts, the activities of such corporation are govern-
mental.” 161
    Similarly, the lease by a federal land bank of oil and gas in a
mineral estate, which it had reserved in land originally acquired
through foreclosure and thereafter had conveyed to a third party,
was held immune from a state personal property tax levied on the
lease and on the royalties accruing thereunder. The fact that at the
time of the conveyance and lease, the bank had recouped its entire
loss resulting from the foreclosure did not operate to convert the
mineral estate and lease into a non-governmental activity no lon-
ger entitled to exemption.162 However, in the absence of federal leg-
islation, a state law laying a percentage tax on the users of safety
deposit services, measured by the bank’s charges therefore, was held
valid as applied to national banks. The tax, being on the user, did
not, the Court held, impose an intrinsically unconstitutional bur-
den on a federal instrumentality.163
    Royalties.—In 1928, the Court went so far as to hold that a
state could not tax as income royalties for the use of a patent is-
sued by the United States.164 This proposition was soon overruled
in Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal,165 where a privilege tax based on gross
income and applicable to royalties from copyrights was upheld. Like-
wise a state may lay a franchise tax on corporations, measured by
the net income from all sources and applicable to income from copy-
right royalties.166
     Immunity of Lessees of Indian Lands.—Another line of anoma-
lous decisions conferring tax immunity upon lessees of restricted
Indian lands was overruled in 1949. The first of these cases, Choc-
taw & Gulf R.R. v. Harrison,167 held that a gross production tax on
oil, gas, and other minerals was an occupational tax, and, as ap-
plied to a lessee of restricted Indian lands, was an unconstitutional
burden on such lessee, who was deemed to be an instrumentality
of the United States. Next, the Court held the lease itself a federal
instrumentality immune from taxation.168 A modified gross produc-
tion tax imposed in lieu of all ad valorem taxes was invalidated in
