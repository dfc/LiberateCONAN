acquisition and transfer of property, their right to collect their debts,
and their liability to be sued for debts, are all based on State law.
It is only when the State law incapacitates the banks from discharg-
ing their duties to the government that it becomes unconstitu-
tional.” 88 In Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank,89 the Court stated the
second proposition thus: “National banks are instrumentalities of
the Federal government, created for a public purpose, and as such
necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States.
It follows that an attempt, by a State, to define their duties or con-
trol the conduct of their affairs is absolutely void, wherever such
attempted exercise of authority expressly conflicts with the laws of
the United States, and either frustrates the purpose of the na-
tional legislation or impairs the efficiency of these agencies of the
Federal government to discharge the duties, for the performance of
which they were created.” 90
     Similarly, a state law, insofar as it forbids national banks to
use the word “saving” or “savings” in their business and advertis-
ing, is void because it conflicts with the Federal Reserve Act’s au-
thorizing such banks to receive savings deposits.91 However, fed-
eral incorporation of a railroad company of itself does not operate
to exempt it from control by a state as to business consummated
wholly within the state.92 Also, Treasury Department regulations,
designed to implement the federal borrowing power (Art. I, § 8, cl.
2) by making United States Savings Bonds attractive to investors
and conferring exclusive title thereto upon a surviving joint owner,
override contrary state community property laws whereunder a one-
half interest in such property remains part of the estate of a dece-
dent co-owner.93 Similarly, the Patent Office’s having been granted
by Congress an unqualified authorization to license and regulate
the conduct throughout the United States of nonlawyers as patent
agents, a state, under the guise of prohibiting unauthorized prac-
tice of law, is preempted from enjoining such activities of a li-
censed agent as entail the rendering of legal opinions as to patent-
ability or infringement of patent rights and the preparation and
prosecution of application for patents.94
     The extent to which states may regulate contractors who fur-
nish goods or services to the Federal Government is not as clearly
established as is the states’ right to tax such dealers. In 1943, a
