had fled. The Court sustained both provisions, but upon the theory
that the cooperation of the state authorities was purely voluntary.
In Prigg, the Court, speaking by Justice Story, said that “while a
difference of opinion has existed, and may exist still on the point,
in different states, whether state magistrates are bound to act un-
der it, none is entertained by this Court, that state magistrates may,
if they choose, exercise that authority, unless prohibited by state
legislation.” 185 Subsequent cases confirmed the point that Con-
gress could authorize willing state officers to perform such federal
duties.186 Indeed, when Congress in the Selective Service Act of 1917
authorized enforcement to a great extent through state employees,
the Court rejected “as too wanting in merit to require further no-
tice” the contention that the Act was invalid because of this delega-
tion.187 State officials were frequently employed in the enforcement
of the National Prohibition Act, and suits to abate nuisances as de-
fined by the statute were authorized to be brought, in the name of
the United States, not only by federal officials, but also by “any pros-
ecuting attorney of any State or any subdivision thereof.” 188
     In Dennison, however, the Court held that, although Congress
could delegate, it could not require performance of an obligation.
The “duty” of state executives in the rendition of fugitives from jus-
tice was construed to be declaratory of a “moral duty.” Chief Jus-
tice Taney wrote for the Court: “The act does not provide any means
to compel the execution of this duty, nor inflict any punishment for
neglect or refusal on the part of the Executive of the State; nor is
there any clause or provision in the Constitution which arms the
Government of the United States with this power. Indeed, such a
power would place every State under the control and dominion of
the General Government, even in the administration of its internal
concerns and reserved rights. And we think it clear that the Fed-
eral Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose
on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to

How.) 66, 108 (1861). The word “magistrates” in this passage does not refer solely to
judicial officers but reflects the usage in that era in which officers generally were
denominated magistrates; the power thus upheld is not the related but separate is-
sue of the use of state courts to enforce federal law.
