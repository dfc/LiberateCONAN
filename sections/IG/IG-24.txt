not validly confer such an immunity upon federal employees. “The
burden, so far as it can be said to exist or to affect the government
in any indirect or incidental way, is one which the Constitution pre-
supposes; and hence it cannot rightly be deemed to be within an
implied restriction upon the taxing power of the national and state
governments which the Constitution has expressly granted to one
and has confirmed to the other. The immunity is not one to be im-
plied from the Constitution, because if allowed it would impose to
an inadmissible extent a restriction on the taxing power which the
Constitution has reserved to the state governments.” 133 Chief Jus-
tice Hughes concurred in the result without opinion. Justices But-
ler and McReynolds dissented and Justice Frankfurter wrote a con-
curring opinion in which he reserved judgment as to “whether Congress
may, by express legislation, relieve its functionaries from their civic
obligations to pay for the benefits of the State governments under
which they live.” 134
    That question is academic, Congress’s having consented to state
taxation of its employees’ compensation as long as the taxation “does
not discriminate against the . . . employee, because of the source
of the . . . compensation.” 135 This principle, the Court has held, “is
coextensive with the prohibition against discriminatory taxes em-
bodied in the modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental
tax immunity.” 136
    Ad Valorem Taxes Under the Doctrine.—Property owned by
a federally chartered corporation engaged in private business is sub-
ject to state and local ad valorem taxes. This was conceded in Mc-
Culloch v. Maryland 137 and confirmed a half century later with re-

    133  306 U.S. at 487.
    134  306 U.S. at 492.
     135 4 U.S.C. § 111. The statute, part of the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, was

considered and enacted contemporaneously with the alteration occurring in constitu-
tional law, exemplified by Graves. That is, in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405
(1938), the Court had overruled precedents and held that Congress could impose
nondiscriminatory taxes on the incomes of most state employees, and the 1939 Act
had as its primary purpose the imposition of federal income taxes on the salaries of
all state and local government employees. Feeling equity required it, Congress in-
cluded a provision authorizing nondiscriminatory state taxation of federal employ-
ees. Graves came down while the provision was pending in Congress. See Davis v.
Michigan Dep’t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 810–14 (1989). For application of the Act
to salaries of federal judges, see Jefferson County v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423 (1999) (up-
holding imposition of a local occupational tax).
     136 Davis v. Michigan Dept. of the Treasury, 489 U.S. at 813. This case struck

down, as violative of the provision, a state tax imposed on federal retirement ben-
efits but exempting state retirement benefits. See also Barker v. Kansas, 503 U.S.
594 (1992) (similarly voiding a state tax on federal military retirement benefits but
not reaching state and local government retirees).
