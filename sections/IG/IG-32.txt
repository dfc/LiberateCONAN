government,178 and Congress may frequently add others, provided
it does not require the state authorities to act outside their normal
jurisdiction. Early congressional legislation contains many illustra-
tions of such action by Congress.
     The Judiciary Act of 1789 179 not only left the state courts in
sole possession of a large part of the jurisdiction over controversies
between citizens of different states and in concurrent possession of
the rest, and by other sections state courts were authorized to en-
tertain proceedings by the United States itself to enforce penalties
and forfeitures under the revenue laws, examples of the principle
that federal law is law to be applied by the state courts, but also
any justice of the peace or other magistrates of any of the states
were authorized to cause any offender against the United States to
be arrested and imprisoned or bailed under the usual mode of pro-
cess. From the beginning, Congress enacted hundreds of statutes
that contained provisions authorizing state officers to enforce and
execute federal laws.180 Pursuant to the same idea of treating state
governmental organs as available to the national government for
administrative purposes, the act of 1793 entrusted the rendition of
fugitive slaves in part to national officials and in part to state offi-
cials and the rendition of fugitives from justice from one state to
another exclusively to the state executives.181
     With the rise of the doctrine of states’ rights and of the equal
sovereignty of the states with the National Government, the avail-
ability of the former as instruments of the latter in the execution
of its power came to be questioned.182 In Prigg v. Pennsylvania,183
decided in 1842, the constitutionality of the provision of the act of
1793 making it the duty of state magistrates to act in the return of
fugitive slaves was challenged; and in Kentucky v. Dennison,184 de-
cided on the eve of the Civil War, similar objection was leveled against
the provision of the same act which made it “the duty” of the chief
executive of a state to render up a fugitive from justice upon the
demand of the chief executive of the state from which the fugitive
