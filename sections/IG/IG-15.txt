tional League of Cities “will . . . in time again command the sup-
port of a majority of the Court.” 68 As the membership of the Court
changed, it appeared that the prediction was proving true.69 Con-
fronted with the opportunity in New York v. United States,70 to re-
examine Garcia, the Court instead distinguished it,71 striking down
a federal law on the basis that Congress could not “commandeer”
the legislative and administrative processes of state government to
compel the administration of federal programs.72 The line of analy-
sis pursued by the Court makes clear, however, what the result will
be when a Garcia kind of federal law is reviewed.
    That is, because the dispute involved the division of authority
between federal and state governments, Justice O’Connor wrote for
the Court in New York, one could inquire whether Congress acted
under a delegated power or one could ask whether Congress had
invaded a state province protected by the Tenth Amendment. But,
the Justice wrote, “the two inquiries are mirror images of each other.
If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth
Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power to
the States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereignty reserved
by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a power the Constitu-
tion has not conferred on Congress.” 73
    Powers delegated to the Nation, therefore, are subject to limita-
tions that reserve power to the states. This limitation is not found
in the text of the Tenth Amendment, which is, the Court stated,
“but a truism,” 74 but is a direct constraint on Article I powers when
an incident of state sovereignty is invaded.75 The “take title” provi-
sion was such an invasion. Both the Federal Government and the
    68  Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 579–80 (1985).
    69  The shift was pronounced in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991), in which
the Court, cognizant of the constraints of Garcia, chose to apply a “plain statement”
rule to construction of a statute seen to be intruding into the heart of state au-
tonomy. Id. at 463. To do otherwise, said Justice O’Connor, was to confront “a poten-
tial constitutional problem” under the Tenth Amendment and the Guarantee Clause
of Article IV, § 4. Id. at 463–64.
     70 505 U.S. 144 (1992).
     71 The line of cases exemplified by Garcia was said to concern the authority of

Congress to subject state governments to generally applicable laws, those covering
private concerns as well as the states, necessitating no revisiting of those cases. 505

     72 Struck down was a provision of law providing for the disposal of radioactive

wastes generated in the United States by government and industry. Placing various
responsibilities on the states, the provision sought to compel performance by requir-
ing that any state that failed to provide for the permanent disposal of wastes gener-
ated within its borders must take title to, take possession of, and assume liability
for the wastes, 505 U.S. at 161, obviously a considerable burden.
