very nature of their judicial duties, they would be called upon to
pronounce the law applicable to the case in judgment. They were
not to decide merely according to the laws or Constitution of the
State, but according to the laws and treaties of the United States—
‘the supreme law of the land.’ ” 18 State courts are bound then to
give effect to federal law when it is applicable and to disregard state
law when there is a conflict; federal law includes, of course, not only
the Constitution and laws and treaties but also the interpretations
of their meanings by the United States Supreme Court.19 Although
states may not have to specially create courts competent to hear
federal claims or give courts authority specially,20 it violates the Su-
premacy Clause for a state court to refuse to hear a category of
federal claims when the court entertains state law actions of a simi-
lar nature,21 or sometimes even when it does not entertain state
law actions of a similar nature.22 The existence of inferior federal
courts sitting in the states and exercising often concurrent jurisdic-
tion of subjects has created problems with regard to the degree to
which state courts are bound by their rulings. Though the Su-
preme Court has directed and encouraged the lower federal courts
to create a corpus of federal common law,23 it has not spoken to the
effect of such lower court rulings on state courts.
Supremacy Clause Versus the Tenth Amendment
    The logic of the Supremacy Clause would seem to require that
the powers of Congress be determined by the fair reading of the
express and implied grants contained in the Constitution itself, with-
      18 Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 335 (1816). State courts

have both the power and the duty to enforce obligations arising under federal law,
unless Congress gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction. Claflin v. Houseman,
93 U.S. 130 (1876); Second Employers’ Liability Cases, 223 U.S. 1 (1912); Testa v.
Katt, 330 U.S. 386 (1947).
      19 Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958). State judges must defer to the arbitration

process for resolving contract disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act even though
substantive state law applies. This is so despite allegations that arbitration of a par-
ticular subject violates state public policy, that Supreme Court precedents do not
control, or that a specific state law should trump a general federal statute. Nitro-
Lift Technologies, L.L.C. v. Howard, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–1377, slip op. (2012); Marmet
Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.S. ___, No. 11–391, slip op. (2012).
      20 In Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–10374, slip op. at 10 (2009), the

Court noted, “this case does not require us to decide whether Congress may compel
a State to offer a forum, otherwise unavailable under state law, to hear suits brought
pursuant to [a federal statute].”
      21 Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356 (1990); Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131 (1988).

The Court’s re-emphasis upon “dual federalism” has not altered this principle. See,
e.g., Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 905–10 (1997).
      22 See Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. ___, No. 07–10374, slip op. (2009), discussed

in Art. III, “Use of State Courts in Enforcement of Federal Law,” supra.

America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 (1957); Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U.S.
91 (1972).
