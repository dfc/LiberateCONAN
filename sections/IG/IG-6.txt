a federal program. Because Congress in pursuance of its para-
mount authority to provide for the national defense, as comple-
mented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, is competent to com-
pel testimony of persons that is needed in order to legislate, it is
competent to obtain such testimony over a witness’s self-
incrimination claim by immunizing him from prosecution on evi-
dence thus revealed not only in federal courts but in state courts
as well.12
     Priority of National Claims Over State Claims.—
Anticipating his argument in McCulloch v. Maryland,13 Chief Jus-
tice Marshall in 1805 upheld an act of 1792 asserting for the United
States a priority of its claims over those of the states against a debtor
in bankruptcy.14 The principle was later extended to federal enact-
ments providing that taxes due to the United States by an insol-
vent shall have priority in payment over taxes he owes to a state.15
Similarly, the Federal Government was held entitled to prevail over
a citizen enjoying a preference under state law as creditor of an
enemy alien bank in the process of liquidation by state authori-
ties.16 A federal law providing that when a veteran dies in a fed-
eral hospital without a will or heirs his personal property shall vest
in the United States as trustee for the General Post Fund was held
to operate automatically without prior agreement of the veteran with
the United States for such disposition and to take precedence over
a state claim founded on its escheat law.17

Obligation of State Courts Under the Supremacy Clause
    The Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States are
as much a part of the law of every state as its own local laws and
constitution. Their obligation “is imperative upon the state judges,
in their official and not merely in their private capacities. From the
     12 Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 434–436 (1956). See also Reina v.

United States, 364 U.S. 507, 510 (1960).

     15 Spokane County v. United States, 279 U.S. 80, 87 (1929). A state require-

ment that notice of a federal tax lien be filed in conformity with state law in a state
office in order to be accorded priority was held to be controlling only insofar as Con-
gress by law had made it so. Remedies for collection of federal taxes are indepen-
dent of legislative action of the states. United States v. Union Central Life Ins. Co.,
368 U.S. 291 (1961). See also United States v. Buffalo Savings Bank, 371 U.S. 228
(1963) (state may not avoid priority rules of a federal tax lien by providing that the
discharge of state tax liens are to be part of the expenses of a mortgage foreclosure
sale); United States v. Pioneer American Ins. Co., 374 U.S. 84 (1963) (Matter of fed-
eral law whether a lien created by state law has acquired sufficient substance and
has become so perfected as to defeat a later-arising or later-filed federal tax lien).
