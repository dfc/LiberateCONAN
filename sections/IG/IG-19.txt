closely divided Court sustained the refusal of the Pennsylvania Milk
Control Commission to renew the license of a milk dealer who, in
violation of state law, had sold milk to the United States for con-
sumption by troops at an army camp located on land belonging to
the state, at prices below the minimum established by the Commis-
sion.95 The majority was unable to find in congressional legislation,
or in the Constitution, unaided by congressional enactment, any im-
munity from such price fixing regulations. On the same day, a dif-
ferent majority held that California could not penalize a milk dealer
for selling milk to the War Department at less than the minimum
price fixed by state law where the sales and deliveries were made
in a territory which had been ceded to the Federal Government by
the state and were subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the for-
mer.96 On the other hand, by virtue of its conflict with standards
set forth in the Armed Services Procurement Act, 41 U.S.C. § 152,
for determining the letting of contracts to responsible bidders, a state
law licensing contractors cannot be enforced against one selected
by federal authorities for work on an Air Force base.97
     Most recently, the Court has done little to clarify the doctrinal
difficulties.98 The Court looked to a “functional” analysis of state
regulations, much like the rule covering state taxation. “A state regu-
lation is invalid only if it regulates the United States directly or
discriminates against the Federal Government or those with whom
it deals.” 99 In determining whether a regulation discriminates against
the Federal Government, “the entire regulatory system should be
analyzed.” 100

The Doctrine of Federal Exemption From State Taxation
    McCulloch v. Maryland.—Five years after the decision in Mc-
Culloch v. Maryland that a state may not tax an instrumentality
of the Federal Government, the Court was asked to and did reex-

    95  Penn Dairies v. Milk Control Comm’n, 318 U.S. 261 (1943).
    96  Pacific Coast Dairy v. Department of Agriculture, 318 U.S. 285 (1943). See
also Paul v. United States, 371 U.S. 245 (1963).
     97 Leslie Miller, Inc. v. Arkansas, 353 U.S. 187 (1956).
     98 North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423 (1990). The difficulty is that the

case was five-to-four, with a single Justice concurring with a plurality of four to reach
the result. Id. at 444. Presumably, the concurrence agreed with the rationale set
forth here, disagreeing only in other respects.
     99 495 U.S. at 435. Four dissenting Justices agreed with this principle, but they

also would invalidate a state law that “actually and substantially interferes with
specific federal programs.” Id. at 448, 451–52.
     100 495 U.S. at 435. That is, only when the overall effect, when balanced against

other regulations applicable to similarly situated persons who do not deal with the
government, imposes a discriminatory burden will they be invalidated. Justice Scalia,
concurring, was doubtful of this standard. Id. at 444.
