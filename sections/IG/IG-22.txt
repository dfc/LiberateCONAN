ied in lieu of other taxation upon the personal property of the tax-
payer, it was still held to amount to an unconstitutional tax on the
bonds themselves.119
     Taxation of Government Contractors.—In the course of his
opinion in Osborn v. Bank of the United States,120 Chief Justice Mar-
shall posed the question: “Can a contractor for supplying a military
post with provisions, be restrained from making purchases within
any state, or from transporting the provisions to the place at which
the troops were stationed? Or could he be fined or taxed for doing
so? We have not yet heard these questions answered in the affirma-
tive.” 121
     Today, the question insofar as taxation is concerned is an-
swered in the affirmative. Although the early cases looked toward
immunity,122 in James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,123 by a 5-to-4 vote,
the Court established the modern doctrine. Upholding a state tax
on the gross receipts of a contractor providing services to the Fed-
eral Government, the Court said that “ ‘[I]t is not necessary to cripple
[the state’s power to tax] by extending the constitutional exemp-
tion from taxation to those subjects which fall within the general
application of non-discriminatory laws, and where no direct burden
is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a
remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of gov-
ernment.’ ” 124 A state-imposed sales tax upon the purchase of goods
by a private firm having a cost-plus contract with the Federal Gov-
ernment was sustained, it not being critical to the tax’s validity that
it would be passed on to the government.125 Previously, it had sus-
tained a gross receipts tax levied in lieu of a property tax upon the
operator of an automobile stage line, who was engaged in carrying

      122 The dissent in James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134, 161 (1937),

observed that the Court was overruling “a century of precedents.” See, e.g., Pan-
handle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U.S. 218 (1928) (voiding a state privi-
lege tax on dealers in gasoline as applied to sales by a dealer to the Federal Govern-
ment for use by Coast Guard). It was in Panhandle that Justice Holmes uttered his
riposte to Chief Justice Marshall: “The power to tax is not the power to destroy while
this Court sits.” Id. at 223 (dissenting).

      124 302 U.S. at 150 (quoting Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U.S. 216, 225 (1931)).
      125 Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 (1941), overruling Panhandle Oil Co.

v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U.S. 218 (1928), and Graves v. Texas Co., 298 U.S.
393 (1936). See also Curry v. United States, 314 U.S. 14 (1941). “The Constitution
. . . does not forbid a tax whose legal incidence is upon a contractor doing business
with the United States, even though the economic burden of the tax, by contract or
otherwise, is ultimately borne by the United States.” United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S.
39, 44 (1964) (sustaining sales and use taxes on contractors using tangible personal
property to carry out government cost-plus contract).
