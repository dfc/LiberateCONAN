spect to railroads incorporated by Congress.138 Similarly, a property
tax may be levied against the lands under water that are owned by
a person holding a license under the Federal Water Power Act.139
However, when privately owned property erected by lessees on tax-
exempt state lands is taxed by a county at less than full value, and
houses erected by contractors on land leased from a federal Air Force
base are taxed at full value, the latter tax, solely because it discrimi-
nates against the United States and its lessees, is void.140 Like-
wise, when, under state laws, a school district does not tax private
lessees of state and municipal realty, whose leases are subject to
termination at the lessor’s option in the event of sale, but does levy
a tax, measured by the entire value of the realty, on lessees of United
States property used for private purposes and whose leases are ter-
minable at the option of the United States in an emergency or upon
sale, the discrimination voided the tax collected from the latter. “A
state tax may not discriminate against the government or those with
whom it deals” in the absence of significant differences justifying
levy of higher taxes on lessees of federal property.141 Land con-
veyed by the United States to a corporation for dry dock purposes
was subject to a general property tax, despite a reservation in the
conveyance of a right to free use of the dry dock and a provision
for forfeiture in case of the continued unfitness of the dry dock for
use or the use of land for other purposes.142 Also, where equitable
title has passed to the purchaser of land from the government, a
state may tax the equitable owner on the full value thereof, de-
spite retention of legal title; 143 but, in the case of reclamation en-
tries, the tax may not be collected until the equitable title passes.144
In the pioneer case of Van Brocklin v. Tennessee,145 the state was
denied the right to sell for taxes lands which the United States owned
at the time the taxes were levied, but in which it had ceased to
have any interest at the time of sale. Similarly, a state cannot as-

In Offutt Housing Co. v. Sarpy County, 351 U.S. 253 (1956), a housing company
was held liable for county personal property taxes on the ground that the govern-
ment had consented to state taxation of the company’s interest as lessee. Upon its
completion of housing accommodations at an Air Force Base, the company had leased
the houses and the furniture therein from the Federal Government.
