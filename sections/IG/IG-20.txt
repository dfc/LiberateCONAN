amine the entire question in Osborn v. Bank of the United States.101
In that case counsel for the State of Ohio, whose attempt to tax
the Bank was challenged, put forward two arguments of great im-
portance. In the first place it was “contended, that, admitting Con-
gress to possess the power, this exemption ought to have been ex-
pressly asserted in the act of incorporation; and not being expressed,
ought not to be implied by the Court.” 102 To which Marshall re-
plied: “It is no unusual thing for an act of Congress to imply, with-
out expressing, this very exemption from state control, which is said
to be so objectionable in this instance.” 103 Secondly, the appellants
relied “greatly on the distinction between the bank and the public
institutions, such as the mint or the post office. The agents in those
offices are, it is said, officers of government. . . . Not so the direc-
tors of the bank. The connection of the government with the bank,
is likened to that with contractors.” 104 Marshall accepted this anal-
ogy but not to the advantage of the appellants. He simply indi-
cated that all contractors who dealt with the government were en-
titled to immunity from taxation upon such transactions.105 Thus,
not only was the decision of McCulloch v. Maryland reaffirmed but
the foundation was laid for the vast expansion of the principle of
immunity that was to follow in the succeeding decades.
    Applicability of Doctrine to Federal Securities.—The first
significant extension of the doctrine of the immunity of federal in-
strumentalities from state taxation came in Weston v. Charles-
ton,106 where Chief Justice Marshall also found in the Supremacy
Clause a bar to state taxation of obligations of the United States.
During the Civil War, when Congress authorized the issuance of
legal tender notes, it explicitly declared that such notes, as well as
United States bonds and other securities, should be exempt from
state taxation.107 A modified version of this section remains on the
statute books today.108 The right of Congress to exempt legal ten-
der notes to the same extent as bonds was sustained in Bank v.

no little difficulty. American Bank & Trust Co. v. Dallas County, 463 U.S. 855 (1983);
