sent.155 Immediately after the Supreme Court construed the stat-
ute authorizing the states to tax national bank shares as allowing
a tax on the preferred shares of such a bank held by the Reconstruc-
tion Finance Corporation,156 Congress enacted a law exempting such
shares from taxation. The Court upheld this measure, saying: “When
Congress authorized the states to impose such taxation, it did no
more than gratuitously grant them political power which they there-
tofore lacked. Its sovereign power to revoke the grant remained un-
impaired, the grant of the privilege being only a declaration of leg-
islative policy changeable at will.” 157 In Pittman v. Home Owners’
Corp.,158 the Court sustained the power of Congress under the nec-
essary and proper clause to immunize the activities of the Corpora-
tion from state taxation; and in Federal Land Bank v. Bismarck
Lumber Co.,159 the like result was reached with respect to an at-
tempt by the state to impose a retail sales tax on a sale of lumber
and other building materials to the bank for use in repairing and
improving property that had been acquired by foreclosure or mort-
gages.
    The state’s principal argument proceeded thus: “Congress has
authority to extend immunity only to the governmental functions
of the federal land banks; the only governmental functions of the
land banks are those performed by acting as depositories and fiscal
agents for the Federal Government and providing a market for gov-
ernment bonds; all other functions of the land banks are private;
petitioner here was engaged in an activity incidental to its busi-
ness of lending money, an essentially private function; therefore § 26
cannot operate to strike down a sales tax upon purchases made in
furtherance of petitioner’s lending functions.” 160 The Court re-
jected this argument and invalidated the tax, writing: “The argu-
ment that the lending functions of the federal land banks are pro-
prietary rather than governmental misconceives the nature of the
Federal Government with respect to every function which it per-
forms. The federal government is one of delegated powers, and from
that it necessarily follows that any constitutional exercise of its del-
egated powers is governmental. It also follows that, when Congress
