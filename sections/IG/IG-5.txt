silent, however, the Court must itself decide whether the effect of
the federal legislation is to oust state jurisdiction.6

The Operation of the Supremacy Clause
     When Congress legislates pursuant to its delegated powers, con-
flicting state law and policy must yield.7 Although the preemptive
effect of federal legislation is best known in areas governed by the
Commerce Clause, the same effect is present, of course, whenever
Congress legislates pursuant to one of its enumerated powers. The
Supremacy Clause operates whether the authority of Congress is
express or implied, and whether plenary or dependent upon state
acceptance. The latter may be seen in a series of cases concerning
the validity of state legislation enacted to bring the states within
the various programs authorized by Congress pursuant to the So-
cial Security Act.8 State participation in the programs is voluntary,
technically speaking, and no state is compelled to enact legislation
comporting with the requirements of federal law. Once a state is
participating, however, any of its legislation that is contrary to fed-
eral requirements is void under the Supremacy Clause.9
    Federal Immunity Laws and State Courts.—The operation
of federal immunity acts 10 to preclude the use in state courts of
incriminating statements and testimony given by a witness before
a committee of Congress or a federal grand jury 11 illustrates direct
federal preemption that is not contingent on state participation in
     6 Treatment of preemption principles and standards is set out under the Com-

merce Clause, which is the greatest source of preemptive authority.
     7 Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 210–11 (1824). See also Cipollone v.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992); Morales v. TWA, 504 U.S. 374 (1992); Mary-
land v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981); Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S.
519, 525 (1977).
     8 By the Social Security Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq., Con-

gress established a series of programs operative in those states that joined the sys-
tem and enacted the requisite complying legislation. Although participation is volun-
tary, the underlying federal tax program induces state participation. See Steward
Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 585–98 (1937).
     9 On the operation of federal spending programs upon state laws, see South Da-

kota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) (under highway funding programs). On the preemp-
tive effect of federal spending laws, see Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood School
Dist., 469 U.S. 256 (1985). An early example of states being required to conform
their laws to the federal standards is King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968). Private
parties may compel state acquiescence in federal standards to which they have agreed
by participation in the programs through suits under a federal civil rights law (42
U.S.C. § 1983). Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980). The Court has imposed some
federalism constraints in this area by imposing a “clear statement” rule on Con-
gress when it seeks to impose new conditions on states. Pennhurst State School &
Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 11, 17–18 (1981).
     10 Immunity laws operate to compel witnesses to testify even over self-

incrimination claims by giving them an equivalent immunity from prosecution.
