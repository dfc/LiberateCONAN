suant to a delegated power.35 The culmination of this series had
been thought to be Maryland v. Wirtz,36 in which the Court upheld
the constitutionality of applying the federal wage and hour law to
nonprofessional employees of state-operated schools and hospitals.
In an opinion by Justice Harlan, the Court saw a clear connection
between working conditions in these institutions and interstate com-
merce. Labor conditions in schools and hospitals affect commerce;
strikes and work stoppages involving such employees interrupt and
burden the flow across state lines of goods purchased by state agen-
cies, and the wages paid have a substantial effect. The Commerce
Clause being thus applicable, the Justice wrote, Congress was not
constitutionally required to “yield to state sovereignty in the perfor-
mance of governmental functions. This argument simply is not ten-
able. There is no general doctrine implied in the Federal Constitu-
tion that the two governments, national and state, are each to exercise
its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full exercise of
the powers of the other. . . . [I]t is clear that the Federal Govern-
ment, when acting within a delegated power, may override counter-
vailing state interests whether these be described as ‘governmen-
tal’ or ‘proprietary’ in character. . . . [V]alid general regulations of
commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State
is involved. If a State is engaging in economic activities that are
validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by
private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activi-
ties to federal regulation.” 37
    Wirtz was specifically reaffirmed in Fry v. United States,38 in
which the Court upheld the constitutionality of presidentially im-
posed wage and salary controls, pursuant to congressional statute,
on all state governmental employees. In dissent, however, Justice
Rehnquist propounded a doctrine that was to obtain majority ap-
proval in League of Cities,39 in which he wrote for the Court: “[T]here

     36 392 U.S. 183 (1968). Justices Douglas and Stewart dissented. Id. at 201.

     38 421 U.S. 542 (1975).
     39 421 U.S. at 549. Essentially, the Justice was required to establish an affirma-

serts only the absence of congressional authority, one’s chances of success are dim
