for a long period, in their origin based on the United States Consti-
tution, the capacity of Congress to enforce statutory obligations through
judicial action was little doubted.194 Nonetheless, it was only re-
cently that the Court squarely overruled Dennison. “If it seemed
clear to the Court in 1861, facing the looming shadow of a Civil
War, that ‘the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no
power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and
compel him to perform it,’ . . . basic constitutional principles now
point as clearly the other way.” 195 That case is doubly important,
because the Court spoke not only to the Extradition Clause and the
federal statute directly enforcing it, but it also enforced a purely
statutory right on behalf of a Territory that could not claim for it-
self rights under the clause.196
    Even as the Court imposes new federalism limits upon Con-
gress’s powers to regulate the states as states, it has reaffirmed the
principle that Congress may authorize the federal courts to compel
state officials to comply with federal law, statutory as well as con-
stitutional. “[T]he Supremacy Clause makes federal law para-
mount over the contrary positions of state officials; the power of fed-
eral courts to enforce federal law thus presupposes some authority
to order state officials to comply.” 197
    No doubt, there is tension between the exercise of Congress’s
power to impose duties on state officials 198 and the developing doc-
trine under which the Court holds that Congress may not “comman-
deer” state legislative or administrative processes in the enforce-
ment of federal programs.199 However, the existence of the Supremacy

Clause rather than under the Extradition Clause. New York ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham,
