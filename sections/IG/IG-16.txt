states owe political accountability to the people. When Congress en-
courages states to adopt and administer a federally prescribed pro-
gram, both governments maintain their accountability for their de-
cisions. When Congress compels the states to act, state officials will
bear the brunt of accountability that properly belongs at the na-
tional level.76 The “take title” provision, because it presented the
states with “an unavoidable command”, transformed state govern-
ments into “regional offices” or “administrative agencies” of the Fed-
eral Government, impermissibly undermined the accountability ow-
ing the people and was void.77 Whether viewed as lying outside
Congress’s enumerated powers or as infringing the core of state sov-
ereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment, “the provision is incon-
sistent with the federal structure of our Government established
by the Constitution.” 78
     Federal laws of general applicability, therefore, are surely sub-
ject to examination under the New York test rather than under the
Garcia structural standard.
     Expanding upon its anti-commandeering rule, the Court in Printz
v. United States 79 established “categorically” the rule that “[t]he Fed-
eral Government may not compel the States to enact or administer
a federal regulatory program.” 80 At issue in Printz was a provision
of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that required, pend-
ing the development by the Attorney General of a national system
by which criminal background checks on prospective firearms pur-
chasers could be conducted, the chief law enforcement officers of state
and local governments to conduct background checks to ascertain
whether applicants were ineligible to purchase handguns. Confront-
ing the absence of any textual basis for a “categorical” rule, the Court
looked to history, which in its view demonstrated a paucity of con-
gressional efforts to impose affirmative duties upon the states.81 More
important, the Court relied on the “structural Constitution” to dem-
onstrate that the Constitution of 1787 had not taken from the states
“a residuary and inviolable sovereignty,” 82 that it had, in fact and
theory, retained a system of “dual sovereignty” 83 reflected in many
things but most notably in the constitutional conferral “upon Con-
