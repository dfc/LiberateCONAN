two per curiam decisions.169 In Gillespie v. Oklahoma,170 a tax upon
net income of the lessee derived from sales of his share of oil pro-
duced from restricted lands also was condemned. Finally a petro-
leum excise tax upon every barrel of oil produced in the state was
held inapplicable to oil produced on restricted Indian lands.171 In
harmony with the trend to restricting immunity implied from the
Constitution to activities of the government itself, the Court over-
ruled all these decisions in Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Texas Co. and
held that a lessee of mineral rights in restricted Indian lands was
subject to nondiscriminatory gross production and excise taxes, so
long as Congress did not affirmatively grant him immunity.172

Summation and Evaluation
    Although McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden were
expressions of a single thesis, the supremacy of the national govern-
ment, their development after Marshall’s death has been sharply
divergent. During the period when Gibbons v. Ogden was eclipsed
by the theory of dual federalism, the doctrine of McCulloch v. Mary-
land was not merely followed but greatly extended as a restraint
on state interference with federal instrumentalities. Conversely, the
Court’s recent return to Marshall’s conception of the powers of Con-
gress has coincided with a retreat from the more extreme positions
taken in reliance upon McCulloch v. Maryland. Today, the applica-
tion of the Supremacy Clause is becoming, to an ever increasing
degree, a matter of statutory interpretation; a determination whether
state regulations can be reconciled with the language and policy of
federal enactments. In the field of taxation, the Court has all but
wiped out the private immunities previously implied from the Con-
stitution without explicit legislative command. Broadly speaking, the
immunity which remains is limited to activities of the government
itself, and to that which is explicitly created by statute, e.g., that
granted to federal securities and to fiscal institutions chartered by
Congress. But the term “activities” will be broadly construed.

U.S. 549 (1919).

     171 Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Corp., 296 U.S. 521 (1936).
     172 336 U.S. 342 (1949). Justice Rutledge, speaking for the Court, sketched the

history of the immunity lessees of Indian lands from state taxation, which he found
to stem from early rulings that tribal lands are themselves immune. The Kansas
Indians, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 737 (1867); The New York Indians, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 761
(1867). One of the first steps taken to curtail the scope of the immunity was Shaw
v. Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 (1928), which held that lands outside a reservation, though
purchased with restricted Indian funds, were subject to state taxation. Congress soon
upset the decision, however, and its act was sustained in Board of County Comm’rs
v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705 (1943).
