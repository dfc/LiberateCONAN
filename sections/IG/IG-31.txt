    Clause 3. The Senators and Representatives before men-
tioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and
all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and
of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to
support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be re-
quired as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the
United States.

                                       OATH OF OFFICE

        Power of Congress in Respect to Oaths
            Congress may require no other oath of fidelity to the Constitu-
        tion, but it may add to this oath such other oath of office as its
        wisdom may require.173 It may not, however, prescribe a test oath
        as a qualification for holding office, such an act being in effect an
        ex post facto law,174 and the same rule holds in the case of the states.175

        National Duties of State Officers
             Commenting in The Federalist on the requirement that state
        officers, as well as members of the state legislatures, shall be bound
        by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution, Hamilton wrote:
        “Thus the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the respective mem-
        bers, will be incorporated into the operations of the national govern-
        ment as far as its just and constitutional authority extends; and it
        will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws.” 176 The
        younger Pinckney had expressed the same idea on the floor of the
        Philadelphia Convention: “They [the states] are the instruments upon
        which the Union must frequently depend for the support and execu-
        tion of their powers. . . .” 177 Indeed, the Constitution itself lays many
        duties, both positive and negative, upon the different organs of state

        ments made by a newly elected member of the Georgia House of Representatives
        were not inconsistent with the oath of office to support to the United States Consti-
        tution.
