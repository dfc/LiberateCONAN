permitted Congress to intrude into the conduct of integral and tra-
ditional state governmental functions and could not therefore stand.46
     League of Cities did not prove to be much of a restriction upon
congressional power in subsequent decisions. First, its principle was
held not to reach to state regulation of private conduct that affects
interstate commerce, even as to such matters as state jurisdiction
over land within its borders.47 Second, it was held not to immunize
state conduct of a business operation, that is, proprietary activity
not like “traditional governmental activities.” 48 Third, it was held
not to preclude Congress from regulating the way states regulate
private activities within the state—even though such state activity
is certainly traditional governmental action—on the theory that, be-
cause Congress could displace or preempt state regulation, it may
require the states to regulate in a certain way if they wish to con-
tinue to act in this field.49 Fourth, it was held not to limit Con-
gress when it acts in an emergency or pursuant to its war powers,
so that Congress may indeed reach even traditional governmental
activity.50 Fifth, it was held not to apply at all to Congress’s enforce-
ment powers under the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amend-
ments.51 Sixth, it apparently was to have no application to the ex-
ercise of Congress’s spending power with conditions attached.52
Seventh, not because of the way the Court framed the statement of
its doctrinal position, which is absolutist, but because of the way it
accommodated precedent and because of Justice Blackmun’s concur-
rence, it was always open to interpretation that Congress was en-
abled to reach traditional governmental activities not involving
employer-employee relations or is enabled to reach even these rela-
tions if the effect is “to reduce the pressures upon state budgets

the Court suggested rather ambiguously that League of Cities may restrict the fed-
eral spending power, citing its reservation of the cases in League of Cities, 426 U.S.
852 n.17, but citing also spending clause cases indicating a rational basis standard
of review of conditioned spending. Earlier, the Court had summarily affirmed a deci-
sion holding that the spending power was not affected by the case. North Carolina
