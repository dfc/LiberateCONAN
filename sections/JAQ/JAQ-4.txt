ton v. Brady,9 the Court held the following taxes to have been lev-
ied merely upon one of the “incidents of ownership” and hence to
be excises: a tax that involved affixing revenue stamps to memo-
randa evidencing the sale of merchandise on commodity exchanges,
an inheritance tax, and a war revenue tax upon tobacco on which
the hitherto imposed excise tax had already been paid and that was
held by the manufacturer for resale.
    Under this approach, the Court found it possible to sustain a
corporate income tax as an excise “measured by income” on the privi-
lege of doing business in corporate form.10 The adoption of the Six-
teenth Amendment, however, put an end to speculation whether the
Court, unaided by constitutional amendment, would persist along
these lines of construction until it had reversed its holding in Pol-
lock. Indeed, in its initial appraisal 11 of the Amendment, it classi-
fied income taxes as being inherently “indirect.” “[T]he command of
the Amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to appor-
tionment by a consideration of the sources from which the taxed
income may be derived, forbids the application to such taxes of the
rule applied in the Pollock Case by which alone such taxes were
removed from the great class of excises, duties and imports subject
to the rule of uniformity and were placed under the other or direct
class.” 12 “[T]he Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of
taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary
power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the begin-
ning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to
which it inherently belonged . . . .” 13

Income Subject to Taxation
    Building upon definitions formulated in cases construing the Cor-
poration Tax Act of 1909,14 the Court initially described income as
the “gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,”
inclusive of the “profit gained through a sale or conversion of capi-
tal assets”; 15 in the following array of factual situations it subse-
quently applied this definition to achieve results that have been pro-
ductive of extended controversy.
