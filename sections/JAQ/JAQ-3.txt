                                INCOME TAX


                      SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT
    The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on
incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment
among the several States, and without regard to any census or
enumeration.
                                        INCOME TAX

       History and Purpose of the Amendment
           The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment was the direct con-
       sequence of the Court’s 1895 decision in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan
       & Trust Co.1 holding unconstitutional Congress’s attempt of the pre-
       vious year to tax incomes uniformly throughout the United States.2
       A tax on incomes derived from property,3 the Court declared, was a
       “direct tax,” which Congress, under the terms of Article I, § 2, and
       § 9, could impose only by the rule of apportionment according to
       population. Scarcely fifteen years earlier the Justices had unani-
       mously sustained 4 the collection of a similar tax during the Civil
       War,5 the only other occasion preceding the Sixteenth Amendment
       in which Congress had used this method of raising revenue.6
           During the years between the Pollock decision in 1895 and the
       ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, the Court gave
       evidence of a greater awareness of the dangerous consequences to
       national solvency that Pollock threatened, and partially circum-
       vented the threat, either by taking refuge in redefinitions of “direct
       tax” or by emphasizing the history of excise taxation. Thus, in a
       series of cases, notably Nicol v. Ames,7 Knowlton v. Moore,8 and Pat-
           1 157 U.S. 429 (1895); 158 U.S. 601 (1895).
           2 Ch. 349, § 27, 28 Stat. 509, 553.
           3 The Court conceded that taxes on incomes from “professions, trades, employ-

       ments, or vocations” levied by this act were excise taxes and therefore valid. The
       entire statute, however, was voided on the ground that Congress never intended to
       permit the entire “burden of the tax to be borne by professions, trades, employ-
       ments, or vocations” after real estate and personal property had been exempted, 158
       U.S. at 635.

           5 Ch. 173, § 116, 13 Stat. 223, 281 (1864).
