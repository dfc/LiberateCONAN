    Also, a taxpayer who erected a $3,000,000 office building on land,
the unimproved worth of which was $660,000, and who subse-
quently purchased the lease on the latter for $2,100,000 is entitled
to compute depreciation over the remaining useful life of the build-
ing on that portion of $1,440,000, representing the difference be-
tween the price and the unimproved value, as may be allocated to
the building; but he cannot deduct the $1,440,000 as a business ex-
pense incurred in eliminating the cost of allegedly excessive rent-
als under the lease, nor can he treat that sum as a prepayment of
rent to be amortized over the 21-year period that the lease was to
run.54
    Diminution of Loss.—Mere diminution of loss is neither gain,
profit, nor income. Accordingly, one who in 1913 borrowed a sum of
money to be repaid in German marks and who subsequently lost
the money in a business transaction cannot be taxed on the curtail-
ment of debt effected by using depreciated marks in 1921 to settle
a liability of $798,144 for $113,688, the “saving” having been ex-
ceeded by a loss on the entire operation.55




merely represents a return of expenditures made in performing the contract and
resulting in a loss. The gain or profit subject to tax under the Sixteenth Amend-
ment is the excess of receipts over allowable deductions during the accounting pe-
riod, without regard to whether or not such excess represents a profit ascertained
on the basis of particular transactions of the taxpayer when they are brought to a
conclusion. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U.S. 359 (1931).
     The grant on denial of deductions is not based on the taxpayers’ engagement in
constitutionally protected activities, and, accordingly, no deduction is granted for sums
expended in combating legislation, enactment of which would destroy taxpayer’s busi-
ness. Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498 (1959).
     Likewise, when tank truck owners, either intentionally for business reasons or
unintentionally, violate state maximum weight laws, and incur fines, the latter are
not deductible, for fines are penalties rather than tolls for the use of highways, and
Congress is not to be viewed as having intended to encourage enterprises to violate
state policy. Tank Truck Rentals v. Commissioner, 356 U.S. 30 (1958); Hoover Ex-
press Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 38 (1958).
     54 Millinery Corp. v. Commissioner, 350 U.S. 456 (1956).
     55 Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U.S. 170 (1926).
