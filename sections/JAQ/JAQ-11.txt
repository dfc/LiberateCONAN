     Income from Illicit Transactions.—In United States v. Sulli-
van,44 the Court held that gains derived from illicit traffic were tax-
able income under the act of 1921.45 Justice Holmes wrote, for the
unanimous Court: “We see no reason . . . why the fact that a busi-
ness is unlawful should exempt it from paying the taxes that if law-
ful it would have to pay.” 46 Consistent with that decision, although
not without dissent, the Court ruled that Congress has the power
to tax as income moneys received by an extortioner,47 and, more
recently, that embezzled money is taxable income of an embezzler
in the year of embezzlement. “When a taxpayer acquires earnings,

gain to the person whose income is under consideration became such subsequent to
the date at which the amendment went into effect, namely, March 1, 1913, and is a
real, and not merely an apparent, gain, said gain is taxable. Thus, one who pur-
chased stock in 1912 for $500 could not limit his taxable gain to the difference, $695,
the value of the stock on March 1, 1913 and $13,931, the price obtained on the sale
thereof, in 1916; but was obliged to pay tax on the entire gain, that is the difference
between the original purchase price and the proceeds of the sale, Goodrich v. Ed-
wards, 255 U.S. 527 (1921). Conversely, one who acquired stock in 1912 for $291,600
and who sold the same in 1916 for only $269,346, incurred a loss and could not be
taxed at all, notwithstanding the fact that on March 1, 1913, his stock had depreci-
ated to $148,635. Walsh v. Brewster, 255 U.S. 536 (1921). On the other hand, al-
though the difference between the amount of life insurance premiums paid as of
1908, and the amount distributed in 1919, when the insured received the amount of
his policy plus cash dividends apportioned thereto since 1908, constituted a gain,
that portion of the latter that accrued between 1908 and 1913 was deemed to be an
accretion of capital and hence not taxable. Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U.S. 473 (1929).
     However, a litigant who, in 1915, reduced to judgment a suit pending on Febru-
ary 26, 1913, for an accounting under a patent infringement, was unable to have
treated as capital, and excluded from the taxable income produced by such settle-
ment, that portion of his claim that had accrued prior to March 1, 1913. Income
within the meaning of the Amendment was interpreted to be the fruit that is born
of capital, not the potency of fruition. All that the taxpayer possessed in 1913 was a
contingent chose in action that was inchoate, uncertain, and contested. United States
v. Safety Car Heating Co., 297 U.S. 88 (1936).
     Similarly, purchasers of coal lands subject to mining leases executed before adop-
tion of the Amendment could not successfully contend that royalties received during
1920–1926 were payments for capital assets sold before March 1, 1913, and hence
not taxable. Such an exemption, these purchasers argued, would have been in har-
mony with applicable local law under which title to coal passes immediately to the
lessee on execution of such leases. To the Court, however, such leases were not to be
viewed “as a ‘sale’ of the mineral content of the soil,” as minerals “may or may not
be present in the leased premises, and may or may not be found [therein]. . . . If
found, their abstraction . . . is a time-consuming operation and the payments made
by the lessee to the lessor do not normally become payable as the result of a single
transaction. . . .” The result for tax purposes would have been the same even had
the lease provided that title to the minerals would pass only “on severance by the
lessee.” Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S. 103, 107, 106, 111 (1932).
     44 274 U.S. 259 (1927).
     45 42 Stat. 227, 250, 268.
     46 274 U.S. at 263. Profits from illegal undertakings being taxable as income,

expenses in the form of salaries and rentals incurred by bookmakers are deductible.

     47 Rutkin v. United States, 343 U.S. 130 (1952). Four Justices—Black, Reed, Frank-

furter, and Douglas—dissented.
