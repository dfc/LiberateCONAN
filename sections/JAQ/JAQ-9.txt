     Whether subsidies paid to corporations in money or in the form
of grants of land or other physical property constitute taxable in-
come has also concerned the Court. In Edwards v. Cuba Rail-
road,33 it ruled that subsidies of lands, equipment, and money paid
by Cuba for the construction of a railroad were not taxable income
but were to be viewed as having been received by the railroad as a
reimbursement for capital expenditures in completing such project.
On the other hand, sums paid out by the Federal Government to
fulfill its guarantee of minimum operating revenue to railroads dur-
ing the six months following relinquishment of their control by that
government were found to be taxable income. Such payments were
distinguished from those excluded from computation of income in
the preceding case in that the former were neither bonuses, nor gifts,
nor subsidies, “that is, contributions to capital.” 34 Other corporate
receipts deemed to be taxable as income include the following: (1)
“insiders profits” realized by a director and stockholder of a corpo-
ration from transaction in its stock, which, as required by the Secu-
rities and Exchange Act,35 are paid over to the corporation; 36 (2)
money received as exemplary damages for fraud or as the punitive
two-thirds portion of a treble damage antitrust recovery; 37 and (3)
compensation awarded for the fair rental value of trucking facili-
ties operated by the taxpayer under control and possession of the
government during World War II, for in the last instance the gov-
ernment never acquired title to the property and had not damaged
it beyond ordinary wear.38
     Gains: When Taxable.—Although “economic gain is not al-
ways taxable as income, it is settled that the realization of gain
need not be in cash derived from the sale of an asset.” 39 Thus, when
through forfeiture of a lease, a landlord became possessed of a new
building erected on his land by the outgoing tenant, the resulting
gain to the former was taxable to him in that same year. “The fact
that the gain is a portion of the value of the property received by
the . . . [landlord] does not negative its realization. . . . It is not
necessary to recognition of taxable gain that . . . [the landlord] should
be able to sever the improvement begetting the gain from his origi-
nal capital.” Hence, the taxpayer was incorrect in contending “that
the Amendment does not permit the taxation of such [a] gain with-
