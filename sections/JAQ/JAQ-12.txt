lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express
or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to
their disposition, ‘he has received income which he is required to
return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled
to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged li-
able to restore its equivalent.’ ” 48
     Deductions and Exemptions.—The authorization contained in
the Sixteenth Amendment to tax income “from whatever source de-
rived” does not preclude Congress from granting exemptions.49 Thus,
the fact that, “[u]nder the Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917 and
1918, stock fire insurance companies were taxed upon their in-
come, including gains realized from the sale or other disposition of
property accruing subsequent to March 1, 1913,” but were not so
taxed by the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926, did not pre-
vent Congress, under the terms of the Revenue Act of 1928, from
taxing all the gain attributable to increase in value after March 1,
1913, that such a company realized from a sale of property in 1928.
The constitutional power of Congress to tax a gain being well-
established, the Court found Congress competent to choose “the mo-
ment of its realization and the amount realized”; and “[i]ts failure
to impose a tax upon the increase in value in the earlier years . . .
cannot preclude it from taxing the gain in the year when realized
. . . .” 50 Congress is equally well-equipped with the “power to con-
dition, limit, or deny deductions from gross incomes in order to ar-
rive at the net that it chooses to tax.” 51 Accordingly, even though
the rental value of a building used by its owner does not constitute
income within the meaning of the Amendment,52 Congress was com-
petent to provide that an insurance company shall not be entitled
to deductions for depreciation, maintenance, and property taxes on
real estate owned and occupied by it unless it includes in its com-
putation of gross income the rental value of the space thus used.53

contract for the purpose of earning profits are not capital investments, the cost of
which, if converted, must first be restored from the proceeds before there is a capi-
tal gain taxable as income. Accordingly, a dredging contractor, recovering a judg-
ment for breach of warranty of the character of the material to be dredged, must
include the amount thereof in the gross income of the year in which it was received,
rather than of the years during which the contract was performed, even though it
