                               THE PREAMBLE
    We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more
perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, pro-
vide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and
secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,
do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States
of America.
                  PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE PREAMBLE
             Although the preamble is not a source of power for any depart-
        ment of the Federal Government,1 the Supreme Court has often re-
        ferred to it as evidence of the origin, scope, and purpose of the Con-
        stitution.2 “Its true office,” wrote Joseph Story in his Commentaries,
        “is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers
        actually conferred by the Constitution, and not substantively to cre-
        ate them. For example, the preamble declares one object to be, ‘pro-
        vide for the common defense.’ No one can doubt that this does not
        enlarge the powers of Congress to pass any measures which they
        deem useful for the common defence. But suppose the terms of a
        given power admit of two constructions, the one more restrictive,
        the other more liberal, and each of them is consistent with the words,
        but is, and ought to be, governed by the intent of the power; if one
        could promote and the other defeat the common defence, ought not
        the former, upon the soundest principles of interpretation, to be ad-
        opted?” 3

            2 E.g., the Court has read the preamble as bearing witness to the fact that the
        Constitution emanated from the people and was not the act of sovereign and inde-
        pendent States. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819) Chisholm v.
        Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793); Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.)
        304 (1816), and that it was made for, and is binding only in, the United States of
        America. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901); In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453, 464 (1891).
