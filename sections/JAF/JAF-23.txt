priate federal rule, explicitly based on the judgment that the gov-
ernment had not proved facts constituting the offense.109 Even if,
as happened in Sanabria v. United States,110 the trial judge errone-
ously excludes evidence and then acquits on the basis that the re-
maining evidence is insufficient to convict, the judgment of acquit-
tal produced thereby is final and unreviewable.111
    Some limited exceptions exist with respect to the finality of trial
judge acquittal. First, because a primary purpose of the Due Pro-
cess Clause is the prevention of successive trials and not of prosecu-
tion appeals per se, it is apparently the case that, if the trial judge
permits the case to go to the jury, which convicts, and the judge
thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, even one founded upon
his belief that the evidence does not establish guilt, the prosecu-
tion may appeal, because the effect of a reversal would be not a
new trial but reinstatement of the jury’s verdict and the judgment
thereon.112 Second, if the trial judge enters or grants a motion of
acquittal, even one based on the conclusion that the evidence is in-
sufficient to convict, then the prosecution may appeal if jeopardy
had not yet attached in accordance with the federal standard.113
     Trial Court Rulings Terminating Trial Before Verdict.—
If, after jeopardy attaches, a trial judge grants a motion for mis-
trial, ordinarily the defendant is subject to retrial; 114 if, after jeop-
ardy attaches, but before a jury conviction occurs, the trial judge
acquits, perhaps on the basis that the prosecution has presented
insufficient evidence or that the defendant has proved a requisite

Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140 (1986) (demurrer sustained on basis of insuffi-
ciency of evidence is acquittal).
     110 437 U.S. 54 (1978).
     111 See also Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U.S. 462 (2005) (acquittal based on er-

roneous interpretation of precedent).
     112 In United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332 (1975), following a jury verdict to

convict, the trial judge granted defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground of preju-
dicial delay, not a judgment of acquittal; the Court permitted a government appeal
because reversal would have resulted in reinstatement of the jury’s verdict, not in a
retrial. In United States v. Jenkins, 420 U.S. 358, 365 (1975), the Court assumed,
on the basis of Wilson, that a trial judge’s acquittal of a defendant following a jury
conviction could be appealed by the government because, again, if the judge’s deci-
sion were set aside there would be no further proceedings at trial. In overruling
Jenkins in United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978), the Court noted the assump-
tion and itself assumed that a judgment of acquittal bars appeal only when a sec-
ond trial would be necessitated by reversal. Id. at 91 n.7.
     113 Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377 (1975) (after request for jury trial but

before attachment of jeopardy judge dismissed indictment because of evidentiary in-
sufficiency; appeal allowed); United States v. Sanford, 429 U.S. 14 (1976) (judge granted
mistrial after jury deadlock, then four months later dismissed indictment for insuf-
ficient evidence; appeal allowed, because granting mistrial had returned case to pre-
trial status).
