the possible unfairness of an absolute parcel-as-a-whole rule.709 Most
recently, however, in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Re-
gional Planning Agency,710 a six-justice majority including Justices
Kennedy and O’Connor offered a ringing endorsement of relevant-
parcel doctrine. Tahoe-Sierra affirmed the established spatial (court
must consider the entire relevant tract) and functional (court must
consider plaintiff ’s full bundle of rights) dimensions of the doc-
trine,711 and added a temporal one (court must consider the entire
time span of plaintiff ’s property interest). Invoking this temporal
dimension, the Court held that temporary land-use development mora-
toria do not effect a total elimination of use, since use and value
return in the period following the moratorium’s expiration. Thus,
such moratoria are to be tested under the ad hoc, multifactor Penn
Central test, rather than the per se approach to “total takings” dis-
cussed further on.
    In the course of its opinion in Penn Central the Court rejected
the principle that no compensation is required when regulation bans
a noxious or harmful effect of land use.712 The principle, it had been
contended, followed from several earlier cases, including Goldblatt
v. Town of Hempstead.713 In that case, after the town had ex-
panded around an excavation used by a company for mining sand
and gravel, the town enacted an ordinance that in effect termi-
nated further mining at the site. Declaring that no compensation
was owed, the Court stated that “[a] prohibition simply upon the
use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation,
to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community,
cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation
of property for the public benefit. Such legislation does not disturb
the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes,
nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by

     709 See, e.g., Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1016 n.7

(1992) (“answer . . . may lie in how the owner’s reasonable expectations have been
shaped by the State’s law of property”). Justice Kennedy provided extended dicta in
his majority opinion in Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, referring to this “difficult, persist-
ing question” and noting that “we have at times expressed discomfort with the logic
of this rule.” 533 U.S. 606, 631 (2001).
     710 535 U.S. 302 (2002).
     711 The spatial dimension is illustrated by the takings analysis in Penn Central,

declining to segment Grand Central Terminal from the air rights over it. Functional
parcel as a whole—refusing to segment one “stick” in the “bundle” of rights—was
applied in Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65–66 (1979), holding that denial of the
right to sell Indian artifacts was not a taking in light of rights in the artifacts that
were retained.
     712 The dissent was based upon this test. Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 144–46.
     713 369 U.S. 590 (1962). Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), and, per-

haps, Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272 (1928), also fall under this heading, although
Schoene may also be assigned to the public peril line of cases.
