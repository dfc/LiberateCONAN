free to resume his normal life activities after questioning.361 Never-
theless, a break in custody may not end all Miranda implications
for subsequent custodial interrogations.362
    Second, Miranda warnings must precede custodial interroga-
tion. It is not necessary under Miranda that the police squarely ask
a question. The breadth of the interrogation concept is demon-
strated in Rhode Island v. Innis.363 There, police had apprehended
the defendant as a murder suspect but had not found the weapon
used. While he was being transported to police headquarters in a
squad car, the defendant, who had been given the Miranda warn-
ings and had asserted he wished to consult a lawyer before submit-
ting to questioning, was not asked questions by the officers. How-
ever, the officers engaged in conversation among themselves, in which
they indicated that a school for handicapped children was near the
crime scene and that they hoped the weapon was found before a
child discovered it and was injured. The defendant then took them
to the weapon’s hiding place.
    Unanimously rejecting a contention that Miranda would have
been violated only by express questioning, the Court said: “We con-
clude that the Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a per-
son in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its func-
tional equivalent. That is to say, the term ‘interrogation’ under Miranda
refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or ac-
tions on the part of the police (other than those normally atten-
dant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reason-
ably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The
latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the percep-
tions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus
reflects the fact that the Miranda safeguards were designed to vest
a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against
coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the un-
derlying intent of the police.” 364 A divided Court then concluded that

in Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), which was decided under the Sixth Amend-
ment. In Brewer, and also in Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964), and
United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264 (1980), the Court has had difficulty in expound-
ing on what constitutes interrogation for Sixth Amendment counsel purposes. The
Innis Court indicated that the definitions are not the same for each Amendment.
