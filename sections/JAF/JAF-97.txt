which the individual is free to pursue, and it cannot be restricted
except for a proper governmental objective. Segregation in public
education is not reasonably related to any proper governmental ob-

lumbia a burden that constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of their
liberty in violation of the Due Process Clause.”
    “In view of our decision that the Constitution prohibits the states
from maintaining racially segregated public schools, it would be un-
thinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty
on the Federal Government.”
     In subsequent cases, the Court has applied its Fourteenth Amend-
ment jurisprudence to federal legislation that contained classifica-
tions based on sex 492 and illegitimacy,493 and that set standards of
eligibility for food stamps.494 However, almost all legislation in-
volves some degree of classification among particular categories of
persons, things, or events, and, just as the Equal Protection Clause
itself does not outlaw “reasonable” classifications, neither is the Due
Process Clause any more intolerant of the great variety of social
and economic legislation typically containing what must be arbi-
trary line-drawing.495 Thus, for example, the Court has sustained a
law imposing greater punishment for an offense involving rights of
property of the United States than for a like offense involving the
rights of property of a private person.496 A veterans law that ex-
tended certain educational benefits to all veterans who had served
“on active duty” and thereby excluded conscientious objectors from
eligibility was held to be sustainable, its being rational for Con-
gress to have determined that the disruption caused by military ser-
vice was qualitatively and quantitatively different from that caused
