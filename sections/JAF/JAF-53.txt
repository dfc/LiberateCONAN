the Court against self-incrimination challenges on the three grounds
that (1) the privilege did not excuse a complete failure to file, (2)
because the threshold decision to gamble was voluntary, the re-
quired disclosures were not compulsory, and (3) because registra-
tion required disclosure only of prospective conduct, the privilege,
limited to past or present acts, did not apply.263
     Constitutional limitations appeared, however, in Albertson v.
SACB,264 which struck down under the Self-Incrimination Clause
an order pursuant to statute requiring registration by individual
members of the Communist Party or associated organizations. “In
Sullivan the questions in the income tax return were neutral on
their face and directed at the public at large, but here they are di-
rected at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal ac-
tivities. Petitioners’ claims are not asserted in an essentially non-
criminal and regulatory area of inquiry, but against an inquiry in
an area permeated with criminal statutes, where response to any
of the form’s questions in context might involve the petitioners in
the admission of a crucial element of a crime.” 265
    The gambling tax reporting scheme was next struck down by
the Court.266 Because of the pervasiveness of state laws prohibiting
gambling, said Justice Harlan for the Court, “the obligations to reg-
ister and to pay the occupational tax created for petitioner ‘real and
appreciable,’ and not merely ‘imaginary and unsubstantial,’ haz-
ards of self-incrimination.” 267 Overruling Kahriger and Lewis, the
Court rejected its earlier rationales. Registering per se would have
exposed a gambler to dangers of state prosecution, so Sullivan did

     263 United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22 (1953); Lewis v. United States, 348

U.S. 419 (1955).
     264 382 U.S. 70 (1965).
     265 382 U.S. at 79. The decision was unanimous, with Justice White not partici-

pating. The same issue had been held not ripe for adjudication in Communist Party
v. SACB, 367 U.S. 1, 105–10 (1961).
     266 Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 (1968) (occupational tax); Grosso v.

United States, 390 U.S. 62 (1968) (wagering excise tax). In Haynes v. United States,
390 U.S. 85 (1968), the Court struck down a requirement that one register a fire-
arm that it was illegal to possess. The following Term on the same grounds the Court
voided a statute prohibiting the possession of marijuana without having paid a trans-
fer tax and registering. Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969); United States v.
Covington, 395 U.S. 57 (1969). However, a statute was upheld which prohibited the
sale of narcotics to a person who did not have a written order on a prescribed form,
since the requirement caused the self-incrimination of the buyer but not the seller,
the Court viewing the statute as actually a flat proscription on sale rather than a
regulatory measure. Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87 (1969). The congressional
response was reenactment of the requirements, coupled with use immunity. United
States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601 (1971).
     267 Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 48 (1968).
