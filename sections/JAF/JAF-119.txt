secrets.644 So too, the franchise of a private corporation is property
that cannot be taken for public use without compensation. Upon
condemnation of a lock and dam belonging to a navigation com-
pany, the government was required to pay for the franchise to take
tolls as well as for the tangible property.645 The frustration of a pri-
vate contract by the requisitioning of the entire output of a steel
manufacturer is not a taking for which compensation is re-
quired,646 but government requisitioning from a power company of
all the electric power which could be produced by use of the water
diverted through its intake canal, thereby cutting off the supply of
a lessee which had a right, amounting to a corporeal hereditament
under state law, to draw a portion of that water, entitles the lessee
to compensation for the rights taken.647 When, upon default of a
ship-builder, the Government, pursuant to contract with him, took
title to uncompleted boats, the material men, whose liens under state
laws had attached when they supplied the shipbuilder, had a compens-
able interest equal to whatever value these liens had when the gov-
ernment “took” or destroyed them in perfecting its title.648 As a gen-
eral matter, there is no property interest in the continuation of a
rule of law.649 And, even though state participation in the social se-
curity system was originally voluntary, a state had no property in-
terest in its right to withdraw from the program when Congress
had expressly reserved the right to amend the law and the agree-
ment with the state.650 Similarly, there is no right to the continua-
tion of governmental welfare benefits.651
