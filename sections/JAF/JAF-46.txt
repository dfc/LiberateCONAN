    The obligation to testify is not relieved by this clause, if, regard-
less of whether incriminating answers are given, a prosecution is
precluded,225 or if the result of the answers is not incrimination,
but rather harm to reputation or exposure to infamy or disgrace.226
The clause does not prevent a public employer from discharging an
employee who, in an investigation specifically and narrowly di-
rected at the performance of the employee’s official duties, refuses
to cooperate and to provide the employer with the desired informa-
tion on grounds of self-incrimination.227 But it is unclear under what
other circumstances a public employer may discharge an employee
who has claimed his privilege before another investigating agency.228
    Finally, the rules established by the clause and the judicial in-
terpretations apply against the states to the same degree that they
apply against the Federal Government,229 and neither sovereign can
compel discriminatory admissions that would incriminate the per-
son in the other jurisdiction.230 There is no “cooperative internation-

testimony would arise there, as it arises here, simply from the force of circum-
stances and not from any form of compulsion forbidden by the Constitution.” Yee
Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 185 (1925), quoted with approval in Turner v.
United States, 396 U.S. 398, 418 n.35 (1970). Justices Black and Douglas dissented
on self-incrimination grounds. Id. at 425. See also United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S.
63, 71, 74 (1965) (dissenting opinions). For due process limitations on such presump-
tions, see discussion under the Fourteenth Amendment, “Proof, Burden of Proof, and
Presumptions,” infra.
     225 Prosecution may be precluded by tender of immunity (see next topic for dis-

cussion of immunity), or by pardon, Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 598–99 (1896).
The effect of a mere tender of pardon by the President remains uncertain. Cf. Burdick
v. United States, 236 U.S. 79 (1915) (acceptance necessary, and self-incrimination is
possible in absence of acceptance); Biddle v. Perovich, 274 U.S. 480 (1927) (accep-
tance not necessary to validate commutation of death sentence to life imprison-
ment).
     226 Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 605–06 (1896); Ullmann v. United States,

350 U.S. 422, 430–31 (1956). Minorities in both cases had contended for a broader
rule. Walker, 161 U.S. at 631 (Justice Field dissenting); Ullmann, 350 U.S. at 454
(Justice Douglas dissenting).
     227 Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 278 (1968). Testimony compelled under

such circumstances is, even in the absence of statutory immunity, barred from use
in a subsequent criminal trial by force of the Fifth Amendment itself. Garrity v. New
Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). However, unlike public employees, persons subject to
professional licensing by government appear to be able to assert their privilege and
retain their licenses. Cf. Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967) (lawyer may not be
disbarred solely because he refused on self-incrimination grounds to testify at a dis-
ciplinary proceeding), approved in Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. at 277–78. Jus-
tices Harlan, Clark, Stewart, and White dissented generally. 385 U.S. 500, 520, 530.
     228 See Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 350 U.S. 551 (1956), limited by

Lerner v. Casey, 357 U.S. 468 (1958), and Nelson v. County of Los Angeles, 362 U.S.
1 (1960), which were in turn apparently limited by Garrity and Gardner.
