efit Act’s requirement that companies formerly engaged in mining
pay miner retiree health benefits, as applied to a company that spun
off its mining operation in 1965 before collective bargaining agree-
ments included an express promise of lifetime benefits.
     On the other hand, a federal ban on the sale of artifacts made
from eagle feathers was sustained as applied to the existing inven-
tory of a commercial dealer in such artifacts, the Court not directly
addressing the ban’s obvious interference with investment-backed
expectations.706 The Court merely noted that the ban served a sub-
stantial public purpose in protecting the eagle from extinction, that
the owner still had viable economic uses for his holdings, such as
displaying them in a museum and charging admission, and that he
still had the value of possession.707
      The Court has made plain that, in applying the economic im-
pact and investment-backed expectations factors of Penn Central,
courts are to compare what the property owner has lost through
the challenged government action with what the owner retains. Dis-
charging this mandate requires a court to define the extent of plain-
tiff ’s property—the “parcel as a whole”—that sets the scope of analy-
sis. The Supreme Court holds that takings law “does not divide a
single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether
rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated.” 708 But,
although this apparently means that one may not exclude acreage
from the relevant parcel solely to isolate the regulated portion, there
are numerous arguments for excluding acreage (purchased by plain-
tiff at a different time, in different zoning status, etc.) that the Court
has not addressed. And roiling the waters are persistent expres-
sions of concern by the conservative justices, often in dicta, about

stantive due process, not takings law, to provide the analytical framework where, as
in Eastern Enterprises, the gravamen of the complaint is the unfairness and irratio-
nality of the statute, rather than its economic impact.
     706 Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51 (1979).
     707 Similarly, the Court in Goldblatt had pointed out that the record contained

no indication that the mining prohibition would reduce the value of the property in
question. 369 U.S. at 594. Contrast Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987), where the
Court found insufficient justification for a complete abrogation of the right to pass
on to heirs interests in certain fractionated property. Note as well the differing views
expressed in Irving as to whether that case limits Andrus v. Allard to its facts. Id.
at 718 (Justice Brennan concurring, 719 (Justice Scalia concurring). See also the
suggestion in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1027–28 (1992),
that Allard may rest on a distinction between permissible regulation of personal
property, on the one hand, and real property, on the other.
     708 Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130. The identical principle was reaffirmed in Key-

stone Bituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 497 (1987); Concrete
Pipe & Products of California, Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust, 508 U.S.
602, 644 (1993); and Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 327 (2002).
