stitutional rule grew to four.344 Also, that Miranda may be rooted
in the Constitution does not, according to the Court, mean that the
precise articulation of the warnings in it is “immutable.” 345
     Beyond finding that Miranda has, at the least, “constitutional
underpinnings,” the Dickerson Court also rejected a request to over-
rule Miranda. “Whether or not we would agree with Miranda’s rea-
soning and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the
first instance,” Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the seven-Justice
majority, “the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against over-
ruling it now.” There was no special justification for overruling the
decision; subsequent cases had not undermined the decision’s doc-
trinal underpinnings, but rather had “reaffirm[ed]” its “core rul-
ing.” Moreover, Miranda warnings had “become so embedded in rou-
tine police practice [that they] have become part of our national
culture.” 346
    As to the viability of Miranda claims in federal habeas corpus
cases, the Court had suggested in 1974 that most claims could be
disallowed,347 but such a course was squarely rejected in 1993. The
Court ruled in Withrow v. Williams that Miranda protects a funda-
mental trial right of the defendant, unlike the Fourth Amendment
exclusionary rule addressed in Stone v. Powell,348 and claimed vio-
lations of Miranda merited federal habeas corpus review because
they relate to the correct ascertainment of guilt.349 The purposes of

     347 In Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 439 (1974), the Court had suggested a

distinction between a constitutional violation and a violation of “the prophylactic rules
developed to protect that right.” The actual holding in Tucker, however, had turned
on the fact that the interrogation had preceded the Miranda decision and that warn-
ings—albeit not full Miranda warnings—had been given.

     349 507 U.S. 680 (1993). Even though a state prisoner’s Miranda claim may be

considered in federal habeas review, the scope of federal habeas review is narrow.
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a state
court judgment may be set aside on habeas review only if the judgment is found to
be contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court
precedent. By contrast, a federal court reviewing a state court judgment on direct
review considers federal legal questions de novo and can overturn a state court hold-
ing based on its own independent assessment of federal legal issues. This difference
in scope of review can be critical. Compare Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652
(2004) (habeas petition denied because state court’s refusal to take a juvenile’s age
into account in applying Miranda was not an unreasonable application of clearly
established Supreme Court precedent), with J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. ___,
No. 09–11121, slip op. (2011) (on the Court’s de novo review of the age issue, state
court’s refusal to take a juvenile’s age into account in applying Miranda held to be
in error, and case remanded).
