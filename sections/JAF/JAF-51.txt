    Required Records Doctrine.—Although the privilege is appli-
cable to an individual’s papers and effects,253 it does not extend to
corporate persons; hence corporate records, as has been noted, are
subject to compelled production.254 In fact, however, the Court has
greatly narrowed the protection afforded in this area to natural per-
sons by developing the “required records” doctrine. That is, it has
held “that the privilege which exists as to private papers cannot be
maintained in relation to ‘records required by law to be kept in or-
der that there may be suitable information of transactions which
are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation and the en-
forcement of restrictions validly established.’ ” 255 This exception de-
veloped out of, as Justice Frankfurter showed in dissent, the rule
that documents which are part of the official records of government
are wholly outside the scope of the privilege; public records are the
property of government and are always accessible to inspection. Be-
cause government requires certain records to be kept to facilitate
the regulation of the business being conducted, so the reasoning goes,
the records become public at least to the degree that government
could always scrutinize them without hindrance from the record-
keeper. “If records merely because required to be kept by law ipso
facto become public records, we are indeed living in glass houses.
Virtually every major public law enactment—to say nothing of State
and local legislation—has record-keeping provisions. In addition to
record-keeping requirements, is the network of provisions for filing
reports. Exhaustive efforts would be needed to track down all the
statutory authority, let alone the administrative regulations, for record-
keeping and reporting requirements. Unquestionably they are enor-
mous in volume.” 256
    “It may be assumed at the outset that there are limits which
the government cannot constitutionally exceed in requiring the keep-
ing of records which may be inspected by an administrative agency
and may be used in prosecuting statutory violations committed by

380 (1911)). Dicta in Wilson is the source of the required-records doctrine, the hold-
ing of the case being the familiar one that a corporate officer cannot claim the privi-
lege against self-incrimination to refuse to surrender corporate records in his cus-
tody. Cf. Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131 (1913). Davis was a search and seizure
case and dealt with gasoline ration coupons which were government property even
though in private possession. See Shapiro, 335 U.S. at 36, 56–70 (Justice Frank-
furter dissenting).
