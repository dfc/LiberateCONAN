requirement.700 The tests become more useful, however, when com-
pliance with regulation becomes more onerous.
     Several times the Court has relied on the concept of “distinct
[or, in most later cases, ‘reasonable’] investment-backed expecta-
tions” first introduced in Penn Central. In Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto
Co.,701 the Court used the concept to determine whether a taking
had resulted from the government’s disclosure of trade secret infor-
mation submitted with applications for pesticide registrations. Dis-
closure of data that had been submitted from 1972 to 1978, a pe-
riod when the statute guaranteed confidentiality and thus “formed
the basis of a distinct investment-backed expectation,” would have
destroyed the property value of the trade secret and constituted a
taking.702 Following 1978 amendments setting forth conditions of
data disclosure, however, applicants voluntarily submitting data in
exchange for the economic benefits of registration had no reason-
able expectation of additional protections of confidentiality.703 Rely-
ing less heavily on the concept but rejecting an assertion that rea-
sonable investment backed-expectations had been upset, the Court
in Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.704 upheld retroactive
imposition of liability for pension plan withdrawal on the basis that
employers had at least constructive notice that Congress might but-
tress the legislative scheme to accomplish its legislative aim that
employees receive promised benefits. However, where a statute im-
poses severe and “substantially disproportionate” retroactive liabil-
ity based on conduct several decades earlier, on parties that could
not have anticipated the liability, a taking (or violation of due pro-
cess) may occur. On this rationale, the Court in Eastern Enter-
prises v. Apfel 705 struck down the Coal Miner Retiree Health Ben-
     700 Texaco v. Short, 454 U.S. 516 (1982) (state statute deeming mineral claims

lapsed upon failure of putative owners to take prescribed steps is not a taking); United
States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84 (1985) (reasonable regulation of recordation of mining
claim is not a taking).
     701 467 U.S. 986 (1984).
     702 467 U.S. at 1011.
     703 467 U.S. at 1006–07. Similarly, disclosure of data submitted before the con-

fidentiality guarantee was placed in the law did not frustrate reasonable expecta-
tions, the Trade Secrets Act merely protecting against “unauthorized” disclosure. Id.
at 1008–10.
     704 475 U.S. 211 (1986). Accord, Concrete Pipe & Products v. Construction Labor-

ers Pension Trust, 508 U.S. 602, 645–46 (1993). In addition, see Kaiser Aetna v. United
States, 444 U.S. 164, 179 (1979) (involving frustration of “expectancies” developed
through improvements to private land and governmental approval of permits), and
PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 84 (1980) (characterizing and
distinguishing Kaiser Aetna as involving interference with “reasonable investment
backed expectations”).
     705 524 U.S. 498 (1998). The split doctrinal basis of Eastern Enterprises under-

cuts its precedent value, and that of Connolly and Concrete Pipe, for takings law. A
majority of the justices (one supporting the judgment and four dissenters) found sub-
