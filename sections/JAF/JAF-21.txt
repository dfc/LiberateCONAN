sion, and enter a judgment of conviction.99 Previously, under the
Due Process Clause, there was no barrier to state provision for
prosecutorial appeals from acquittals.100 But there are instances in
which the trial judge will dismiss the indictment or information with-
out intending to acquit or in circumstances in which retrial would
not be barred, and the prosecution, of course, has an interest in
seeking on appeal to have errors corrected. Until 1971, however,
the law providing for federal appeals was extremely difficult to ap-
ply and insulated from review many purportedly erroneous legal rul-
ings,101 but in that year Congress enacted a new statute permit-
ting appeals in all criminal cases in which indictments are dismissed,
except in those cases in which the Double Jeopardy Clause prohib-
its further prosecution.102 In part because of the new law, the Court
has dealt in recent years with a large number of problems in this
area.
    Acquittal by Jury.—Little or no controversy accompanies the
rule that once a jury has acquitted a defendant, government may
not, through appeal of the verdict or institution of a new prosecu-
tion, place the defendant on trial again.103 Thus, the Court early
held that, when the results of a trial are set aside because the first

     99 In dissent, Justice Holmes, joined by three other Justices, propounded a theory

of “continuing jeopardy,” so that until the case was finally concluded one way or
another, through judgment of conviction or acquittal, and final appeal, there was no
second jeopardy no matter how many times a defendant was tried. 195 U.S. at 134.
The Court has numerous times rejected any concept of “continuing jeopardy.” E.g.,
Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 192 (1957); United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S.
332, 351–53 (1975); Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 533–35 (1975).
     100 Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937). Palko is no longer viable. Cf. Greene

v. Massey, 437 U.S. 19 (1978).
     101 The Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, was “a failure . . . , a most

unruly child that has not improved with age.” United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267,
307 (1970). See also United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U.S. 85 (1916); Fong Foo v.
United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962).
     102 Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act, Pub. L. 91–644, 84 Stat. 1890,

18 U.S.C. § 3731. Congress intended to remove all statutory barriers to governmen-
tal appeal and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit, so that
interpretation of the statute requires constitutional interpretation as well. United
States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 337 (1974). See Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S.
54, 69 n.23 (1978), and id. at 78 (Justice Stevens concurring).
     103 What constitutes a jury acquittal may occasionally be uncertain. In Blueford

v. Arkansas, 566 U.S. ___, No. 10–1320, slip op. (2012), the defendant was charged
with capital murder in an “acquittal-first” jurisdiction, in which the jury must unani-
mously agree that a defendant is not guilty of a greater offense before it may begin
to consider a lesser included offense. After several hours of deliberations, the foreperson
of the jury stated in open court that the jury was unanimously against conviction
for capital murder and the lesser included offense of first degree murder, but was
deadlocked on manslaughter, the next lesser included offense. After further delibera-
tions, the judge declared a mistrial because of a hung jury. Six Justices of the Court
subsequently held that the foreperson’s statement on capital murder and first de-
