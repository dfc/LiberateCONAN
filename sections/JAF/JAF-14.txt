may not be considered punitive for purposes of double jeopardy analy-
sis.63 and the same is true of civil commitment following expiration
of a prison term.64
     Because a prime purpose of the clause is to protect against the
burden of multiple trials, a defendant who raises and loses a double
jeopardy claim during pretrial or trial may immediately appeal the
ruling; this is a rare exception to the general rule prohibiting ap-
peals from nonfinal orders.65
     During the 1970s, the Court decided an uncommonly large num-
ber of cases raising double jeopardy claims.66 Instead of the clarity
that often emerges from intense consideration of a particular issue,
however, double jeopardy doctrine has descended into a state of “con-
fusion,” with the Court acknowledging that its decisions “can hardly
be characterized as models of consistency and clarity.” 67 In large
part, the re-evaluation of doctrine and principle has not resulted in
the development of clear and consistent guidelines because of the
differing emphases of the Justices upon the purposes of the clause
and the consequent shifting coalition of majorities based on highly
technical distinctions and individualistic fact patterns. Thus, some
Justices have expressed the belief that the purpose of the clause is
only to protect final judgments relating to culpability, either of ac-
quittal or conviction, and that English common law rules designed
to protect the defendant’s right to go to the first jury picked had
early in our jurisprudence become confused with the Double Jeop-
ardy Clause. Although they accept the present understanding, they
do so as part of the Court’s superintending of the federal courts and
not because the understanding is part and parcel of the clause; in
so doing, of course, they are likely to find more prosecutorial discre-
     63 United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267 (1996) (forfeitures, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.

§ 981 and 21 U.S.C. § 881, of property used in drug and money laundering offenses,
are not punitive). The Court in Ursery applied principles that had been set forth in
Various Items of Personal Property v. United States, 282 U.S. 577 (1931) (forfeiture
of distillery used in defrauding government of tax on spirits), and United States v.
One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U.S. 354 (1984) (forfeiture, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(d), of firearms “used or intended to be used in” firearms offenses). A two-part
inquiry is followed. First, the Court inquires whether Congress intended the forfei-
ture proceeding to be civil or criminal. Then, if Congress intended that the proceed-
ing be civil, the court determines whether there is nonetheless the “clearest proof ”
that the sanction is “so punitive” as to transform it into a criminal penalty. 89 Fire-

     67 Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 9, 15 (1978). One result is instability in

the law. Thus, Burks overruled, to the extent inconsistent, four cases decided be-
tween 1950 and 1960, and United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978), overruled a
case decided just three years earlier, United States v. Jenkins, 420 U.S. 358 (1975).
