enjoy its benefits and must bear its burdens. Since no citizen en-
joys immunity from that burden, its retroactive imposition does not
necessarily infringe due process, and to challenge the present tax
it is not enough to point out that the taxable event, the receipt of
income, antedated the statute.” 539 A special income tax on profits
realized by the sale of silver, retroactive for 35 days, which was ap-
proximately the period during which the silver purchase bill was
before Congress, was held valid.540 An income tax law, made retro-
active to the beginning of the calendar year in which it was ad-
opted, was found constitutional as applied to the gain from the sale,
shortly before its enactment, of property received as a gift during
the year.541 Retroactive assessment of penalties for fraud or negli-
gence,542 or of an additional tax on the income of a corporation used
to avoid a surtax on its shareholder,543 does not deprive the tax-
payer of property without due process of law.
     An additional excise tax imposed upon property still held for
sale, after one excise tax had been paid by a previous owner, does
not violate the Due Process Clause.544 Similarly upheld were a trans-
fer tax measured in part by the value of property held jointly by a
husband and wife, including that which comes to the joint tenancy
as a gift from the decedent spouse 545 and the inclusion in the gross
income of the settlor of income accruing to a revocable trust during
any period when the settlor had power to revoke or modify it.546
     Although the Court during the 1920s struck down gift taxes im-
posed retroactively upon gifts that were made and completely vested
before the enactment of the taxing statute,547 those decisions have
recently been distinguished, and their precedential value lim-
ited.548 In United States v. Carlton, the Court declared that “[t]he
