the opposing argument that the amount of compensation to be awarded
in a state eminent domain case is solely a matter of local law. On
the contrary, the Court ruled, although a state “legislature may pre-
scribe a form of procedure to be observed in the taking of private
property for public use, . . . it is not due process of law if provision
be not made for compensation. . . . The mere form of the proceed-
ing instituted against the owner . . . cannot convert the process used
into due process of law, if the necessary result be to deprive him of
his property without compensation.” 593 Although the guarantees of
just compensation flow from two different sources, the standards
used by the Court in dealing with the issues appear to be identical,
and both federal and state cases will be dealt with herein without
expressly continuing to recognize the two different bases for the rul-
ings.
    The power of eminent domain is inherent in government and
may be exercised only through legislation or legislative delegation.
Although such delegation is usually to another governmental body,
it may also be to private corporations, such as public utilities, rail-
road companies, or bridge companies, when they are promoting a
valid public purpose.594

Public Use
    Explicit in the Just Compensation Clause is the requirement
that the taking of private property be for a public use; one cannot
be deprived of his property for any reason other than a public use,
even with compensation.595 The question whether a particular in-
tended use is a public use is clearly a judicial one,596 but the Court
has always insisted on a high degree of judicial deference to the
legislative determination.597 “The role of the judiciary in determin-
ing whether that power is being exercised for a public use is an
extremely narrow one.” 598 When it is state action being challenged
under the Fourteenth Amendment, there is the additional factor of

     594 Noble v. Oklahoma City, 297 U.S. 481 (1936); Luxton v. North River Bridge

Co., 153 U.S. 525 (1895). One of the earliest examples of such delegation is Curtiss
v. Georgetown & Alexandria Turnpike Co., 10 U.S. (6 Cr.) 233 (1810).

     596 “It is well established that in considering the application of the Fourteenth

Amendment to cases of expropriation of private property, the question what is a pub-
lic use is a judicial one.” City of Cincinnati v. Vester, 281 U.S. 439, 444 (1930).
     597 Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469, 482 (2005). The taking need only

be “rationally related to a conceivable public purpose.” Id. at 490 (Justice Kennedy
concurring).
