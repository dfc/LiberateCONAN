the Miranda rule differed from the Mapp v. Ohio 350 exclusionary
rule denied enforcement in habeas proceedings in Stone, the Court
explained, because the primary purpose of Mapp was to deter fu-
ture Fourth Amendment violations, a purpose that the Court claimed
would only be marginally advanced by allowing collateral re-
view.351 A further consideration was that eliminating review of Miranda
claims would not significantly reduce federal habeas review of state
convictions, because most Miranda claims could be recast in terms
of due process denials resulting from admission of involuntary con-
fessions.352
    In any event, the Court has established several lines of deci-
sions interpreting key aspects of Miranda.
     First, Miranda warnings must be given prior to “questioning
initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken
into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any
significant way.” 353 The cases have distilled “custody or other sig-
nificant deprivation of action” into a two-part assessment under which
restricting a person’s movement is a necessary but not sufficient el-
ement. Not all inhibitions of “free movement” trigger Miranda.
Whether a person is “in custody” during questioning depends on the
coercive pressure posed. The Court applies an objective, context-
specific test of how intimidated a reasonable person in the sus-
pect’s shoes would feel to freely exercise his right against self-
incrimination. A police officer’s subjective and undisclosed view that
a person being interrogated is a criminal suspect is not relevant
for Miranda purposes, nor is the subjective view of the person be-
ing questioned.354 The only refinement to this one-size-fits-all rea-
sonable person test is consideration of age if the detainee is a juve-
nile.355
    An ordinary traffic stop does not to amount to Miranda “cus-
tody.” 356 Nor do all interrogations of prison inmates about previous
outside conduct, even if the inmate is isolated from the general prison

tion is curtailed to a ‘degree associated with formal arrest’ ”). Thus, “custody” for
self-incrimination purposes under the Fifth Amendment does not necessarily cover
all detentions that are “seizures” under the Fourth Amendment. Id.
