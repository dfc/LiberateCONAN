this regard. The Court’s first zoning case involved a real estate com-
pany’s challenge to a comprehensive municipal zoning ordinance,
alleging that the ordinance prevented development of its land for
industrial purposes and thereby reduced its value from $10,000 an
acre to $2,500 an acre.689 Acknowledging that zoning was of recent
origin, the Court observed that it must find its justification in the
police power and be evaluated by the constitutional standards ap-
plied to exercises of the police power. After considering traditional
nuisance law, the Court determined that the public interest was served
by segregation of incompatible land uses and the ordinance was thus
valid on its face; whether its application to diminish property val-
ues in any particular case was also valid would depend, the Court
said, upon a finding that it was not “clearly arbitrary and unreason-
able, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, mor-
als, or general welfare.” 690 A few years later the Court, again rely-
ing on due process rather than taking law, did invalidate the
application of a zoning ordinance to a tract of land, finding that
the tract would be rendered nearly worthless and that to exempt
the tract would impair no substantial municipal interest.691 But then
the Court withdrew from the land-use scene until the 1970s, giving
little attention to states and their municipalities as they developed
more comprehensive zoning techniques.692
    As governmental regulation of property has expanded over the
years—in terms of zoning and other land use controls, environmen-
tal regulations, and the like—the Court never developed, as it ad-
mitted, a “set formula to determine where regulation ends and tak-
ing begins.” 693 Rather, as one commentator remarked, its decisions
constitute a “crazy quilt pattern” of judgments.694 Nonetheless, the
Court has now formulated general principles that guide many of
its decisions in the area.

construed as to bar a grandmother from living with two grandchildren of different
children). See also City of Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, 426 U.S. 668 (1976).
