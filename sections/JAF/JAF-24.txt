defense such as insanity or entrapment, the defendant is not sub-
ject to retrial.115 However, it may be that the trial judge will grant
a motion to dismiss that is neither a mistrial nor an acquittal, but
is instead a termination of the trial in defendant’s favor based on
some decision not relating to his factual guilt or innocence, such as
prejudicial preindictment delay.116 The prosecution may not simply
begin a new trial but must seek first to appeal and overturn the
dismissal, a course that was not open to federal prosecutors until
enactment of the Omnibus Crime Control Act in 1971.117 That law
has resulted in tentative and uncertain rulings with respect to when
such dismissals may be appealed and further proceedings directed.
In the first place, it is unclear in many instances whether a judge’s
ruling is a mistrial, a dismissal, or an acquittal.118 In the second
place, because the Justices have such differing views about the poli-
cies underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause, determinations of which
dismissals preclude appeals and further proceedings may result from
shifting coalitions and from revised perspectives. Thus, the Court
first fixed the line between permissible and impermissible appeals
at the point at which further proceedings would have had to take
place in the trial court if the dismissal were reversed. If the only
thing that had to be done was to enter a judgment on a guilty ver-
dict after reversal, appeal was constitutional and permitted under
the statute; 119 if further proceedings, such as continuation of the
trial or some further factfinding, was necessary, appeal was not per-
mitted.120 Now, but by a close division of the Court, the determin-
ing factor is not whether further proceedings must be had but whether
the action of the trial judge, whatever its label, correct or not, re-
solved some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged in
defendant’s favor, whether, that is, the court made some determina-
