be found guilty.” 39 A second “vitally important interest[ ]” embod-
ied in the Double Jeopardy Clause “is the preservation of ‘the final-
ity of judgments.’ ” 40
     The concept of double jeopardy goes far back in history, but its
development was uneven and its meaning has varied. The English
development, under the influence of Coke and Blackstone, came gradu-
ally to mean that a defendant at trial could plead former convic-
tion or former acquittal as a special plea in bar to defeat the pros-
ecution.41 In this country, the common-law rule was in some cases
limited to this rule and in other cases extended to bar a new trial
even though the former trial had not concluded in either an acquit-
tal or a conviction. The rule’s elevation to fundamental status by
its inclusion in several state bills of rights following the Revolution
continued the differing approaches.42 Madison’s version of the guar-
antee as introduced in the House of Representatives read: “No per-
son shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than
one punishment or trial for the same offense.” 43 Opposition in the
House proceeded on the proposition that the language could be con-
strued to prohibit a second trial after a successful appeal by a de-
fendant and would therefore either constitute a hazard to the pub-
lic by freeing the guilty or, more likely, result in a detriment to
defendants because appellate courts would be loath to reverse con-
victions if no new trial could follow, but a motion to strike “or trial”
from the clause failed.44 As approved by the Senate, however, and
