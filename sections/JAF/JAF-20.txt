may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial
after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.” There-
fore, ordinarily, a defendant who moves for or acquiesces in a mis-
trial is bound by his decision and may be required to stand for re-
trial.

Reprosecution Following Acquittal
     That a defendant may not be retried following an acquittal is
“the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy juris-
prudence.” 94 “[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquit-
tal. To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken
the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high
risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might
wear down the defendant so that ‘even though innocent he may be
found guilty.’ ” 95 Thus, an acquittal resting on the trial judge’s mis-
reading of an offense precludes further prosecution.96 Although in
other areas of double jeopardy doctrine consideration is given to the
public-safety interest in having a criminal trial proceed to an error-
free conclusion, no such balancing of interests is permitted with re-
spect to acquittals, “no matter how erroneous,” no matter even if
they were “egregiously erroneous.” 97
    The acquittal being final, there is no governmental appeal con-
stitutionally possible from such a judgment. This was firmly estab-
lished in Kepner v. United States,98 which arose under a Philip-
pines appeals system in which the appellate court could make an
independent review of the record, set aside the trial judge’s deci-

key witness a prejudicial question. Four Justices concurred, noting that the ques-
tion did not constitute overreaching or harassment and objecting both to the Court’s
reaching the broader issue and to its narrowing the exception. Id. at 681.
     94 United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977).
     95 United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 91 (1978) (quoting Green v. United States,

355 U.S. 184, 188 (1957)). For the conceptually related problem of trial for a “sepa-
rate” offense arising out of the same “transaction,” see discussion under “The ‘Same
Transaction’ Problem,” infra.
     96 Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.S. ___, No. 11–1327, slip op. (2013) (acquittal after

judge ruled the prosecution failed to prove that a burned building was not a dwell-
ing, but such proof was not legally required for the arson offense charged).
     97 Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 16 (1978); Fong Foo v. United States, 369

U.S. 141, 143 (1962). For evaluation of those interests of the defendant that might
support the absolute rule of finality, and rejection of all such interests save the right
of the jury to acquit against the evidence and the trial judge’s ability to temper leg-
islative rules with leniency, see Westen & Drubel, Toward a General Theory of Double
Jeopardy, 1978 SUP. CT. REV. 81, 122–37.
     98 195 U.S. 100 (1904). The case interpreted not the constitutional provision but

a statutory provision extending double jeopardy protection to the Philippines. The
Court has described the case, however, as correctly stating constitutional principles.
See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 346 n.15 (1975); United States v.
DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 113 n.13 (1980).
