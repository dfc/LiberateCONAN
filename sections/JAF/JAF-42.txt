existence, custody, or authenticity of the documents, then the privi-
lege is implicated.202 Application of these principles resulted in a
holding that the Independent Counsel could not base a prosecution
on incriminating evidence identified and produced as the result of
compliance with a broad subpoena for all information relating to
the individual’s income, employment, and professional relation-
ships.203
     The protection is against “compulsory” incrimination, and tradi-
tionally the Court has treated within the clause only those compul-
sions which arise from legally enforceable obligations, culminating
in imprisonment for refusal to testify or to produce documents.204
The compulsion need not be imprisonment, but can also be termi-
nation of public employment 205 or disbarment of a lawyer 206 as a
legal consequence of a refusal to make incriminating admissions.
The degree of coercion may also prove decisive, the Court having
ruled that moving a prisoner from a medium security unit to a maxi-
mum security unit was insufficient to compel him to incriminate
himself in spite of the attendant loss of privileges and the harsher
living conditions.207 However, although it appears that prisoners 208

     202 In United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605 (1984), the Court distinguished Fisher,

upholding lower courts’ findings that the act of producing tax records implicates the
privilege because it would compel admission that the records exist, that they were
in the taxpayer’s possession, and that they are authentic. Similarly, a juvenile court’s
order to produce a child implicates the privilege, because the act of compliance “would
amount to testimony regarding [the subject’s] control over and possession of [the
child].” Baltimore Dep’t of Social Services v. Bouknight, 493 U.S. 549, 555 (1990).

tached to failure to register and make incriminating admissions); Malloy v. Hogan,

Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) (no compulsion in introducing evidence of suspect’s re-
fusal to submit to blood alcohol test, since state could have forced suspect to take
test and need not have offered him a choice); Selective Service System v. Minnesota

financial assistance for higher education reveal whether they have registered for draft).

tional state statutes requiring the disqualification for five years of contractors doing
business with the state if at any time they refused to waive immunity and answer
questions respecting their transactions with the state. The state may require employ-
ees or contractors to respond to inquiries, but only if it offers them immunity suffi-
cient to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination. See also Lefkowitz v. Cun-

to participate in a sexual abuse treatment program that required revelation of sexual
history and admission of responsibility. The plurality declared that rehabilitation
programs are permissible if the adverse consequences for non-participation are “re-
lated to the program objectives and do not constitute atypical and significant hard-
