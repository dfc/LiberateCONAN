ration. Thus, a corporation cannot object on self-incrimination grounds
to a subpoena of its records and books or to the compelled testi-
mony of those corporate agents who have been given personal im-
munity from criminal prosecution.193 Nor may a corporate official
with custody of corporate documents that incriminate him person-
ally resist their compelled production on the assertion of his per-
sonal privilege.194
    A witness has traditionally been able to claim the privilege in
any proceeding whatsoever in which testimony is legally required
when his answer might be used against him in that proceeding or
in a future criminal proceeding or when it might be exploited to
uncover other evidence against him.195 Incrimination is not com-
plete once guilt has been adjudicated, and hence the privilege may
be asserted during the sentencing phase of trial.196 Conversely, there
is no valid claim on the ground that the information sought can be
used in proceedings which are not criminal in nature,197 and there

ICC, 221 U.S. 612 (1911); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 69–70, 74–75 (1906).
     194 United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 699–700 (1944); Wilson v. United States,

221 U.S. 361, 384–385 (1911). But the government may make no evidentiary use of
the act of production in proceeding individually against the corporate custodian. Braswell
v. United States, 487 U.S. 99 (1988). Cf. George Campbell Painting Corp. v. Reid,
392 U.S. 286 (1968); United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752 (1983) (witness who
had failed to appeal production order and thus had burden in contempt proceeding
to show inability to then produce records could not rely on privilege to shift this
evidentiary burden).
     195 Thus, not only may a defendant or a witness in a criminal trial, including a

juvenile proceeding, In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 42–57 (1967), claim the privilege but so
may a party or a witness in a civil court proceeding, McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266
U.S. 34 (1924), a potential defendant or any other witness before a grand jury, Reina
v. United States, 364 U.S. 507 (1960); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 563
(1892), or a witness before a legislative inquiry, Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S.
178, 195–96 (1957); Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. 155 (1955); Emspak v. United
States, 349 U.S. 190 (1955), or before an administrative body. In re Groban, 352
U.S. 330, 333, 336–37, 345–46 (1957); ICC v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 478–80 (1894).

distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of respondent’s capital murder trial
so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned”); Mitchell v.
United States, 526 U.S. 314 (1999) (non-capital sentencing).
     197 Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364 (1986) (declaration that person is “sexually dan-

gerous” under Illinois law is not a criminal proceeding); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465
U.S. 420, 435 n.7 (1984) (revocation of probation is not a criminal proceeding, hence
“there can be no valid claim of the privilege on the ground that the information
sought can be used in revocation proceedings”). In Murphy, the Court went on to
explain that “a State may validly insist on answers to even incriminating questions
and hence sensibly administer its probation system, as long as it recognizes that
the required answers may not be used in a criminal proceeding and thus eliminates
the threat of incrimination. Under such circumstances, a probationer’s ‘right to im-
munity as a result of his compelled testimony would not be at stake,’ and nothing in
the Federal Constitution would prevent a State from revoking probation for a re-
fusal to answer . . . .” Id. (citations omitted).
