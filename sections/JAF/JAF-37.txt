privilege against self-incrimination in their constitutions,178 and the
privilege was one of those recommended by several state ratifying
conventions for inclusion in a federal bill of rights.179 Madison’s ver-
sion of the clause read “nor shall be compelled to be a witness against
himself,” but a House amendment inserted “in any criminal case”
into the provision.180
    The historical studies cited demonstrate that in England and
the colonies the privilege was narrower than the interpretation now
prevailing. Of course, constitutional guarantees often expand, or con-
tract, over time as judges adapt underlying policies to new factual
patterns and practices. The difficulty is that the Court has gener-
ally failed to articulate the policy objectives underlying the privi-
lege, usually citing a “complex of values” when it has attempted to
state the interests served by it.181 Commonly mentioned in numer-
ous cases was the assertion that the privilege was designed to pro-
tect the innocent and to further the search for truth.182
    It appears now, however, that the Court has rejected both of
these as inapplicable and has settled upon the principle that the
clause serves two interrelated interests: the preservation of an ac-
cusatorial system of criminal justice, which goes to the integrity of
the judicial system, and the preservation of personal privacy from

     181 “It reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our

unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-
accusation, perjury or contempt; our preference for an accusatorial rather than an
inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements
will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which
dictates ‘a fair state-individual balance by requiring the government to leave the
individual alone until good cause is shown for disturbing him and by requiring the
government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load’; our re-
spect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each indi-
vidual ‘to a private enclave where he may lead a private life’; our distrust of self-
deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes ‘a
shelter to the guilty,’ is often ‘a protection to the innocent.’ ” Murphy v. Waterfront
