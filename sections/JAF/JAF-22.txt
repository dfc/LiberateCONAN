indictment was invalid or for some reason the trial’s results were
voidable, a judgment of acquittal must nevertheless remain undis-
turbed.104
     Acquittal by the Trial Judge.—When a trial judge acquits a
defendant, that action concludes the matter to the same extent that
acquittal by jury verdict does.105 There is no possibility of retrial
for the same offense.106 But it may be difficult at times to deter-
mine whether the trial judge’s action was in fact an acquittal or
whether it was a dismissal or some other action, which the prosecu-
tion may be able to appeal or the judge may be able to recon-
sider.107 The question is “whether the ruling of the judge, whatever
its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or
all of the factual elements of the offense charged.” 108 Thus, an ap-
peal by the government was held barred in a case in which the dead-
locked jury had been discharged, and the trial judge had granted
the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal under the appro-

gree murder lacked the necessary finality of an acquittal, and found that Double
Jeopardy did not bar a subsequent prosecution for those crimes. Three dissenting
Justices held that Double Jeopardy required a partial verdict of acquittal on the
greater offenses under the circumstances.
     In Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222 (1994), the Court ruled that a jury’s action in
leaving the verdict sheet blank on all but one count did not amount to an acquittal
on those counts, and that consequently conviction on the remaining count, alleged
to be duplicative of one of the blank counts, could not constitute double jeopardy. In
any event, the Court added, no successive prosecution violative of double jeopardy
could result from an initial sentencing proceeding in the course of an initial prosecu-
tion.
     104 In United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896), three defendants were placed

on trial, Ball was acquitted and the other two were convicted, the two appealed and
obtained a reversal on the ground that the indictment had been defective, and all
three were again tried and all three were convicted. Ball’s conviction was set aside
as violating the clause; the trial court’s action was not void but only voidable, and
Ball had taken no steps to void it while the government could not take such action.
Similarly, in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), the defendant was convicted
of burglary but acquitted of larceny; the conviction was set aside on his appeal be-
cause the jury had been unconstitutionally chosen. He was again tried and con-
victed of both burglary and larceny, but the larceny conviction was held to violate
the Double Jeopardy Clause. On the doctrine of “constructive acquittals” by convic-
tion of a lesser included offense, see discussion infra under “Reprosecution After Re-
versal on Defendant’s Appeal.”
     105 United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 570–72 (1977); Sanabria

v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 63–65 (1978); Finch v. United States, 433 U.S. 676
(1977).
     106 In Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962), the Court acknowledged

that the trial judge’s action in acquitting was “based upon an egregiously erroneous
foundation,” but it was nonetheless final and could not be reviewed. Id. at 143.
     107 As a general rule a state may prescribe that a judge’s midtrial determina-

tion of the sufficiency of the prosecution’s proof may be reconsidered. Smith v. Mas-
sachusetts, 543 U.S. 462 (2005) (Massachusetts had not done so, however, so the
judge’s midtrial acquittal on one of three counts became final for double jeopardy
purposes when the prosecution rested its case).
