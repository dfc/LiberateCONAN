ownership that extinguishment of this right ordinarily constitutes
a taking.750 Similarly valued is the right to pass on property to one’s
heirs.751
     Failure to incur administrative (and judicial) delays can result
in dismissal of an as-applied taking claim based on ripeness doc-
trine, an area of takings law that the Court has developed exten-
sively since Penn Central. In the leading decision of Williamson County
Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank,752 the Court an-
nounced the canonical two-part ripeness test for takings actions
brought in federal court. First, for an as-applied challenge, the prop-
erty owner must obtain from the regulating agency a “final, defini-
tive position” regarding how it will apply its regulation to the own-
er’s land. Second, when suing a state or municipality, the owner
must exhaust any possibilities for obtaining compensation from the
state or its courts before coming to federal court. Thus, the claim
in Williamson County was found unripe because the plaintiff had
failed to seek a variance (first prong of test), and had not sought
compensation from the state courts in question even though they
recognized inverse condemnation claims (second prong). Similarly,
in MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. County of Yolo,753 a final deci-
sion was found lacking where the landowner had been denied ap-
proval for one subdivision plan calling for intense development, but
that denial had not foreclosed the possibility that a scaled-down
(though still economic) version would be approved. In a somewhat
different context, a taking challenge to a municipal rent control or-
dinance was considered “premature” in the absence of evidence that
a tenant hardship provision had ever been applied to reduce what
would otherwise be considered a reasonable rent increase.754 Begin-
ning with Lucas in 1992, however, the Court’s ripeness determina-
tions have displayed an impatience with formalistic reliance on the
“final decision” rule, while nonetheless explicitly reaffirming it. In
     750 Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825, 831–32 (1987) (physical

occupation occurs with public easement that eliminates right to exclude others); Kai-
ser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979) (imposition of navigation servitude
requiring public access to a privately-owned pond was a taking under the circum-
stances; owner’s commercially valuable right to exclude others was taken, and re-
quirement amounted to “an actual physical invasion”). But see PruneYard Shopping
Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 84 (1980) (requiring shopping center to permit indi-
viduals to exercise free expression rights on property onto which public had been
invited was not destructive of right to exclude others or “so essential to the use or
economic value of [the] property” as to constitute a taking).
     751 Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987) (complete abrogation of the right to pass

on to heirs fractionated interests in lands constitutes a taking), Babbitt v. Youpee,
519 U.S. 234 (1997) (same result based on “severe” restriction of the right).
     752 473 U.S. 172 (1985).
     753 477 U.S. 340 (1986).
     754 Pennell v. City of San Jose, 485 U.S. 1 (1988).
