The modern conception of public use equates it with the police power
in the furtherance of the public interest. No definition of the reach
or limits of the power is possible, the Court has said, because such
“definition is essentially the product of legislative determinations
addressed to the purposes of government, purposes neither ab-
stractly nor historically capable of complete definition. . . . Public
safety, public health, morality, peace and quiet, law and order—
these are some of the . . . traditional application[s] of the police power
. . . .” Effectuation of these matters being within the authority of
the legislature, the power to achieve them through the exercise of
eminent domain is established. “For the power of eminent domain
is merely the means to the end.” 606 Subsequently, the Court put
forward an added indicium of “public use”: whether the govern-
ment purpose could be validly achieved by tax or user fee.607 Tradi-
tionally, eminent domain has been used to facilitate transportation,
the supplying of water, and the like,608 but the use of the power to
establish public parks, to preserve places of historic interest, and
to promote beautification has substantial precedent.609

public utility); Dohany v. Rogers, 281 U.S. 362 (1930) (land taken for purpose of
exchange with a railroad company for a portion of its right-of-way required for wid-
ening a highway); Delaware, L. & W.R.R. v. Town of Morristown, 276 U.S. 182 (1928)
(establishment by a municipality of a public hack stand upon driveway maintained
by railroad upon its own terminal grounds to afford ingress and egress to its pa-
trons); Clark v. Nash, 198 U.S. 361 (1905) (right-of-way across neighbor’s land to
enlarge irrigation ditch for water without which land would remain valueless); Strickley
v. Highland Boy Mining Co., 200 U.S. 527 (1906) (right of way across a placer min-
ing claim for aerial bucket line). In Missouri Pacific Ry. v. Nebraska, 164 U.S. 403
(1896), however, the Court held that it was an invalid use when a State attempted
to compel, on payment of compensation, a railroad, which had permitted the erec-
tion of two grain elevators by private citizens on its right-of-way, to grant upon like
terms a location to another group of farmers to erect a third grain elevator for their
own benefit.

lic park in District of Columbia); Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 U.S. 700
(1923) (scenic highway); Brown v. United States, 263 U.S. 78 (1923) (condemnation
of property near town flooded by establishment of reservoir in order to locate a new
townsite, even though there might be some surplus lots to be sold); United States v.
Gettysburg Electric Ry., 160 U.S. 668 (1896), and Roe v. Kansas ex rel. Smith, 278
U.S. 191 (1929) (historic sites). When time is deemed to be of the essence, Congress
takes land directly by statute, authorizing procedures by which owners of appropri-
ated land may obtain just compensation. See, e.g., Pub. L. 90–545, § 3, 82 Stat. 931
