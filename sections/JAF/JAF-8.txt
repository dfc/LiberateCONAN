gress has classified the offense.26 An act punishable by a fine of not
more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than six months is
a misdemeanor, which can be tried without indictment, even though
the punishment exceeds that specified in the statutory definition of
“petty offenses.” 27
    A person can be tried only upon the indictment as found by the
grand jury, and especially upon its language found in the charging
part of the instrument.28 A change in the indictment that does not
narrow its scope deprives the court of the power to try the ac-
cused.29 Although additions to offenses alleged in an indictment are
prohibited, the Court has now ruled that it is permissible “to drop
from an indictment those allegations that are unnecessary to an
offense that is clearly contained within it,” as, for example, a lesser
included offense.30 There being no constitutional requirement that
an indictment be presented by a grand jury in a body, an indict-
ment delivered by the foreman in the absence of other grand jurors
is valid.31 If valid on its face, an indictment returned by a legally
constituted, non-biased grand jury satisfies the requirement of the
Fifth Amendment and is enough to call for a trial on the merits; it
is not open to challenge on the ground that there was inadequate
or incompetent evidence before the grand jury.32
    The protection of indictment by grand jury extends to all per-
sons except those serving in the armed forces. All persons in the
regular armed forces are subject to court martial rather than grand
jury indictment or trial by jury.33 The exception’s limiting words “when
in actual service in time of war or public danger” apply only to mem-

     28 See Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212 (1960), which held that a variation

between pleading and proof deprived petitioner of his right to be tried only upon
charges presented in the indictment.
     29 Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 12 (1887). Ex parte Bain was overruled in United

States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (1985), to the extent that it held that a narrowing of
an indictment is impermissible. Ex parte Bain was also overruled to the extent that
it held that it held that a defective indictment was not just substantive error, but
that it deprived a court of subject-matter jurisdiction over a case. United States v.
Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002). While a defendant’s failure to challenge an error of
substantive law at trial level may result in waiver of such issue for purpose of ap-
peal, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction may be made at any time. Thus, where
a defendant failed to assert his right to a non-defective grand jury indictment, ap-
pellate review of the matter would limited to a “plain error” analysis. 535 U.S. at
