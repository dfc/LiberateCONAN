ney.369 The Court recognized that “other fully effective means” could
be devised to convey the right to remain silent,370 but it was firm
that the prosecution was not permitted to show that an unwarned
suspect knew of his rights in some manner.371 Nevertheless, it is
not necessary that the police give the warnings as a verbatim re-
cital of the words in the Miranda opinion itself, so long as the words
used “fully conveyed” to a defendant his rights.372
     Fourth, once a warned suspect asserts his right to silence and
requests counsel, the police must scrupulously respect his assertion
of right. The Miranda Court strongly stated that once a warned
suspect “indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during
questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must
cease.” Further, if the suspect indicates he wishes the assistance of
counsel during interrogation, questioning must cease until he has
counsel.373
     That said, the Court has issued a distinct line of cases on the
right to counsel that has created practically a per se rule barring
the police from continuing or from reinitiating interrogation with a
suspect requesting counsel until counsel is present, save only that
the suspect himself may initiate further proceedings. In Edwards
v. Arizona,374 initial questioning had ceased as soon as the suspect
had requested counsel, and the suspect had been returned to his
cell. Questioning had resumed the following day only after differ-
ent police officers had confronted the suspect and again warned him
of his rights; the suspect agreed to talk and thereafter incrimi-

     372 California v. Prysock, 453 U.S. 355 (1981). Rephrased, the test is whether

the warnings “reasonably conveyed” a suspect’s rights, the Court adding that review-
ing courts “need not examine Miranda warnings as if construing a will or defining
the terms of an easement.” Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U.S. 195, 203 (1989) (uphold-
ing warning that included possibly misleading statement that a lawyer would be
appointed “if and when you go to court”). Even where warnings were not the “clear-
est possible formulation of Miranda’s right-to-counsel advisement,” the Court found
them acceptable as “sufficiently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a
commonsense reading.” Florida v. Powell, 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–1175, slip op. at 12
(2010) (emphasis in original) (upholding warning of a right to talk to a lawyer be-
fore answering any questions, coupled with advice that the right could be invoked
at any time during police questioning, as adequate to inform a suspect of his right
to have a lawyer present during questioning).
     373 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 472, 473–74 (1966). While a request for a

lawyer is a per se invocation of Fifth Amendment rights, a request for another advi-
sor, such as a probation officer or family member, may be taken into account in de-
termining whether a suspect has evidenced an intent to claim his right to remain
silent. Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707 (1979) (juvenile who requested to see his
probation officer, rather than counsel, found under the totality-of-the-circumstances
to have not invoked a right to remain silent).
