accepted by the House for referral to the states, the present lan-
guage of the clause was inserted.45
    Throughout most of its history, this clause was binding only against
the Federal Government. In Palko v. Connecticut,46 the Court re-
jected an argument that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated
all the provisions of the first eight Amendments as limitations on
the states and enunciated the due process theory under which most
of those Amendments do now apply to the states. Some guarantees
in the Bill of Rights, Justice Cardozo wrote, were so fundamental
that they are “of the very essence of the scheme of ordered liberty”
and “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacri-
ficed.” 47 But the Double Jeopardy Clause, like many other proce-
dural rights of defendants, was not so fundamental; it could be ab-
sent and fair trials could still be had. Of course, a defendant’s due
process rights, absent double jeopardy consideration per se, might
be violated if the state “creat[ed] a hardship so acute and shocking
as to be unendurable,” but that was not the case in Palko.48 In Benton
v. Maryland, however, the Court concluded “that the double jeop-
ardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental
ideal in our constitutional heritage. . . . Once it is decided that a
particular Bill of Rights guarantee is ‘fundamental to the Ameri-
can scheme of justice,’ the same constitutional standards apply against
both the State and Federal Governments.” 49 Therefore, the double
jeopardy limitation now applies to both federal and state govern-
ments and state rules on double jeopardy, with regard to such mat-
ters as when jeopardy attaches, must be considered in the light of
federal standards.50
     In a federal system, different units of government 51 may have
different interests to serve in the definition of crimes and the en-
forcement of their laws, and where the different units have overlap-
ping jurisdictions a person may engage in conduct that will violate

In Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 40 (1978) (dissenting), Justice Powell attributed to
inadvertence the broadening of the “rubric” of double jeopardy to incorporate the
common law rule against dismissal of the jury prior to verdict, a question the major-
ity passed over as being “of academic interest only.” Id. at 34 n.10.
