proceedings, with the result that a witness called before a grand
jury may be questioned on the basis of knowledge obtained through
the use of illegally seized evidence.6 In thus allowing the use of evi-
dence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Court
nonetheless restated the principle that, although free of many rules
of evidence that bind trial courts, grand juries are not unre-
strained by constitutional consideration.7 A witness called before a
grand jury is not entitled to be informed that he may be indicted



emphasizing the point of institution of criminal proceedings, relevant to the right of
counsel at line-ups and the like, the Chief Justice not only reasserted the absence
of a right to counsel in the room but also, despite his having referred to it, cast
doubt upon the existence of any constitutional requirement that a grand jury wit-
ness be permitted to consult with counsel out of the room, and, further, raised the
implication that a witness or putative defendant unable to afford counsel would have
no right to appointed counsel. Concurring, Justice Brennan argued that access to
counsel was essential and constitutionally required for the protection of constitu-
tional rights; Brennan accepted the likelihood, without agreeing, that consultation
outside the room would be adequate to preserve a witness’ rights, id. at 602–09 (with
Justice Marshall). Justices Stewart and Blackmun reserved judgment. Id. at 609.
The dispute appears ripe for revisiting.
     6 United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974). The Court has interpreted a

provision of federal wiretap law, 18 U.S.C. § 2515, to prohibit use of unlawful wire-
tap information as a basis for questioning witnesses before grand juries. Gelbard v.
United States, 408 U.S. 41 (1972).
     7 “Of course, the grand jury’s subpoena power is not unlimited. It may consider

incompetent evidence, but it may not itself violate a valid privilege, whether estab-
lished by the Constitution, statutes, or the common law. . . . Although, for example,
an indictment based on evidence obtained in violation of a defendant’s Fifth Amend-
ment privilege is nevertheless valid . . . , the grand jury may not force a witness to
answer questions in violation of that constitutional guarantee. . . . Similarly, a grand
jury may not compel a person to produce books and papers that would incriminate
him. . . . The grand jury is also without power to invade a legitimate privacy inter-
est protected by the Fourth Amendment. A grand jury’s subpoena duces tecum will
be disallowed if it is ‘far too sweeping in its terms to be regarded as reasonable’
under the Fourth Amendment. Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76 (1906). Judicial su-
pervision is properly exercised in such cases to prevent the wrong before it occurs.”
United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 346 (1974). See also United States v. Dionisio,
410 U.S. 1, 11–12 (1973). Grand juries must operate within the limits of the First
Amendment and may not harass the exercise of speech and press rights. Branzburg
v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 707–08 (1972). Protection of Fourth Amendment interests is
as extensive before the grand jury as before any investigative officers, Silverthorne
Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76–77
(1906), but not more so either. United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1 (1973) (sub-
poena to give voice exemplars); United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19 (1973) (handwrit-
ing exemplars). The Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination Clause must be re-
spected. Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 159 (1950); Hoffman v. United States, 341
U.S. 479 (1951). On common-law privileges, see Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 332
(1951) (husband-wife privilege); Alexander v. United States, 138 U.S. 353 (1891)
(attorney-client privilege). The traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings has been
relaxed a degree to permit a limited discovery of testimony. Compare Pittsburgh Plate
Glass Co. v. United States, 360 U.S. 395 (1959), with Dennis v. United States, 384
U.S. 855 (1966). See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) (secrecy requirements and exceptions).
