they are not reflected in the market value of the property taken.652
“Whatever of property the citizen has the government may take.
When it takes the property, that is, the fee, the lease, whatever, he
may own, terminating altogether his interest, under the estab-
lished law it must pay him for what is taken, not more; and he
must stand whatever indirect or remote injuries are properly com-
prehended within the meaning of ‘consequential damage’ as that con-
ception has been defined in such cases. Even so the consequences
often are harsh. For these whatever remedy may exist lies with Con-
gress.” 653 An exception to the general principle has been estab-
lished by the Court where only a temporary occupancy is assumed;
then the taking body must pay the value which a hypothetical long-
term tenant in possession would require when leasing to a tempo-
rary occupier requiring his removal, including in the market value
of the interest the reasonable cost of moving out the personal prop-
erty stored in the premises, the cost of storage of goods against their
sale, and the cost of returning the property to the premises.654 An-
other exception to the general rule occurs with a partial taking, in
which the government takes less than the entire parcel of land and
leaves the owner with a portion of what he had before; in such a
case compensation includes any diminished value of the remaining
portion (“severance damages”) as well as the value of the taken por-
tion.655

     654 United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373 (1945). In Kimball Laun-

dry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1 (1949), the Government seized the tenant’s plant
for the duration of the war, which turned out to be less than the full duration of the
lease, and, having no other means of serving its customers, the laundry suspended
business for the period of military occupancy; the Court narrowly held that the gov-
ernment must compensate for the loss in value of the business attributable to the
destruction of its “trade routes,” that is, for the loss of customers built up over the
years and for the continued hold of the laundry upon their patronage. See also United
States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 114 (1951) (in temporary seizure, Government
must compensate for losses attributable to increased wage payments by the Govern-
ment).

the Court added, “if the taking has in fact benefitted the remainder, the benefit may
be set off against the value of the land taken.” Id.
