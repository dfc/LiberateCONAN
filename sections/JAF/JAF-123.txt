the dikes around his land to prevent their partial flooding conse-
quent to private construction of a dam under public licensing.670
     But the Court also decided long ago that land can be “taken” in
the constitutional sense by physical invasion or occupation by the
government, as occurs when government floods land permanently
or recurrently.671 A later formulation was that “[p]roperty is taken
in the constitutional sense when inroads are made upon an own-
er’s use of it to an extent that, as between private parties, a servi-
tude has been acquired either by agreement or in course of time.” 672
It was thus held that the government had imposed a servitude for
which it must compensate the owner on land adjoining its fort when
it repeatedly fired the guns at the fort across the land and had es-
tablished a fire control service there.673 In two major cases, the Court
held that the lessees or operators of airports were required to com-
pensate the owners of adjacent land when the noise, glare, and fear
of injury occasioned by the low altitude overflights during takeoffs
and landings made the land unfit for the use to which the owners
had applied it.674 Eventually, the term “inverse condemnation” came
to be used to refer to such cases where the government has not
instituted formal condemnation proceedings, but instead the prop-
erty owner has sued for just compensation, claiming that govern-
mental action or regulation has “taken” his property.675

a government defendant in which a landowner may recover just compensation for a

been instituted by the government entity.” San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. City of
