tion in the trial process.68 Others have expressed the view that the
clause not only protects the integrity of final judgments but, more
important, that it protects the accused against the strain and bur-
den of multiple trials, which would also enhance the ability of gov-
ernment to convict.69 Still other Justices have engaged in a form of
balancing of defendants’ rights with society’s rights to determine when
reprosecution should be permitted when a trial ends prior to a fi-
nal judgment not hinged on the defendant’s culpability.70 Thus, the
basic area of disagreement, though far from the only one, centers
on the trial from the attachment of jeopardy to the final judgment.

Reprosecution Following Mistrial
    The common law generally required that the previous trial must
have ended in a judgment, of conviction or acquittal, but the consti-
tutional rule is that jeopardy attaches much earlier, in jury trials
when the jury is sworn, and in trials before a judge without a jury,
when the first evidence is presented.71 Therefore, if after jeopardy
attaches the trial is terminated for some reason, it may be that a

     68 See Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 40 (1978) (dissenting opinion). Justice Powell,

joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, argued that, with the Double
Jeopardy Clause so interpreted, the Due Process Clause could be relied on to pre-
vent prosecutorial abuse during the trial designed to abort the trial and obtain a
second one. Id. at 50. All three have joined, indeed, in some instances, have au-
thored, opinions adverting to the role of the double jeopardy clause in protecting
against such prosecutorial abuse. E.g., United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 92–94
(1978); Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982) (but narrowing scope of concept).
     69 United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 101 (1978) (dissenting opinion) (Justices

Brennan, White, Marshall, and Stevens).
     70 Thus, Justice Blackmun has enunciated positions recognizing a broad right

of defendants much like the position of the latter three Justices, Crist v. Bretz, 437
U.S. 28, 38 (1978) (concurring), and he joined Justice Stevens’ concurrence in Or-
egon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 681 (1982), but he also joined the opinions in United
States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978), and Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497 (1978)
(Justice Blackmun concurring only in the result).
     71 The rule traces back to United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 (1824).

See also Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100 (1904); Downum v. United States,
372 U.S. 734 (1963) (trial terminated just after jury sworn but before any testimony
taken). In Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28 (1978), the Court held this standard of the
attachment of jeopardy was “at the core” of the clause and it therefore binds the
States. But see id. at 40 (Justice Powell dissenting). An accused is not put in jeop-
ardy by preliminary examination and discharge by the examining magistrate, Col-
lins v. Loisel, 262 U.S. 426 (1923), by an indictment which is quashed, Taylor v.
United States, 207 U.S. 120, 127 (1907), or by arraignment and pleading to the in-
dictment. Bassing v. Cady, 208 U.S. 386, 391–92 (1908). A defendant may be tried
after preliminary proceedings that present no risk of final conviction. E.g., Ludwig
v. Massachusetts, 427 U.S. 618, 630–32 (1976) (conviction in prior summary proceed-
ing does not foreclose trial in a court of general jurisdiction, where defendant has
absolute right to demand a trial de novo and thus set aside the first conviction);
Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204 (1978) (double jeopardy not violated by procedure
under which masters hear evidence and make preliminary recommendations to ju-
venile court judge, who may confirm, modify, or remand).
