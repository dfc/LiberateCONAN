nied by governmental possession and use or a forced sale of the fa-
cility, was not a taking entitling the owner to compensation for loss
of profits. Finally, the Court held that when federal troops occupied
several buildings during a riot in order to dislodge rioters and loot-
ers who had already invaded the buildings, the action was taken
as much for the owners’ benefit as for the general public benefit
and the owners must bear the costs of the damage inflicted on the
buildings subsequent to the occupation.731
    The first prong of the Agins test,732 asking whether land use
controls “substantially advance legitimate governmental interests,”
has now been erased from takings jurisprudence, after a quarter-
century run. The proper concern of regulatory takings law, said Lingle
v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,733 is the magnitude, character, and distribu-
tion of the burdens that a regulation imposes on property rights.
In “stark contrast,” the “substantially advances” test addresses the
means-end efficacy of a regulation, more in the nature of a due pro-
cess inquiry.734 As such, it is not a valid takings test.
   A third type of inverse condemnation, in addition to regulatory
and physical takings, is the exaction taking. A two-part test has
emerged. The first part debuted in Nollan v. California Coastal Com-
mission,735 and holds that in order not to be a taking, an exaction
condition on a development permit approval (requiring, for ex-
ample, that a portion of a tract to be subdivided be dedicated for
public roads) 736 must substantially advance a purpose related to the
underlying permit. There must, in short, be an “essential nexus”
between the two; otherwise the condition is “an out-and-out plan of

     731 National Bd. of YMCA v. United States, 395 U.S. 85 (1969). “An undertaking

by the government to reduce the menace from flood damages which were inevitable
but for the Government’s work does not constitute the Government a taker of all
lands not fully and wholly protected. When undertaking to safeguard a large area
from existing flood hazards, the government does not owe compensation under the
Fifth Amendment to every landowner which it fails to or cannot protect.” United
States v. Sponenbarger, 308 U.S. 256, 265 (1939).

     735 483 U.S. 825 (1987).
     736 Nollan also applies to exactions imposed as conditions precedent to permit

approval. Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, 570 U.S. ___, No.
11–1447 (2013). To the argument that nothing is “taken” when a permit is denied
for failure to agree to a condition precedent, Justice Alito stated that what is at
stake is not whether a taking has occurred, but whether the right not to have prop-
erty taken without just compensation has been burdened impermissibly. Id. at 10.
The Court does not discuss what remedies might be available to a plaintiff who re-
fuses to accept excessively demanding conditions precedent and thereby is refused a
permit.
