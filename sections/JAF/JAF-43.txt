and probationers 209 have less protection than others do, the Court
has not developed a clear doctrinal explanation to identify the dif-
ferences between permissible and impermissible coercion.210
    It has long been the rule that a defendant who takes the stand
on his own behalf does so voluntarily, and cannot then claim the
privilege to defeat cross-examination on matters reasonably related
to the subject matter of his direct examination,211 and that such a
defendant may be impeached by proof of prior convictions.212 But,
in Griffin v. California,213 the Court refused to permit prosecutorial
or judicial comment to the jury upon a defendant’s refusal to take
the stand on his own behalf, because such comment was a “penalty
imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege” and “[i]t
cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.” 214 Pros-
ecutors’ comments violating the Griffin rule can nonetheless consti-
tute harmless error.215 Nor may a prosecutor impeach a defen-
dant’s trial testimony through use of the fact that upon his arrest

ships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” 536 U.S. at 38 (opinion of
Justice Kennedy). Concurring Justice O’Connor stated her belief that the “minor”
change in living conditions seemed “very unlikely to actually compel [the prisoner]
to [participate].” Id. at 51.
     208 See, in addition to McKune v. Lile, Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976)

(adverse inference from inmate’s silence at prison disciplinary hearing); and Ohio
Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 286 (1998) (adverse inference from
inmate’s silence at clemency hearing).
     209 Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984) (the possibility of revocation of

probation was not so coercive as to compel a probationer to provide incriminating
answers to probation officer’s questions).
     210 The Court in McKune v. Lile split 5-to-4, with no opinion of the Court.
     211 Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 597–98 (1896); Fitzpatrick v. United States,

178 U.S. 304, 314–16 (1900); Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148 (1958). See also
Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 286 (1998) (testimony at a clem-
ency interview is voluntary, and cannot be compelled).
     212 Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 561 (1967); cf. Michelson v. United States,

335 U.S. 469 (1948).
     213 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965). The result had been achieved in federal court through

statutory enactment. 18 U.S.C. § 3481. See Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60 (1893).
In Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288 (1981), the Court held that the Self-
Incrimination Clause required a state, upon defendant’s request, to give a caution-
ary instruction to the jurors that they must disregard defendant’s failure to testify
and not draw any adverse inferences from it. This result, too, had been accom-
plished in the federal courts through statutory construction. Bruno v. United States,
308 U.S. 287 (1939). In Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U.S. 333 (1978), the Court held
that a court may give such an instruction, even over defendant’s objection. Carter v.
Kentucky was applied in James v. Kentucky, 466 U.S. 341 (1983) (request for jury
“admonition” sufficient to invoke right to “instruction”).
     214 Although the Griffin rule continues to apply when the prosecutor on his own

initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence, it
does not apply to a prosecutor’s “fair response” to a defense counsel’s allegation that
the government had denied his client the opportunity to explain his actions. United
States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 32 (1988).
     215 Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967); United States v. Hasting, 461

U.S. 499 (1983).
