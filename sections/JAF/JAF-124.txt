improvement to a river’s navigable capacity, or from an improve-
ment on a nonnavigable river designed to affect navigability else-
where, it is generally not a taking of property but merely an exer-
cise of a servitude to which the property is always subject.676 This
exception does not apply to lands above the ordinary high-water mark
of a stream,677 hence is inapplicable to the damage the government
may do to such “fast lands” by causing overflows, by erosion, and
otherwise, consequent on erection of dams or other improve-
ments.678 And, when previously nonnavigable waters are made navi-
gable by private investment, government may not, without paying
compensation, simply assert a navigation servitude and direct the
property owners to afford public access.679
     Regulatory Takings.—Although it is established that govern-
ment may take private property, with compensation, to promote the
public interest, that interest also may be served by regulation of
property use pursuant to the police power, and for years there was
broad dicta that no one may claim damages that result from a po-
lice regulation designed to secure the common welfare, especially
in the area of health and safety.680 “What distinguishes eminent do-
main from the police power is that the former involves the taking
of property because of its need for the public use while the latter
involves the regulation of such property to prevent the use thereof
in a manner that is detrimental to the public interest.” 681 But regu-
lation may deprive an owner of most or all beneficial use of his prop-
erty and may destroy the values of the property for the purposes to
which it is suited.682 The older cases flatly denied the possibility of
