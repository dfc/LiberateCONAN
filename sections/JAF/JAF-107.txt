rized retrospective impairment of contractual obligations,563 but the
Due Process Clause (by itself or infused with takings principles) con-
stitutes a limitation upon Congress’s power to deprive persons of
more secure forms of property, such as the rights secured creditors
have to obtain repayment of a debt. The Court had long followed a
rule of construction favoring prospective-only application of bank-
ruptcy laws, absent a clear showing of congressional intent,564 but
it was not until 1935 that the Court actually held unconstitutional
a retrospective law. Struck down by the Court was the Frazier-
Lemke Act, which by its terms applied only retrospectively, and which
authorized a court to stay proceedings for the foreclosure of a mort-
gage for five years, the debtor to remain in possession at a reason-
able rental, with the option of purchasing the property at its ap-
praised value at the end of the stay. The Act offended the Fifth
Amendment, the Court held, because it deprived the creditor of sub-
stantial property rights acquired prior to the passage of the act.565
However, a modified law, under which the stay was subject to ter-
mination by the court and which continued the right of the credi-
tor to have the property sold to pay the debt, was sustained.566
    The sale of collateral under the terms of a contract may be en-
joined without violating the Due Process Clause, if such sale would
hinder the preparation or consummation of a proposed railroad re-
organization, provided the injunction does no more than delay the
enforcement of the contract.567 A provision that claims resulting from
rejection of an unexpired lease should be treated as on a parity with
provable debts, but limited to an amount equal to three years rent,
was held not to amount to a taking of property without due pro-
cess of law, since it provided a new and more certain remedy for a
limited amount, in lieu of an existing remedy inefficient and uncer-
tain in result.568 A right of redemption allowed by state law upon

subsequently the Court interpreted the statute so as to make smaller the modifica-
tions, John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, 308 U.S. 180, 184 & n.3 (1939);

survived Vinton Branch).
