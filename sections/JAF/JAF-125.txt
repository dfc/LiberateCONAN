compensation for this diminution of property values,683 but the Court
in 1922 established as a general principle that “if regulation goes
too far it will be recognized as a taking.” 684
    In Mahon, Justice Holmes, for the Court, over Justice Brandeis’
vigorous dissent, held unconstitutional a state statute prohibiting
subsurface mining in regions where it presented a danger of subsid-
ence for homeowners. The homeowners had purchased by deeds that
reserved to the coal companies ownership of subsurface mining rights
and that held the companies harmless for damage caused by sub-
surface mining operations. The statute thus gave the homeowners
more than they had been able to obtain through contracting, and
at the same time deprived the coal companies of the entire value of
their subsurface estates. The Court observed that “[f]or practical pur-
poses, the right to coal consists in the right to mine,” and that the
statute, by making it “commercially impracticable to mine certain
coal,” had essentially “the same effect for constitutional purposes
as appropriating or destroying it.” 685 The regulation, therefore, in
precluding the companies from exercising any mining rights what-
ever, went “too far.” 686 However, when presented 65 years later with
a very similar restriction on coal mining, the Court upheld it, point-
ing out that, unlike its predecessor, the newer law identified impor-
tant public interests.687
    The Court had been early concerned with the imposition upon
one or a few individuals of the costs of furthering the public inter-
est.688 But it was with respect to zoning, in the context of substan-
tive due process, that the Court first experienced some difficulty in
loss of red cedar trees ordered destroyed because they were infected with rust that
threatened contamination of neighboring apple orchards: preferment of public inter-
est in saving cash crop to property interest in ornamental trees was rational).

South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992) (a regulation that deprives a
property owner of all beneficial use of his property requires compensation, unless
the owner’s proposed use is one prohibited by background principles of property or
nuisance law existing at the time the property was acquired).
     685 260 U.S. at 414–15.
     686 260 U.S. at 415. In dissent, Justice Brandeis argued that a restriction im-

posed to abridge the owner’s exercise of his rights in order to prohibit a noxious use
or to protect the public health and safety simply could not be a taking, because the
owner retained his interest and his possession. Id. at 416.
