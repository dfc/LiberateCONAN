the State that its use by anyone, for certain forbidden purposes, is
prejudicial to the public interests.” 714 In Penn Central, however, the
Court denied that there was any such test and that prior cases had
turned on the concept. “These cases are better understood as rest-
ing not on any supposed ‘noxious’ quality of the prohibited uses but
rather on the ground that the restrictions were reasonably related
to the implementation of a policy—not unlike historic preservation—
expected to produce a widespread public benefit and applicable to
all similarly situated property.” 715 More recently, in Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council,716 the Court explained “noxious use” analy-
sis as merely an early characterization of police power measures
that do not require compensation. “[N]oxious use logic cannot serve
as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory ‘takings’—which require
compensation—from regulatory deprivations that do not require com-
pensation.” 717
    Penn Central is not the only guide to when an inverse condem-
nation has occurred; other criteria have emerged from other cases
before and after Penn Central. The Court has long recognized a per
se takings rule for certain physical invasions: when government per-
manently 718 occupies property (or authorizes someone else to do so),
the action constitutes a taking regardless of the public interests served
or the extent of damage to the parcel as a whole.719 The modern
case dealt with a law that required landlords to permit a cable tele-
vision company to install its cable facilities upon their buildings;
although the equipment occupied only about 1½ cubic feet of space
     714 369 U.S. at 593 (quoting Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 668–69 (1887)).

The Court posited a two-part test. First, the interests of the public required the in-
terference, and, second, the means were reasonably necessary for the accomplish-
ment of the purpose and were not unduly oppressive of the individual. 369 U.S. at
595. The test was derived from Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 137 (1894) (holding
that state officers properly destroyed fish nets that were banned by state law in
order to preserve certain fisheries from extinction).
     715 Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 133–34 n.30.
     716 505 U.S. 1003 (1992).
     717 505 U.S. at 1026. The Penn Central majority also rejected the dissent’s con-

tention, 438 U.S. at 147–50, that regulation of property use constitutes a taking
unless it spreads its distribution of benefits and burdens broadly so that each per-
son burdened has at the same time the enjoyment of the benefit of the restraint
upon his neighbors. The Court deemed it immaterial that the landmarks law has a
more severe impact on some landowners than on others: “Legislation designed to
promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others.” Id. at 133–
34.
     718 By contrast, the per se rule is inapplicable to temporary physical occupations

of land. Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 428, 434 (1982);
PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 84 (1980).
     719 The rule emerged from cases involving flooding of lands and erection of poles

for telegraph lines, e.g., Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 166 (1872);
City of St. Louis v. Western Union Tel. Co., 148 U.S. 92 (1893); Western Union Tel.
Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R., 195 U.S. 540 (1904).
