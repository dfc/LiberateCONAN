raignment could invalidate confessions, Congress in 1968 legis-
lated to set a six-hour period for interrogation following arrest be-
fore the suspect must be presented.293 In Corley v. United States,294
the Court held that this legislation merely limited, and did not elimi-
nate, McNabb-Mallory’s exclusionary rule. Thus, confessions within
six hours of arrest were admissible to the extent permitted by the
statute and Rules of Evidence, whereas, “[i]f the confession oc-
curred before presentment and beyond six hours . . . , the court must
decide whether delaying that long was unreasonable or unneces-
sary under the McNabb-Mallory cases, and if it was, the confession
is to be suppressed.” 295
     State Confession Cases Before Miranda.—In its first encoun-
ter with a confession case arising from a state court, the Supreme
Court set aside a conviction based solely on confessions extorted
through repeated whippings with ropes and studded belts.296 For
some 30 years thereafter the Court attempted through a consider-
ation of the “totality of the circumstances” surrounding interroga-
tion to determine whether a confession was “voluntary” and admis-
sible or “coerced” and inadmissible. During this time, the Court was
balancing, in Justice Frankfurter’s explication, a view that police
questioning of suspects was indispensable in solving many crimes,
on the one hand, with the conviction that the interrogation process
is not to be used to overreach persons who stand helpless before
it.297 “The ultimate test remains that which has been the only clearly
established test in Anglo-American courts for two hundred years:
the test of voluntariness. Is the confession the product of an essen-
tially free and unconstrained choice by its maker? If it is, if he has
willed to confess, it may be used against him. If it is not, if his will
has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination criti-
cally impaired, the use of his confession offends due process.” 298 Ob-
viously, a court seeking to determine whether a confession was vol-

of 1968, 82 Stat. 210, 18 U.S.C. § 3501(c).

     296 Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936). “[T]he question of the right of the

State to withdraw the privilege against self-incrimination is not here involved. The
compulsion to which the quoted statements refer is that of the processes of justice
by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify. Compul-
sion by torture to extort a confession is a different matter. . . . It would be difficult
to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to
procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions thus ob-
tained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due process.”
