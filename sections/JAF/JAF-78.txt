pense with the warnings and run the risk that resulting evidence
will be excluded at trial. While acknowledging that the exception
itself will “lessen the desirable clarity of the rule,” the Court pre-
dicted that confusion would be slight: “[w]e think that police offi-
cers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between ques-
tions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public
and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a
suspect.” 397 No such compelling justification was offered for a Miranda
exception for lesser offenses, however, and protecting the rule’s “sim-
plicity and clarity” counseled against creating one.398 “[A] person
subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the
procedural safeguards enunciated in Miranda, regardless of the na-
ture or severity of the offense of which he is suspected or for which
he was arrested.” 399

The Operation of the Exclusionary Rule
    Supreme Court Review.—The Court’s review of the question
of admissibility of confessions or other incriminating statements is
designed to prevent the foreclosure of the very question to be de-
cided by it, the issue of voluntariness under the due process stan-
dard, the issue of the giving of the requisite warnings and the sub-
sequent waiver, if there is one, under the Miranda rule. Recurring
to Justice Frankfurter’s description of the inquiry as a “three-
phased process” in due process cases at least,400 it can be seen that
the Court’s self-imposed rules of restraint on review of lower-court
factfinding greatly influenced the process. The finding of facts sur-
rounding the issue of coercion—the length of detention, circum-
stances of interrogation, use of violence or of tricks and ruses, et
cetera—is the proper function of the trial court which had the ad-
vantage of having the witnesses before it. “This means that all tes-
timonial conflict is settled by the judgment of the state courts. Where
they have made explicit findings of fact, those findings conclude us
and form the basis of our review—with the one caveat, necessarily,
that we are not to be bound by findings wholly lacking support in
evidence.” 401
