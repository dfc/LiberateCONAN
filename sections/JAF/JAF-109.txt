ening statutes of limitation, and the like, although these have typi-
cally arisen in state contexts. In one decision, the Court sustained
an award of additional compensation under the Longshoremen’s and
Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, made pursuant to a private act
of Congress passed after expiration of the period for review of the
original award, directing the Commission to review the case and
issue a new order, the challenge being made by the employer and
insurer.578
    Deprivation of Liberty: Economic Legislation.—The proscrip-
tion of deprivation of liberty without due process, insofar as sub-
stantive due process was involved, was long restricted to invoca-
tion against legislation deemed to abridge liberty of contract.579 The
two leading cases invalidating federal legislation, however, have both
been overruled, as the Court adopted a very restrained standard of
review of economic legislation.580 The Court’s hands-off policy with
regard to reviewing economic legislation is quite pronounced.581

               NATIONAL EMINENT DOMAIN POWER

Overview
    “The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says ‘nor shall pri-
vate property be taken for public use, without just compensation.’
This is a tacit recognition of a preexisting power to take private
property for public use, rather than a grant of new power.” 582 Emi-
nent domain “appertains to every independent government. It re-
quires no constitutional recognition; it is an attribute of sover-
eignty.” 583 In the early years of the nation the federal power of eminent
domain lay dormant as to property outside the District of Colum-
bia,584 and it was not until 1876 that its existence was recognized

     577 It is more likely with respect to congressional provision of a statutory substi-

tute for a cause of action arising directly out of a constitutional guarantee. E.g.,
Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18–23 (1980).
     578 Paramino Co. v. Marshall, 309 U.S. 370 (1940).
     579 See “Liberty of Contract” heading under Fourteenth Amendment, infra.
     580 Adair v. United States, 208 U.S. 161 (1908), overruled in substance by Phelps

Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177 (1941); Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U.S.
525 (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937).
     581 E.g., United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166 (1980);

Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221 (1981).
     582 United States v. Carmack, 329 U.S. 230, 241–42 (1946). The same is true of

“just compensation” clauses in state constitutions. Boom Co. v. Patterson, 98 U.S.
403, 406 (1879). For in-depth analysis of the eminent domain power, see 1 NICHOLS
ON EMINENT DOMAIN (Julius L. Sackman, 2006).
     583 Boom Co., 98 U.S. at 406.
     584 Prior to this time, the Federal Government pursued condemnation proceed-

ings in state courts and commonly relied on state law. Kohl v. United States, 91
U.S. 367, 373 (1876); United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. 513 (1883). The general statu-
