Process or Just Compensation Clauses as long as it serves the pub-
lic interest and the rates as a whole yield just compensation.517
     Occasionally, however, regulatory action has been held invalid
under the Due Process Clause. An order issued by the Interstate
Commerce Commission relieving short line railroads from the obli-
gation to pay the usual fixed sum per day rental for cars used on
foreign roads for a space of two days was held to be arbitrary and
invalid.518 A retirement act that made eligible for pensions all per-
sons who had been in the service of any railroad within one year
prior to the adoption of the law, counted past unconnected service
of an employee toward the requirement for a pension even if the
employee had contributed nothing to the pension fund, and treated
all carriers as a single employer and pooled their assets, without
regard to their individual obligations, was held unconstitutional.519
     Taxation.—In laying taxes, the Federal Government is less nar-
rowly restricted by the Fifth Amendment than are the states by the
Fourteenth. The Federal Government may tax property belonging
to its citizens, even if such property is never situated within the
jurisdiction of the United States,520 and it may tax the income of a
citizen resident abroad, which is derived from property located at
his residence.521 The difference is explained by the fact that protec-
tion of the Federal Government follows the citizen wherever he goes,
whereas the benefits of state government accrue only to persons and
property within the state’s borders. The Supreme Court has said
that, in the absence of an equal protection clause, “a claim of unrea-
sonable classification or inequality in the incidence or application
of a tax raises no question under the Fifth Amendment. . . .” 522 It
has sustained, over charges of unfair differentiation between per-
sons, a graduated income tax,523 a higher tax on oleomargarine than
on butter,524 an excise tax on “puts” but not on “call,” 525 a tax on
the income of business operated by corporations but not on similar
enterprises carried on by individuals,526 an income tax on foreign
corporations, based on their income from sources within the United
States, while domestic corporations were taxed on income from all
