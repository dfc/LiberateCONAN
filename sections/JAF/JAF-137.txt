    The process of describing general criteria to guide resolution of
regulatory taking claims, begun in Penn Central, has reduced to some
extent the ad hoc character of takings law. It is nonetheless true
that not all cases fit neatly into the categories delimited to date,
and that still other cases that might be so categorized are ex-
plained in different terms by the Court. The overriding objective,
the Court frequently reminds us, is to vitalize the Takings Clause’s
protection against government “forcing some people alone to bear
public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne
by the public as a whole.” 747 Thus a taking may be found if the
effect of regulation is enrichment of the government itself rather
than adjustment of the benefits and burdens of economic life in pro-
motion of the public good.748 Similarly, the Court looks askance at
governmental efforts to secure public benefits at a landowner’s ex-
pense—“government actions that may be characterized as acquisi-
tions of resources to permit or facilitate uniquely public func-
tions.” 749
    On the other side of the coin, the nature as well as the extent
of property interests affected by governmental regulation some-
times takes on importance. Some strands are more important than
others. The right to exclude others from one’s land is so basic to

of this fairness principle, see Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 123–24; and Tahoe-Sierra
Pres. Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 322, 333–42–89 (2002).
     748 Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155 (1980) (government

retained the interest derived from funds it required to be deposited with the clerk
of the county court as a precondition to certain suits; the interest earned was not
reasonably related to the costs of using the courts, since a separate statute required
payment for the clerk’s services). By contrast, a charge for governmental services
“not so clearly excessive as to belie [its] purported character as [a] user fee” does
not qualify as a taking. United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 62 (1989).
     749 Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 128 (1978). In

addition to the cases cited there, see also Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S.
164, 180 (1979) (viewed as governmental effort to turn private pond into “public aquatic
park”); Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987) (“extortion” of
beachfront easement for public as permit condition unrelated to purpose of permit).
