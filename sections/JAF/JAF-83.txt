cess in court, and therefore to be so limited that “due process of
law” would be what the legislative branch enacted it to be. But that
is not the interpretation which has been placed on the term. “It is
manifest that it was not left to the legislative power to enact any
process which might be devised. The article is a restraint on the
legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the
government, and cannot be so construed as to leave Congress free
to make any process ‘due process of law’ by its mere will.” 421 All
persons within the territory of the United States are entitled to its
protection, including corporations,422 aliens,423 and presumptively citi-
zens seeking readmission to the United States,424 but States as such
are not so entitled.425 It is effective in the District of Columbia 426
and in territories which are part of the United States,427 but it does
not apply of its own force to unincorporated territories.428 Nor does
it reach enemy alien belligerents tried by military tribunals out-
side the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.429
    Early in our judicial history, a number of jurists attempted to
formulate a theory of natural rights—natural justice, which would
limit the power of government, especially with regard to the prop-
erty rights of persons.430 State courts were the arenas in which this
struggle was carried out prior to the Civil War. Opposing the “vested
rights” theory of protection of property were jurists who argued first,
that the written constitution was the supreme law of the State and
that judicial review could look only to that document in scrutiniz-
ing legislation and not to the “unwritten law” of “natural rights,”
and second, that the “police power” of government enabled legisla-
tures to regulate the use and holding of property in the public in-

guarantees of procedural rights in criminal cases. 7 id. at 3813. New York in its
constitution of 1821 was the first state to pick up “due process of law” from the
United States Constitution. 5 id. at 2648.
