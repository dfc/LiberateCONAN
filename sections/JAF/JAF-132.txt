on the exterior of each building and had only a de minimis eco-
nomic impact, a divided Court held that the regulation authorized
a permanent physical occupation of the property and thus consti-
tuted a taking.720 Recently, the Court sharpened further the distinc-
tion between regulatory takings and permanent physical occupa-
tions by declaring it “inappropriate” to use case law from either realm
as controlling precedent in the other.721 Physical invasions falling
short of permanent physical occupations remain subject to Penn Cen-
tral.
     A second per se taking rule is of more recent vintage. Land use
controls constitute takings, the Court stated in Agins v. City of Tiburon,
if they do not “substantially advance legitimate governmental inter-
ests,” or if they deny a property owner “economically viable use of
his land.” 722 This second Agins criterion creates a categorical rule:
when, with respect to the parcel as a whole, the landowner “has
been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the
name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economi-
cally idle, he has suffered a taking.” 723 The only exceptions, the Court
explained in Lucas, are for those restrictions that come with the
property as title encumbrances or other legally enforceable limita-
tions. Regulations “so severe” as to prohibit all economically benefi-
cial use of land “cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without com-
pensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions
that background principles of the State’s law of property and nui-
sance already place upon land ownership. A law or decree with such
an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate the re-
     720 Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). Loretto

was distinguished in FCC v. Florida Power Corp., 480 U.S. 245 (1987); regulation of
the rates that utilities may charge cable companies for pole attachments does not
constitute a taking in the absence of any requirement that utilities allow attach-
ment and acquiesce in physical occupation of their property. See also Yee v. City of
Escondido, 503 U.S. 519 (1992) (no physical occupation was occasioned by regula-
tions in effect preventing mobile home park owners from setting rents or determin-
ing who their tenants would be; owners could still determine whether their land
would be used for a trailer park and could evict tenants in order to change the use
of their land).
     721 Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 323. Tahoe-Sierra’s sharp physical-regulatory di-

chotomy is hard to reconcile with dicta in Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S.
528, 539 (2005), to the effect that the Penn Central regulatory takings test, like the
physical occupations rule of Loretto, “aims to identify regulatory actions that are
functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropri-
ates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.”
     722 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980).
     723 Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1019 (1992) (empha-

sis in original). The Agins/Lucas total deprivation rule does not create an all-or-
nothing situation, since “the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of com-
plete” may still be able to recover through application of the Penn Central economic
impact and “distinct [or reasonable] investment-backed expectations” criteria. Id. at
1019 n.8 (1992). See also Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 632.
