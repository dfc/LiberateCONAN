tory rendition of this chapter in 1354. “No man of what state or
condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken,
nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to an-
swer by due process of law.” 416 Though Magna Carta was in es-
sence the result of a struggle over interest between the King and
his barons,417 this particular clause over time transcended any such
limitation of scope, and throughout the fourteenth century parlia-
mentary interpretation expanded far beyond the intention of any of
its drafters.418 The understanding which the founders of the Ameri-
can constitutional system, and those who wrote the Due Process
Clauses, brought to the subject they derived from Coke, who in his
Second Institutes expounded the proposition that the term “by law
of the land” was equivalent to “due process of law,” which he in
turn defined as “by due process of the common law,” that is, “by
the indictment or presentment of good and lawful men . . . or by
writ original of the Common Law.” 419 The significance of both terms
was procedural, but there was in Coke’s writings on chapter 29 a
rudimentary concept of substantive restrictions, which did not de-
velop in England because of parliamentary supremacy, but which
was to flower in the United States.
     The term “law of the land” was early the preferred expression
in colonial charters and declarations of rights, which gave way to
the term “due process of law,” although some state constitutions con-
tinued to employ both terms. Whichever phraseology was used, the
expression seems generally to have occurred in close association with
precise safeguards of accused persons, but, as is true of the Fifth
Amendment here under consideration, the provision also suggests
some limitations on substance because of its association with the
guarantee of just compensation upon the taking of private property
for public use.420

process” would seem to refer solely and simply to procedure, to pro-

ENGLISH CONSTITUTION, 1300–1629, 86–97 (1948), recounting several statutory reconfir-

delineation.
