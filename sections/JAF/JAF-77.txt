     The Court, in opinions that bespeak a sense of necessity to nar-
rowly construe Miranda, has broadened the permissible impeach-
ment purposes for which unlawful confessions and admissions may
be used.391 Thus, in Harris v. New York,392 the Court held that the
prosecution could use statements, obtained in violation of Miranda,
to impeach the defendant’s testimony if he voluntarily took the stand
and denied commission of the offense. Subsequently, in Oregon v.
Hass,393 the Court permitted impeachment use of a statement made
by the defendant after police had ignored his request for counsel
following his Miranda warning. Such impeachment material, how-
ever, must still meet the standard of voluntariness associated with
the pre-Miranda tests for the admission of confessions and state-
ments.394
     The Court has created a “public safety” exception to the Miranda
warning requirement, but has refused to create another exception
for misdemeanors and lesser offenses. In New York v. Quarles,395
the Court held admissible a recently apprehended suspect’s re-
sponse in a public supermarket to the arresting officer’s demand to
know the location of a gun that the officer had reason to believe
the suspect had just discarded or hidden in the supermarket. The
Court, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist,396 declined to place offi-
cers in the “untenable position” of having to make instant deci-
sions as to whether to proceed with Miranda warnings and thereby
increase the risk to themselves or to the public or whether to dis-
may be the poisonous fruit of other constitutional violations, such as illegal searches
or arrests. E.g., Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590 (1975); Dunaway v. New York, 442
U.S. 200 (1979); Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687 (1982).
     391 Under Walter v. United States, 347 U.S. 62 (1954), the defendant not only

denied the offense of which he was accused (sale of drugs), but also asserted he had
never dealt in drugs. The prosecution was permitted to impeach him concerning heroin
seized illegally from his home two years before. The Court observed that the defen-
dant could have denied the offense without making the “sweeping” assertions, as to
which the government could impeach him.
     392 401 U.S. 222 (1971). The defendant had denied only the commission of the

offense. The Court observed that it was only “speculative” to think that impermis-
sible police conduct would be encouraged by permitting such impeachment, a resort
to deterrence analysis being contemporaneously used to ground the Fourth Amend-
ment exclusionary rule, whereas the defendant’s right to testify was the obligation
to testify truthfully and the prosecution could impeach him for committing perjury.
See also United States v. Havens, 446 U.S. 620 (1980) (Fourth Amendment).
     393 420 U.S. 714 (1975). By contrast, a defendant may not be impeached by evi-

dence of his silence after police have warned him of his right to remain silent. Doyle
v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).
     394 E.g., Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385 (1978); New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S.

450 (1979).
     395 467 U.S. 649 (1984).
     396 The Court’s opinion was joined by Chief Justice Burger and by Justices White,

Blackmun, and Powell. Justice O’Connor would have ruled inadmissible the sus-
pect’s response, but not the gun retrieved as a result of the response, and Justices
Marshall, Brennan, and Stevens dissented.
