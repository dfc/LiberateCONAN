not invalidate administrative proceedings where the record shows
that at no time during the hearing was there any misunderstand-
ing as to the basis of the complaint.448 The mere admission of evi-
dence that would be inadmissible in judicial proceedings does not
vitiate the order of an administrative agency.449 A provision that
such a body shall not be controlled by rules of evidence does not,
however, justify orders without a foundation in evidence having ra-
tional probative force. Hearsay may be received in an administra-
tive hearing and may constitute by itself substantial evidence in
support of an agency determination, provided that there are pres-
ent factors which assure the underlying reliability and probative
value of the evidence and, at least in the case at hand, where the
claimant before the agency had the opportunity to subpoena the wit-
nesses and cross-examine them with regard to the evidence.450 Al-
though the Court has recognized that in some circumstances a “fair
hearing” implies a right to oral argument,451 it has refused to lay
down a general rule that would cover all cases.452
     In the light of the historically unquestioned power of a command-
ing officer summarily to exclude civilians from the area of his com-
mand, and applicable Navy regulations that confirm this authority,
together with a stipulation in the contract between a restaurant con-
cessionaire and the Naval Gun Factory forbidding employment on
the premises of any person not meeting security requirements, due
process was not denied by the summary exclusion on security grounds
of the concessionaire’s cook, without hearing or advice as to the ba-
sis for the exclusion. The Fifth Amendment does not require a trial-
United States v. Nugent, 346 U.S. 1 (1953) (in auxiliary hearing that culminated in
a Justice Department report and recommendation, it is sufficient that registrant be
provided with resume of adverse evidence in FBI report because the “imperative needs
of mobilization and national vigilance” mandate a minimum of “litigious interrup-
tion”), and Gonzales v. United States, 364 U.S. 59 (1960) (five-to-four decision find-
ing no due process violation when petitioner (1) at departmental proceedings was
not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by his local board, because the
statements were in his file and he had opportunity to rebut both before hearing of-
ficer and appeal board, nor (2) at trial was denied access to hearing officer’s notes
and report, because he failed to show any need and did have Department recommen-
dations).

which the majority rejected Justice Black’s dissenting thesis that the dismissal with
prejudice of a damage suit without notice to the client and grounded upon the dila-
tory tactics of his attorney, and the latter’s failure to appear at a pre-trial confer-
ence, amounted to a taking of property without due process of law.
