dom of will or self-control essential to make his confession volun-
tary within the meaning of the law.” 279 Subsequent cases followed
essentially the same line of thought.280
     Then, language in the 1897 case of Bram v. United States opened
the door to eventually extending the doctrinal basis for analyzing
the admissibility of a confession beyond the common-law test that
focused on voluntariness as an indicator of the confession’s trust-
worthiness as evidence. “In criminal trials, in the courts of the United
States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompe-
tent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion
of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
commanding that no person ‘shall be compelled in any criminal case
to be a witness against himself.’ ” 281 However, though this ap-
proach 282 and the case itself were subsequently approved in sev-
eral cases,283 the Court would still hold in 1912 that a confession
should not be excluded merely because the authorities had not warned
a suspect of his right to remain silent,284 and more than once later
opinions could doubt “whether involuntary confessions are ex-
cluded from federal criminal trials on the ground of a violation of
the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination, or from
a rule that forced confessions are untrustworthy. . . .” 285 One rea-
son for this was that the Self-Incrimination Clause had not yet been
made applicable to the states, thereby requiring that the admissi-
bility of confessions in state courts be determined under due pro-
cess standards developed from common-law principles. It was only
after the Court extended the Self-Incrimination Clause to the states
that a divided Court reaffirmed and extended the 1897 Bram rul-
ing and imposed on both federal and state trial courts new rules

States, 156 U.S. 51 (1895). In Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613 (1896), failure
to provide counsel or to warn the suspect of his right to remain silent was held to
have no effect on the admissibility of a confession but was only to be considered in
assessing its credibility.

held that the circumstances of detention and interrogation were relevant and per-
haps controlling on the question of admissibility of a confession.
