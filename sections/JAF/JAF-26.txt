acterized the “waiver” theory as “totally unsound and indefensible,” 126
the Court has been hesitant in formulating a new theory in main-
taining the practice.127
    An exception to full application of the retrial rule exists, how-
ever, when defendant on trial for an offense is convicted of a lesser
offense and succeeds in having that conviction set aside. Thus, in
Green v. United States,128 the defendant had been placed on trial
for first degree murder but convicted of second degree murder; the
Court held that, following reversal of that conviction, he could not
be tried again for first degree murder, although he certainly could
be for second degree murder, on the theory that the first verdict
was an implicit acquittal of the first degree murder charge.129 Even
though the Court thought the jury’s action in the first trial was clearly
erroneous, the Double Jeopardy Clause required that the jury’s im-
plicit acquittal be respected.130
    Still another exception arises out of appellate reversals grounded
on evidentiary insufficiency. Thus, in Burks v. United States,131 the
appellate court set aside the defendant’s conviction on the basis that
     126 Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 197 (1957). The more recent cases con-

tinue to reject a “waiver” theory. E.g., United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 609
n.11 (1976); United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 99 (1978).
     127 Justice Holmes, dissenting in Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 134

(1904), rejected the “waiver” theory and propounded a theory of “continuing jeop-
ardy,” which also continues to be rejected. See discussion, supra. In some cases, a
concept of “election” by the defendant has been suggested, United States v. Scott,
437 U.S. 82, 93 (1978); Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 152–54 (1977), but it
is not clear how this formulation might differ from “waiver.” Chief Justice Burger
has suggested that “probably a more satisfactory explanation” for permissibility of
retrial in this situation “lies in analysis of the respective interests involved,” Breed
v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 533–35 (1975), and a determination that on balance the in-
terests of both prosecution and defense are well served by the rule. See United States
v. Tateo, 377 U.S. 463, 466 (1964); Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 39–40 (1982).
     128 355 U.S. 184 (1957).
     129 The decision necessarily overruled Trono v. United States, 199 U.S. 521 (1905),

although the Court purported to distinguish the decision. Green v. United States,
355 U.S. 184, 194–97 (1957). See also Brantley v. Georgia, 217 U.S. 284 (1910) (no
due process violation where defendant is convicted of higher offense on second trial).
     130 See also Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323 (1970). The defendant was tried for

murder and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. He obtained a reversal, was
again tried for murder, and again convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Acknowl-
edging that, after reversal, Price could have been tried for involuntary manslaugh-
ter, the Court nonetheless reversed the second conviction because he had been sub-
jected to the hazard of twice being tried for murder, in violation of the Double Jeopardy
Clause, and the effect on the jury of the murder charge being pressed could have
prejudiced him to the extent of the second conviction. But cf. Morris v. Mathews,
475 U.S. 237 (1986) (inadequate showing of prejudice resulting from reducing jeopardy-
barred conviction for aggravated murder to non-jeopardy-barred conviction for first
degree murder). “To prevail in a case like this, the defendant must show that, but
for the improper inclusion of the jeopardy-barred charge, the result of the proceed-
ing probably would have been different.” Id. at 247.
