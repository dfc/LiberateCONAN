can be no valid claim if there is no criminal prosecution 198 The Court
in recent years has also applied the privilege to situations, such as
police interrogation of suspects, in which there is no legal compul-
sion to speak.199
    What the privilege protects against is compulsion of “testimo-
nial” disclosures. Thus, the clause is not offended by such non-
testimonial compulsions as requiring a person in custody to stand
or walk in a police lineup, to speak prescribed words, to model par-
ticular clothing, or to give samples of handwriting, fingerprints, or
blood.200 A person may be compelled to produce specific documents
even though they contain incriminating information.201 If, however,
the existence of specific documents is not known to the govern-
ment, and the act of production informs the government about the

by suspect interrogated in hospital but not prosecuted).
     199 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).
     200 Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 764 (1966); United States v. Wade,

388 U.S. 218, 221–23 (1967); Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 252 (1910). In
California v. Byers, 402 U.S. 424 (1971), four Justices believed that requiring any
person involved in a traffic accident to stop and give his name and address did not
involve testimonial compulsion and therefore the privilege was inapplicable, id. at
431–34 (Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart, White, and Blackmun), but Jus-
tice Harlan, id. at 434 (concurring), and Justices Black, Douglas, Brennan, and Mar-
shall, id. at 459, 464 (dissenting), disagreed. In South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S.
553 (1983), the Court indicated as well that a state may compel a motorist sus-
pected of drunk driving to submit to a blood alcohol test, and may also give the
suspect a choice about whether to submit, but use his refusal to submit to the test
as evidence against him. The Court rested its evidentiary ruling on the absence of
coercion, preferring not to apply the sometimes difficult distinction between testimo-
nial and physical evidence. In another case, involving roadside videotaping of a drunk
driving suspect, the Court found that the slurred nature of the suspect’s speech, as
well as his answers to routine booking questions as to name, address, weight, height,
eye color, date of birth, and current age, were not testimonial in nature. Pennsylva-
nia v. Muniz, 496 U.S. 582 (1990). On the other hand, the suspect’s answer to a
request to identify the date of his sixth birthday was considered testimonial. Id. Two
Justices challenged the interpretation limiting application to “testimonial” disclo-
sures, claiming that the original understanding of the word “witness” was not lim-
ited to someone who gives testimony, but included someone who gives any kind of
evidence. United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 49 (2000) (Justice Thomas, joined
by Justice Scalia, concurring).
     201 Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976). Compelling a taxpayer by sub-

poena to produce documents produced by his accountants from his own papers does
not involve testimonial self-incrimination and is not barred by the privilege. “[T]he
Fifth Amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled production of ev-
ery sort of incriminating evidence but applies only when the accused is compelled to
make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.” Id. at 408 (emphasis by
Court). Even further removed from the protection of the privilege is seizure pursu-
ant to a search warrant of business records in the handwriting of the defendant.
Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463 (1976). A court order compelling a target of a
grand jury investigation to sign a consent directive authorizing foreign banks to dis-
close records of any and all accounts over which he had a right of withdrawal is not
testimonial in nature, since the factual assertions are required of the banks and not
of the target. Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201 (1988).
