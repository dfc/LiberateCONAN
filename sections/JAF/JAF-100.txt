quiring it to file a summary of its books and records pertaining to
its rates was also held not to violate the Fifth Amendment.508
    Congressional Regulation of Railroads.—Legislation and ad-
ministrative orders pertaining to railroads have been challenged re-
peatedly under the Due Process Clause, but seldom with success.
Orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission establishing through
routes and joint rates have been sustained,509 as has the Commis-
sion’s division of joint rates to give a weaker group of carriers a
greater share of such rates where the proportion allotted to the stron-
ger group was adequate to avoid confiscation.510 The recapture of
one-half of the earnings of railroads in excess of a fair net operat-
ing income, such recaptured earnings to be available as a revolving
fund for loans to weaker roads, was held valid on the ground that
any carrier earning an excess held it as trustee.511 An order enjoin-
ing certain steam railroads from discriminating against an electric
railroad by denying it reciprocal switching privileges did not vio-
late the Fifth Amendment even through its practical effect was to
admit the electric road to a part of the business being adequately
handled by the steam roads.512 Similarly, the fact that a rule con-
cerning the allotment of coal cars operated to restrict the use of
private cars did not amount to a taking of property.513 Railroad com-
panies were not denied due process of law by a statute forbidding
them to transport in interstate commerce commodities that they manu-
factured, mined, or produced.514 An order approving a lease of one
railroad by another, upon condition that displaced employees of the
lessor should receive partial compensation for the loss suffered by
reason of the lease,515 is consonant with due process of law. A law
prohibiting the issuance of free passes was held constitutional even
as applied to abolish rights created by a prior agreement by which
the carrier bound itself to issue such passes annually for life, in
settlement of a claim for personal injuries.516 A non-arbitrary Inter-
state Commerce Commission order establishing a non-compensatory
rate for carriage of certain commodities does not violate the Due
