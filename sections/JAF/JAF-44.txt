and receipt of a Miranda warning he remained silent and did not
give the police the exculpatory story he told at trial.216 But where
the defendant took the stand and testified, the Court permitted the
impeachment use of his pre-arrest silence when that silence had in
no way been officially encouraged, through a Miranda warning or
otherwise.217
    Further, the Court held inadmissible at the subsequent trial a
defendant’s testimony at a hearing to suppress evidence wrongfully
seized, because use of the testimony would put the defendant to an
impermissible choice between asserting his right to remain silent
and invoking his right to be free of illegal searches and seizures.218
The Court also proscribed the introduction at a second trial of the
defendant’s testimony at his first trial, given to rebut a confession
which was subsequently held inadmissible, since the testimony was
in effect “fruit of the poisonous tree,” and had been “coerced” from
the defendant through use of the confession.219 Potentially most far-
reaching was a holding that invalidated the penalty structure of a
statute under which defendants could escape a possible death sen-
tence by entering a guilty plea; the statute “needlessly encour-
age[d]” waivers of defendant’s Fifth Amendment right to plead not
guilty and his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.220
    Although this “needless encouragement” test assessed the na-
ture of the choice required to be made by defendants against the

    216 Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976). Post-arrest silence, the Court stated, is

inherently ambiguous, and to permit use of the silence would be unfair since the
Miranda warning told the defendant he could be silent. The same result had earlier
been achieved under the Court’s supervisory power over federal trials in United States
v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171 (1975). The same principles apply to bar a prosecutor’s use of
Miranda silence as evidence of an arrestee’s sanity. Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474
U.S. 284 (1986). In determining whether a state prisoner is entitled to federal ha-
beas corpus relief because the prosecution violated due process by using his post-
Miranda silence for impeachment purposes at trial, the proper standard for harmless-
error review is that announced in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776
(1946)—whether the due process error had substantial and injurious effect or influ-
ence in determining the jury’s verdict—not the stricter “harmless beyond a reason-
able doubt” standard of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967), applicable
on direct review. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993). See also Fry v. Pliler,
551 U.S. 112, 114 (2007) (the “substantial and injurious effect” standard is to be
applied in federal habeas proceedings even “when the state appellate court failed to
recognize the error and did not review it for harmlessness under the ‘harmless be-
yond a reasonable doubt’ standard set forth in Chapman v. California”).
    217 Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231 (1980). Cf. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S.

308 (1976) (prison disciplinary hearing may draw adverse inferences from inmate’s
assertion of privilege so long as this was not the sole basis of decision against him).
    218 Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377 (1968). The rationale of the case

was subsequently limited to Fourth Amendment grounds in McGautha v. California,
402 U.S. 183, 210–13 (1971).
    219 Harrison v. United States, 392 U.S. 219 (1968).
    220 Jackson v. United States, 390 U.S. 570, 583 (1968).
