of damages will not be overturned on appeal, even though as a con-
sequence of error therein the property owner received less than he
was entitled to.664

When Property Is Taken
    The issue whether one’s property has been “taken” with the con-
sequent requirement of just compensation can hardly arise when
government institutes condemnation proceedings directed to it. Where,
however, physical damage results to property because of govern-
ment action, or where regulatory action limits activity on the prop-
erty or otherwise deprives it of value,665 whether there has been a
taking in the Fifth Amendment sense becomes critical.
    Government Activity Not Directed at the Property.—The older
cases proceeded on the basis that the requirement of just compen-
sation for property taken for public use referred only to “direct ap-
propriation, and not to consequential injuries resulting from the ex-
ercise of lawful power.” 666 Accordingly, a variety of consequential
injuries were held not to constitute takings: damage to abutting prop-
erty resulting from the authorization of a railroad to erect tracts,
sheds, and fences over a street; 667 similar deprivations, lessening
the circulation of light and air and impairing access to premises,
resulting from the erection of an elevated viaduct over a street, or
resulting from the changing of a grade in the street.668 Nor was
government held liable for the extra expense which the property
owner must obligate in order to ward off the consequence of the
governmental action, such as the expenses incurred by a railroad
in planking an area condemned for a crossing, constructing gates,
and posting gatemen,669 or by a landowner in raising the height of
     664 229 U.S. at 371. See also Provo Bench Canal Co. v. Tanner, 239 U.S. 323

(1915); Appleby v. City of Buffalo, 221 U.S. 524 (1911).
     665 The Court has not yet determined whether the actions of a court may give

rise to a taking. In Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environ-
mental Protection, Justice Scalia, joined by three other Justices, recognized that a
court could effect a taking through a decision that contravened established property
law. 560 U.S. ___, No. 08–1151, slip op. (2010). Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer,
each joined by one other Justice, wrote concurring opinions finding that the case at
hand did not require the Court to determine whether, or when, a judicial decision
on the rights of a property owner can violate the Takings Clause. Though all eight
participating Justices agreed on the result in Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc,
the viability and dimensions of a judicial takings doctrine thus remains unresolved.
     666 Legal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 457, 551 (1871). The Fifth Amend-

ment “has never been supposed to have any bearing upon, or to inhibit laws that
indirectly work harm and loss to individuals,” the Court explained.
