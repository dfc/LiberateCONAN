less, the Court did continue to cite at times age and intelligence as
demonstrating the susceptibility of the particular suspects to even
mild coercion.311
    The “totality of the circumstances” was looked to in determin-
ing admissibility. In some of the cases a single factor could be thought
to stand out as indicating the involuntariness of the confession,312
but in other cases the Court recited a number of contributing fac-
tors, including age, intelligence, incommunicado detention, denial
of requested counsel, denial of access to friends, trickery, and other
things, without seeming to rank any factor above the others.313 Con-
fessions induced through the exploitation of some illegal action, such
as an illegal arrest 314 or an unlawful search and seizure,315 were
found inadmissible. Where police obtain a subsequent confession af-
ter obtaining one that is inadmissible as involuntary, the Court did
not assume that the subsequent confession was similarly involun-
tary, but independently evaluated whether the coercive actions which
produced the first continued to produce the later confession.316
    From the Voluntariness Standard to Miranda.—Invocation
by the Court of a self-incrimination standard for judging the fruits
falsely stating that his job as a policeman and the welfare of his family was at stake);
Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534 (1961) (suspect resisted questioning for six hours
but yielded when officers threatened to bring his invalid wife to headquarters). More
recent cases include Davis v. North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737 (1966) (escaped convict
held incommunicado 16 days but periods of interrogation each day were about an
hour each); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U.S. 519 (1968); Darwin v. Connecticut,
391 U.S. 346 (1968).
     311 Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.S. 49 (1962); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S.

199 (1960); Fikes v. Alabama, 352 U.S. 191 (1957); Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560
(1958); Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433 (1961); Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568 (1961).
The suspect in Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315 (1959), was a 25-year-old foreigner
with a history of emotional instability. The fact that the suspect was a woman was
apparently significant in Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528 (1963), in which officers
threatened to have her children taken from her and to have her taken off the wel-
fare relief rolls.
     But a suspect’s mental state alone—even insanity—is insufficient to establish
involuntariness absent some coercive police activity. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S.
157 (1986).
     312 E.g., Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556 (1954) (confession obtained by psychia-

trist trained in hypnosis from a physically and emotionally exhausted suspect who
had already been subjected to three days of interrogation); Townsend v. Sain, 372
U.S. 293 (1963) (suspect was administered drug with properties of “truth serum” to
relieve withdrawal pains of narcotics addiction, although police probably were not
aware of drug’s side effects).
     313 E.g., Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719 (1966); Davis v. North Carolina,

384 U.S. 737 (1966); Ashdown v. Utah, 357 U.S. 426 (1958); Thomas v. Arizona, 356
U.S. 390 (1958).
     314 Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963).
     315 Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85 (1963).
     316 United States v. Bayer, 331 U.S. 532 (1947); Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S.

596 (1944); Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556 (1954); Darwin v. Connecticut, 391 U.S.
346 (1968).
