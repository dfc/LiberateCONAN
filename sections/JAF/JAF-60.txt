untary operated under a severe handicap, as the interrogation process
was in secret with only police and the suspect witness to it, and as
the concept of voluntariness referred to the defendant’s mental con-
dition.299 Despite, then, a bountiful number of cases, binding prec-
edents were few.
    On the one hand, many of the early cases disclosed clear in-
stances of coercion of a nature that the Court could little doubt pro-
duced involuntary confessions. Not only physical torture,300 but other
overtly coercive tactics as well were condemned. Chambers v. Florida 301
held that five days of prolonged questioning following arrests with-
out warrants and incommunicado detention made the subsequent
confessions involuntary. Ashcraft v. Tennessee 302 held inadmissible
a confession obtained near the end of a 36-hour period of practi-
cally continuous questioning, under powerful electric lights, by re-
lays of officers, experienced investigators, and highly trained law-
yers. Similarly, Ward v. Texas,303 voided a conviction based on a
confession obtained from a suspect who had been questioned con-
tinuously over the course of three days while being driven from county
to county and told falsely of a danger of lynching. “Since Chambers
v. State of Florida, . . . this Court has recognized that coercion can
be mental as well as physical and that the blood of the accused is
not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition. A number
of cases have demonstrated, if demonstrations were needed, that
     299 “The inquiry whether, in a particular case, a confession was voluntarily or

involuntarily made involves, at the least, a three-phased process. First, there is the
business of finding the crude historical facts, the external ‘phenomenological’ occur-
rences and events surrounding the confession. Second, because the concept of ‘voluntari-
ness’ is one which concerns a mental state, there is the imaginative recreation, largely
inferential, of internal, ‘psychological’ fact. Third, there is the application to this psy-
chological fact of standards for judgment informed by the larger legal conceptions
ordinarily characterized as rules of law but which, also, comprehend both induction
from, and anticipation of, factual circumstances.” 367 U.S. at 603. See Developments
in the Law—Confessions, 79 HARV. L. REV. 935, 973–82 (1966).

     301 309 U.S. 227 (1940).
     302 322 U.S. 143 (1944). Dissenting, Justices Jackson, Frankfurter, and Roberts

protested that “interrogation per se is not, while violence per se is, an outlaw.” A
confession made after interrogation was not truly “voluntary” because all question-
ing is “inherently coercive,” because it puts pressure upon a suspect to talk. Thus,
in evaluating a confession made after interrogation, the Court must, they insisted,
determine whether the suspect was in possession of his own will and self-control
and not look alone to the length or intensity of the interrogation. They accused the
majority of “read[ing] an indiscriminating hostility to mere interrogation into the
Constitution” and preparing to bar all confessions made after questioning. Id. at 156.
A possible result of the dissent was the decision in Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596
(1944), which stressed deference to state-court factfinding in assessing the voluntari-
ness of confessions.
