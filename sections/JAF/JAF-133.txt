sult that could have been achieved in the courts—by adjacent land
owners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State’s law
of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power
to abate [public] nuisances . . . , or otherwise.” 724 Thus, while there
is no broad “noxious use” exception separating police power regula-
tions from takings, there is a narrower “background principles” ex-
ception based on the law of nuisance and unspecified “property law”
principles.
     Together with the investment-backed expectations factor of Penn
Central, background principles were viewed by many lower courts
as supporting a “notice rule” under which a taking claim was abso-
lutely barred if based on a restriction imposed under a regulatory
regime predating plaintiff ’s acquisition of the property. In Palaz-
zolo v. Rhode Island,725 the Court forcefully rejected the absolute
version of the notice rule, regardless of rationale. Under such a rule,
it said, “[a] State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration
date on the Takings Clause.” 726 Whether any role is left for preacquisi-
tion regulation in the takings analysis, however, the Court’s major-
ity opinion did not say, leaving the issue to dueling concurrences
from Justice O’Connor (prior regulation remains a factor) and Jus-
tice Scalia (prior regulation is irrelevant). Less than a year later,
Justice O’Connor’s concurrence carried the day in extended dicta
in Tahoe-Sierra,727 though the decision failed to elucidate the fac-
tors affecting the weighting to be accorded the pre-existing regime.
     The “or otherwise” reference, the Court explained in Lucas,728
was principally directed to cases holding that in times of great pub-
lic peril, such as war, spreading municipal fires, and the like, prop-
erty may be taken and destroyed without necessitating compensa-
tion. Thus, in United States v. Caltex, Inc.,729 the owners of property
destroyed by retreating United States armies in Manila during World
War II were held not entitled to compensation, and in United States
v. Central Eureka Mining Co.,730 the Court held that a federal or-
der suspending the operations of a nonessential gold mine for the
duration of the war in order to redistribute the miners, unaccompa-

Walters, 294 U.S. 405, 429 (1935), a regulation case, to the effect that “when particu-
lar individuals are singled out to bear the cost of advancing the public convenience,
that imposition must bear some reasonable relation to the evils to be eradicated or
the advantages to be secured.”
