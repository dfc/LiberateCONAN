     Administrative Proceedings: A Fair Hearing.—With re-
spect to action taken by administrative agencies, the Court has held
that the demands of due process do not require a hearing at the
initial stage, or at any particular point in the proceeding, so long
as a hearing is held before the final order becomes effective.441 In
Bowles v. Willingham,442 the Court sustained orders fixing maxi-
mum rents issued without a hearing at any stage, saying “where
Congress has provided for judicial review after the regulations or
orders have been made effective it has done all that due process
under the war emergency requires.” But where, after consideration
of charges brought against an employer by a complaining union,
the National Labor Relations Board undertook to void an agree-
ment between an employer and another independent union, the lat-
ter was entitled to notice and an opportunity to participate in the
proceedings.443 Although a taxpayer must be afforded a fair oppor-
tunity for a hearing in connection with the collection of taxes,444
collection by distraint of personal property is lawful if the taxpayer
is allowed a hearing thereafter.445
     When the Constitution requires a hearing, it requires a fair one,
held before a tribunal that meets currently prevailing standards of
impartiality.446 A party must be given an opportunity not only to
present evidence, but also to know the claims of the opposing party
and to meet them. Those who are brought into contest with the gov-
ernment in a quasi-judicial proceeding aimed at control of their ac-
tivities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the government pro-
poses and to be heard upon the proposal before the final command
is issued.447 But a variance between the charges and findings will

102 U.S. 586, 593 (1881); Passavant v. United States, 148 U.S. 214 (1893). The col-
lection of taxes is, however, very nearly a wholly unique area. See Perez v. Ledesma,
401 U.S. 82, 127 n.17 (1971) (Justice Brennan concurring in part and dissenting in
part). On the limitations on private prejudgment collection, see Sniadach v. Family

before probably partial officer at pretermination stage).
     447 Margan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18–19 (1938). The Court has experi-

enced some difficulty with application of this principle to administrative hearings
and subsequent review in selective service cases. Compare Gonzales v. United States,
348 U.S. 407 (1955) (conscientious objector contesting his classification before ap-
peals board must be furnished copy of recommendation submitted by Department of
Justice; only by being appraised of the arguments and conclusions upon which rec-
ommendations were based would he be enabled to present his case effectively), with
