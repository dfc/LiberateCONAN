population for questioning.357 This view on prison interrogations evi-
dences the Court’s continuing movement toward individualized analy-
ses of Miranda issues based on particular circumstances and away
from the more categorical decisions announced soon after Miranda.
Still, some of the early decisions may retain vitality. One example
is the 1969 decision in Orozco v. Texas, which held that question-
ing a person upon his arrest in his home is custodial.358 On the
other hand, the fact that a suspect may be present in a police sta-
tion does not necessarily mean, in the absence of further restric-
tions, that questioning is custodial,359 and the fact that he is in his
home or other familiar surroundings will ordinarily lead to a con-
clusion that the inquiry was noncustodial.360 Also, if a person has
been subjected to Miranda custody, that custody ends when he is


     357 Howes v. Fields, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–680, slip op. (2012) (taking a prisoner

incarcerated for disorderly conduct aside for questioning about an unrelated child
molestation incident held, 6–3, not to constitute custodial interrogation under the
totality of the circumstances in the case), distinguishing Mathis v. United States,
391 U.S. 1 (1968) (questioning state prisoner about unrelated federal tax violation
held to be custodial interrogation). While the Howes Court split 6–3 on whether a
custodial interrogation had taken place for Fifth Amendment purposes, the case was
before it on habeas review, which requires that a clearly established Supreme Court
precedent mandates a contrary result. All the Howes Justices agreed that Mathis
had not, for purposes of habeas review of a state case, “clearly established” that all
private questioning of an inmate about previous, outside conduct was “custodial” per
se. Rather, Howes explained that a broader assessment of all relevant factors in each
case was necessary to establish coercive pressure amounting to “custody.” Cf. Mary-
land v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–680, slip op. (2010) (extended release of inter-
rogated inmate back into the general prison population broke “custody” for purposes
of later questioning); see also Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292 (1990) (inmate’s con-
versation with an undercover agent does not create a coercive, police-dominated en-
vironment and does not implicate Miranda if the suspect does not know that he is
conversing with a government agent).
     358 394 U.S. 324 (1969) (police entered suspect’s bedroom at 4 a.m., told him he

was under arrest, and questioned him; four of the eight Justices who took part in
the case, including three dissenters, voiced concern about this “broadening” of Miranda
beyond the police station).
     359 Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492 (1977) (suspect came voluntarily to po-

lice station to be questioned, he was not placed under arrest while there, and he
was allowed to leave at end of interview, even though he was named by victim as
culprit, questioning took place behind closed doors, and he was falsely informed his
fingerprints had been found at scene of crime); Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___, No.
12–246, slip op. (2013) (voluntarily accompanying police to station for questioning).
Cf. Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318 (1994). See also Minnesota v. Murphy, 465
U.S. 420 (1984) (required reporting to probationary officer is not custodial situa-
tion); Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004) (state court determination that
teenager brought to police station by his parents was not “in custody” was not “un-
reasonable” for purposes of federal habeas review under the standards of the Anti-
terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)).
     360 Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 341 (1976) (IRS agents’ interview with

taxpayer in private residence was not a custodial interrogation, although inquiry
had “focused” on him).
