nated himself. Nonetheless, the Court held, “when an accused has
invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interro-
gation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by show-
ing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial in-
terrogation even if he has been advised of this rights. We further
hold that an accused . . . , having expressed his desire to deal with
the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interroga-
tion by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him,
unless the accused himself initiates further communication, ex-
changes, or conversations with the police.” 375 The Edwards rule bars
police-initiated questioning stemming from a separate investiga-
tion as well as questioning relating to the crime for which the sus-
pect was arrested.376 It also applies to interrogation by officers of a
different law enforcement authority.377
    On the other hand, the Edwards rule requiring that a lawyer
be provided to a suspect who had requested one in an earlier inter-
rogation does not apply once there has been a meaningful break in
custody. The Court in Maryland v. Shatzer 378 characterized the Ed-
wards rule as a judicially prescribed precaution against using the
coercive pressure of prolonged custody to badger a suspect who has
previously requested counsel into talking without one. However, af-
ter a suspect has been released to resume his normal routine for a
sufficient period to dissipate the coercive effects of custody, a period
set at 14 days by the Shatzer Court, the rationale for solicitous treat-

     375 451 U.S. at 484–85. The decision was unanimous, but three concurrences ob-

jected to a special rule limiting waivers with respect to counsel to suspect-initiated
further exchanges. Id. at 487, 488 (Chief Justice Burger and Justices Powell and
Rehnquist). In Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. 1039 (1983), the Court held, albeit
without a majority of Justices in complete agreement as to rationale, that an ac-
cused who had initiated further conversations with police had knowingly and intel-
ligently waived his right to have counsel present. So too, an accused who expressed
a willingness to talk to police, but who refused to make a written statement with-
out presence of counsel, was held to have waived his rights with respect to his oral
statements. Connecticut v. Barrett, 479 U.S. 523 (1987).
     In Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 146 (1990), the Court interpreted Edwards
to bar interrogation without counsel present of a suspect who had earlier consulted
with an attorney on the accusation at issue. “[W]hen counsel is requested, interroga-
tion must cease, and officials may not reinstate interrogation without counsel pres-
ent, whether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.” Id. at 153.
     The Court has held that Edwards should not be applied retroactively to a con-
viction that had become final, Solem v. Stumes, 465 U.S. 638 (1984), but that Ed-
wards does apply to cases pending on appeal at the time it was decided. Shea v.
Louisiana, 470 U.S. 51 (1985).
     376 Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U.S. 675 (1988). By contrast, the Sixth Amend-

ment right to counsel is offense-specific, and does not bar questioning about a crime
unrelated to the crime for which the suspect has been charged. See McNeil v. Wis-
consin, 501 U.S. 171 (1991).
     377 Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 146 (1990).
     378 559 U.S. ___, No. 08–680, slip op. (2010).
