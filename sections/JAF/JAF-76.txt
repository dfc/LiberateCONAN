of cases, a waiver need not always be express, nor does Miranda
impose a formalistic waiver procedure.384
    In Berghuis v. Thompkins, citing the societal benefit of requir-
ing an accused to invoke Miranda rights unambiguously, the Court
refocused its Miranda waiver analysis to whether a suspect under-
stood his rights.385 There, a suspect refused to sign a waiver form,
remained largely silent during the ensuing 2-hour and 45-minute
interrogation, but then made an incriminating statement. The five-
Justice majority found that the suspect had failed to invoke his right
to remain silent and also implicitly had waived the right. Accord-
ing to the Court, though a statement following silence alone may
not be adequate to show a waiver, the prosecution may show an
implied waiver by demonstrating that a suspect understood the
Miranda warnings given him and subsequently made an uncoerced
statement.386 Further, once a suspect has knowingly and volun-
tarily waived his Miranda rights, police officers may continue ques-
tioning until and unless the suspect clearly invokes them later.387
    Sixth, the admissions of an unwarned or improperly warned sus-
pect may not be used directly against him at trial, but the Court
has permitted some use for other purposes, such as impeachment.
A confession or other incriminating admissions obtained in viola-
tion of Miranda may not, of course, be introduced against him at
trial for purposes of establishing guilt 388 or for determining the sen-
tence, at least in bifurcated trials in capital cases.389 On the other
hand, the “fruits” of such an unwarned confession or admission may
be used in some circumstances if the statement was voluntary.390

     384 North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369 (1979). In Butler, the defendant had

refused to sign a waiver but agreed to talk with FBI agents nonetheless. On consid-
ering whether the defendant had thereby waived his right to counsel (his right to
remain silent aside), the Court held that no express oral or written statement was
required. Though the defendant was never directly responsive on his desire for coun-
sel, the Court found that a waiver could be inferred from his actions and words.

     387 Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994) (suspect’s statement that “maybe

I should talk to a lawyer,” uttered after Miranda waiver and after an hour and a
half of questioning, did not constitute such a clear request for an attorney when, in
response to a direct follow-up question, he said “no, I don’t want a lawyer”).

trial of defendant’s testimony at his first trial rebutting confessions obtained in vio-

     389 Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981). The Court has yet to consider the ap-

plicability of the ruling in a noncapital, nonbifurcated trial case.
