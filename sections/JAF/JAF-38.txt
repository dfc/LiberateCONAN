unwarranted governmental intrusion.183 To protect these interests
and to preserve these values, the privilege “is not to be interpreted
literally.” Rather, the “sole concern [of the privilege] is, as its name
indicates, with the danger to a witness forced to give testimony lead-
ing to the infliction of penalties affixed to the criminal acts.” 184 Fur-
thermore, “[t]he privilege afforded not only extends to answers that
would in themselves support a conviction . . . but likewise em-
braces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence
needed to prosecute . . . .” 185
     The privilege against self incrimination parries the general ob-
ligation to provide testimony under oath when called upon, but it
also applies in police interrogations. In all cases, the privilege must
be supported by a reasonable fear that a response will be incrimi-
natory. The issue is a matter of law for a court to determine,186 and
therefore, with limited exception, one must claim the privilege to
benefit from it.187 Otherwise, silence in the face of questioning may
be insufficient because it may not afford an adequate opportunity
either to test whether information withheld falls within the privi-
lege or to cure a violation through a grant of immunity.188 A wit-
ness who fails to explicitly claim the privilege when an affirmative

do not relate to protecting the innocent from conviction, but rather to preserving
the integrity of a judicial system in which even the guilty are not to be convicted
unless the prosecution ‘shoulder the entire load.’ . . . ”
     “The basic purpose of a trial is the determination of truth, and it is self-evident
that to deny a lawyer’s help through the technical intricacies of a criminal trial or
to deny a full opportunity to appeal a conviction because the accused is poor is to
impede that purpose and to infect a criminal proceeding with the clear danger of
convicting the innocent. . . . By contrast, the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against
self-incrimination is not an adjunct to the ascertainment of truth. That privilege,
like the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, stands as a protection of quite differ-
ent constitutional values—values reflecting the concern of our society for the right
of each individual to be let alone.” Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S.

and a suspect in inherently coercive circumstances (e.g., custodial interrogation). See

about a double murder, Salinas freely answered all questions other than one about
whether his shotgun would match shells recovered at the murder scene. He fell si-
lent on this inquiry, but did not assert the privilege against self-incrimination. At
closing argument at Salinas’s murder trial, the prosecutor argued that this silence
