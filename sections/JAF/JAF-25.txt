tion related to the defendant’s factual guilt or innocence.121 Such
dismissals relating to guilt or innocence are functional equivalents
of acquittals, whereas all other dismissals are functional equiva-
lents of mistrials.

Reprosecution Following Conviction
     A basic purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to protect a
defendant “against a second prosecution for the same offense after
conviction.” 122 It is “settled” that “no man can be twice lawfully pun-
ished for the same offense.” 123 Of course, the defendant’s interest
in finality, which informs much of double jeopardy jurisprudence, is
quite attenuated following conviction, and he will most likely ap-
peal, whereas the prosecution will ordinarily be content with its judg-
ment.124 The situation involving reprosecution ordinarily arises, there-
fore, only in the context of successful defense appeals and controversies
over punishment.
    Reprosecution After Reversal on Defendant’s Appeal.—
Generally, a defendant who is successful in having his conviction
set aside on appeal may be tried again for the same offense, the
assumption being made in the first case on the subject that, by ap-
pealing, a defendant has “waived” his objection to further prosecu-
tion by challenging the original conviction.125 Although it has char-
     121 United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978) (at close of evidence, court dis-

missed indictment for preindictment delay; ruling did not go to determination of guilt
or innocence, but, like a mistrial, permitted further proceedings that would go to
factual resolution of guilt or innocence). The Court thought that double jeopardy poli-
cies were resolvable by balancing the defendant’s interest in having the trial con-
cluded in one proceeding against the government’s right to one complete opportu-
nity to convict those who have violated the law. The defendant chose to move to
terminate the proceedings and, having made a voluntary choice, is bound to the con-
sequences, including the obligation to continue in further proceedings. Id. at 95–
101. The four dissenters would have followed Jenkins, and accused the Court of hav-
ing adopted too restrictive a definition of acquittal. Their view is that the rule against
retrials after acquittal does not, as the Court believed, “safeguard determination of
innocence; rather, it is that a retrial following a final judgment for the accused nec-
essarily threatens intolerable interference with the constitutional policy against mul-
tiple trials.” Id. at 101, 104 (Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Stevens). They
would, therefore, treat dismissals as functional equivalents of acquittals, whenever
further proceedings would be required after reversals.

     124 A prosecutor dissatisfied with the punishment imposed upon the first convic-

tion might seek another trial in order to obtain a greater sentence. Cf. Ciucci v.
Illinois, 356 U.S. 571 (1958) (under Due Process Clause, Double Jeopardy Clause
not then applying to states).
     125 United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896). The English rule precluded a new

trial in these circumstances, and circuit Justice Story adopted that view. United States
v. Gilbert, 25 Fed. Cas. 1287 (No. 15,204) (C.C.D.Mass. 1834). The history is briefly
surveyed in Justice Frankfurter’s dissent in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184,
200–05 (1957).
