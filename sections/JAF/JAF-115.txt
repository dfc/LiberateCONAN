ment plan adopted by a municipality to invigorate a depressed
economy. The Court saw no principled way to distinguish economic
development from the economic purposes endorsed in Berman and
Midkiff, and stressed the importance of judicial deference to the leg-
islative judgment as to public needs. At the same time, the Court
cautioned that private-to-private condemnations of individual prop-
erties, not part of an “integrated development plan . . . raise a sus-
picion that a private purpose [is] afoot.” 616 A vigorous four-justice
dissent countered that localities will always be able to manufac-
ture a plausible public purpose, so that the majority opinion leaves
the vast majority of private parcels subject to condemnation when
a higher-valued use is desired.617 Backing off from the Court’s past
endorsements in Berman and Midkiff of a public use/police power
equation, the dissenters referred to the “errant language” of these
decisions, which was “unnecessary” to their holdings.618

Just Compensation
    “When . . . [the] power [of eminent domain] is exercised it can
only be done by giving the party whose property is taken or whose
use and enjoyment of such property is interfered with, full and ad-
equate compensation, not excessive or exorbitant, but just compen-
sation.” 619 The Fifth Amendment’s guarantee “that private prop-
erty shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation
was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to
bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be
borne by the public as a whole.” 620
    The just compensation required by the Constitution is that which
constitutes “a full and perfect equivalent for the property taken.” 621

States v. Cors, 337 U.S. 325, 332 (1949). There is no constitutional prohibition against
confiscation of enemy property, but aliens not so denominated are entitled to the
protection of this clause. Compare United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S.

protections for such aliens may be invoked, however, only “when they have come

this country.” United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 271 (1990).
