evidence of confessions which are involuntary, i.e., the product of
coercion, either physical or psychological, cannot stand. This is so
not because such confessions are unlikely to be true but because
the methods used to extract them offend an underlying principle in
the enforcement of our criminal law: that ours is an accusatorial
and not an inquisitorial system—a system in which the State must
establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured and
may not by coercion prove its charges against an accused out of his
own mouth.” Nevertheless, Justice Frankfurter said in another case,
“[n]o single litmus-paper test for constitutionally impermissible in-
terrogation has been evolved.” 324 Three years later, in Malloy v. Ho-
gan,325 in the process of applying the Self-Incrimination Clause to
the states, Justice Brennan for the Court reinterpreted the line of
cases since Brown v. Mississippi 326 to conclude that the Court had
initially based its rulings on the common-law confession rationale,
but that, beginning with Lisenba v. California,327 a “federal stan-
dard” had been developed. The Court had engaged in a “shift [that]
reflects recognition that the American system of criminal prosecu-
tion is accusatorial, not inquisitorial, and that the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege is its essential mainstay.” Today, continued Justice
Brennan, “the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal pros-
ecution is tested by the same standard applied in federal prosecu-
tions since 1897,” when Bram v. United States had announced that
the Self-Incrimination Clause furnished the basis for admitting or
excluding evidence in federal courts.328
     One week after the decision in Malloy v. Hogan, the Court de-
fined the rules of admissibility of confessions in different terms: al-
though it continued to emphasize voluntariness, it did so in self-
incrimination terms rather than in due process terms. In Escobedo
v. Illinois,329 it held inadmissible a confession obtained from a sus-
pect in custody who repeatedly had requested and been refused an
opportunity to consult with his retained counsel, who was at the

     324 Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 601 (1961). The same thought in-

forms the options of the Court in Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503 (1963).
     325 378 U.S. 1 (1964).
     326 297 U.S. 278 (1936).
     327 314 U.S. 219 (1941).
     328 Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 6–7 (1964). Protesting that this was “post facto

reasoning at best,” Justice Harlan contended that the “majority is simply wrong” in
asserting that any of the state confession cases represented anything like a self-
incrimination basis for the conclusions advanced. Id. at 17–19. Bram v. United States,
168 U.S. 532 (1897), is discussed under “Confessions: Police Interrogation, Due Pro-
cess, and Self-Incrimination,” supra.
     329 378 U.S. 478 (1964). Joining Justice Goldberg in the majority were Chief Jus-

tice Warren and Justices Black, Douglas, and Brennan. Justices Clark, Harlan, Stew-
art, and White dissented. Id. at 492, 493, 495.
