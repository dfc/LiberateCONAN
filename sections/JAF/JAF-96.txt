clause and it provides no guaranty against discriminatory legisla-
tion by Congress.” 486 Nevertheless, “Equal protection analysis in the
Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth
Amendment.” 487 Even before the Court reached this position, it had
assumed that “discrimination, if gross enough, is equivalent to con-
fiscation and subject under the Fifth Amendment to challenge and
annulment.” 488 The theory that was to prevail seems first to have
been enunciated by Chief Justice Taft, who observed that the Due
Process and Equal Protection Clauses are “associated” and that “[i]t
may be that they overlap, that a violation of one may involve at
times the violation of the other, but the spheres of the protection
they offer are not coterminous. . . . [Due process] tends to secure
equality of law in the sense that it makes a required minimum of
protection for every one’s right of life, liberty and property, which
the Congress or the legislature may not withhold. Our whole sys-
tem of law is predicated on the general, fundamental principle of
equality of application of the law.” 489 Thus, in Bolling v. Sharpe,490
a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education,491 the Court held
that segregation of pupils in the public schools of the District of
Columbia violated the Due Process Clause. “The Fifth Amendment,
which is applicable in the District of Columbia, does not contain an
equal protection clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment which
applies only to the states. But the concepts of equal protection and
due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness,
are not mutually exclusive. The ‘equal protection of the laws’ is a
more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than ‘due process
of law,’ and, therefore, we do not imply that the two are always
interchangeable phrases. But, as this Court has recognized, discrimi-
nation may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.”
     “Although the Court has not assumed to define ‘liberty’ with any
great precision, that term is not confined to mere freedom from bodily
restraint. Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct

lier utilized its supervisory authority over the lower federal courts and its power to
construe statutes to reach results it might have based on the Equal Protection Clause
if the cases had come from the states. E.g., Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24 (1948); Steele
v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., 323 U.S. 192 (1944); Railroad Trainmen v. Howard,
