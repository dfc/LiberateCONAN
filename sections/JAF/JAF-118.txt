poraneously with the taking.” 633 If the owner and the government
enter into a contract which stipulates the purchase price for lands
to be taken, with no provision for interest, the Fifth Amendment is
inapplicable and the landowner cannot recover interest even though
payment of the purchase price is delayed.634 Where property of a
citizen has been mistakenly seized by the government and it is con-
verted into money which is invested, the owner is entitled in recov-
ering compensation to an allowance for the use of his property.635
     Rights for Which Compensation Must Be Made.—If real prop-
erty is condemned the market value of that property must be paid
to the owner. But there are many kinds of property and many uses
of property which cause problems in computing just compensation.
It is not only the full fee simple interest in land that is compens-
able “property,” 636 but also such lesser interests as easements 637
and leaseholds. If only a portion of a tract is taken, the owner’s
compensation includes any element of value arising out of the rela-
tion of the part taken to the entire tract.638 On the other hand, if
the taking has in fact benefitted the owner, the benefit may be set
off against the value of the land condemned,639 although any sup-
posed benefit which the owner may receive in common with all from
the public use to which the property is appropriated may not be
set off.640 When certain lands were condemned for park purposes,
with resulting benefits set off against the value of the property taken,
the subsequent erection of a fire station on the property instead was
held not to have deprived the owner of any part of his just compen-
sation.641
    Interests in intangible as well as tangible property are subject
to protection under the Taking Clause. Thus compensation must be
paid for the taking of contract rights,642 patent rights,643 and trade
