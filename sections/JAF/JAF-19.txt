entitled to deference. This approach perhaps rehabilitates the re-
sult if not the reasoning in Gori and maintains the result and much
of the reasoning of Jorn.88
     Of course, “a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily
assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defen-
dant’s motion is necessitated by a prosecutorial or judicial error.” 89
“Such a motion by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate elec-
tion on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or inno-
cence determined before the first trier of fact.” 90 In United States
v. Dinitz,91 the trial judge had excluded defendant’s principal attor-
ney for misbehavior and had then given defendant the option of re-
cess while he appealed the exclusion, a mistrial, or continuation with
an assistant defense counsel. Holding that the defendant could be
retried after he chose a mistrial, the Court reasoned that, although
the exclusion might have been in error, it was not done in bad faith
to goad the defendant into requesting a mistrial or to prejudice his
prospects for acquittal. The defendant’s choice, even though diffi-
cult, to terminate the trial and go on to a new trial should be re-
spected and a new trial not barred. To hold otherwise would neces-
sitate requiring the defendant to shoulder the burden and anxiety
of proceeding to a probable conviction followed by an appeal, which
if successful would lead to a new trial, and neither the public inter-
est nor the defendant’s interests would thereby be served.
     But the Court has also reserved the possibility that the defen-
dant’s motion might be necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial over-
reaching motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or preju-
dice, and in those cases retrial would be barred. It was unclear what
prosecutorial or judicial misconduct would constitute such overreach-
ing,92 but, in Oregon v. Kennedy,93 the Court adopted a narrow “in-
tent” test, so that “[o]nly where the governmental conduct in ques-
tion is intended to ‘goad’ the defendant into moving for a mistrial

     93 456 U.S. 667, 676 (1982). The Court thought a broader standard requiring an

loath to grant motions for mistrials knowing that reprosecution would be barred. Id.
