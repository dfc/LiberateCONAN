least burdensome means to accomplish its goal.” 470 A closely di-
vided Court earlier ruled that, in time of war, the deportation of an
enemy alien may be ordered summarily by executive action; due
process of law does not require the courts to determine the suffi-
ciency of any hearing that is gratuitously afforded to the alien.471
    Judicial Review of Administrative or Military Proceed-
ings.—To the extent that constitutional rights are involved, due pro-
cess of law imports a judicial review of the action of administrative
or executive officers. This proposition is undisputed so far as ques-
tions of law are concerned, but the extent to which the courts should
and will go in reviewing determinations of fact has been a highly
controversial issue. In St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States,472
the Court held that, upon review of an order of the Secretary of
Agriculture establishing maximum rates for services rendered by a
stockyard company, due process required that the court exercise its
independent judgment upon the facts to determine whether the rates
were confiscatory.473 Subsequent cases sustaining rate orders of the
Federal Power Commission have not dealt explicitly with this point.474
The Court has said simply that a person assailing such an order
“carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it
is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its conse-
quences.” 475
    There has been a division on the Court with regard to what
extent, if at all, proceedings before military tribunals should be re-
viewed by the courts for the purpose of determining compliance with
the Due Process Clause. In In re Yamashita,476 the majority denied
a petition for certiorari and petitions for writs of habeas corpus to
review the conviction of a Japanese war criminal by a military com-
mission sitting in the Philippine Islands. It held that, because the
military commission, in admitting evidence to which objection had
been made, had not violated any act of Congress, a treaty, or a mili-
tary command defining its authority, its ruling on evidence and on
the mode of conducting the proceedings were not reviewable by the
     470 538 U.S. at 528. There was disagreement among the Justices as to whether

existing procedures afforded the alien an opportunity for individualized determina-
tion of danger to society and risk of flight.
     471 Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160 (1948). Three of the four dissenting Jus-

tices, Douglas, Murphy, and Rutledge, argued that even an enemy alien could not
be deported without a fair hearing.
     472 298 U.S. 38 (1936).
     473 298 U.S. at 51–54. Justices Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo, although concur-

ring in the result, took exception to this proposition.
     474 FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591 (1944); FPC v. Natural Gas Pipe-

line Co., 315 U.S. 575, 586 (1941).
     475 FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 602 (1944).
     476 327 U.S. 1 (1946).
