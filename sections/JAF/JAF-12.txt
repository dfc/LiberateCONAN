the laws of more than one unit.52 Although the Court had long ac-
cepted in dictum the principle that prosecution by two govern-
ments of the same defendant for the same conduct would not con-
stitute double jeopardy, it was not until United States v. Lanza 53
that the conviction in federal court of a person previously convicted
in a state court for performing the same acts was sustained. “We
have here two sovereignties, deriving power from different sources,
capable of dealing with the same subject-matter within the same
territory. . . . Each government in determining what shall be an of-
fense against its peace and dignity is exercising its own sover-
eignty, not that of the other.” 54 The “dual sovereignty” doctrine is
not only tied into the existence of two sets of laws often serving
different federal-state purposes and the now overruled principle that
the Double Jeopardy Clause restricts only the national government
and not the states,55 but it also reflects practical considerations that
undesirable consequences could follow an overruling of the doc-
trine. Thus, a state might preempt federal authority by first pros-
ecuting and providing for a lenient sentence (as compared to the
possible federal sentence) or acquitting defendants who had the sym-
pathy of state authorities as against federal law enforcement.56 The
application of the clause to the states has therefore worked no change
in the “dual sovereign” doctrine.57 The dual sovereignty doctrine has
also been applied to permit successive prosecutions by two states

     52 The problem was recognized as early as Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.)

1 (1820), and the rationale of the doctrine was confirmed within thirty years. Fox v.
Ohio, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 410 (1847); United States v. Marigold, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 560
(1850); Moore v. Illinois, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 13 (1852).
     53 260 U.S. 377 (1922).
     54 260 U.S. at 382. See also Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312 (1924); Screws v.

United States, 325 U.S. 91, 108 (1945); Jerome v. United States, 318 U.S. 101 (1943).
     55 Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), extended the clause to the states.
     56 Reaffirmation of the doctrine against double jeopardy claims as to the Fed-

eral Government and against due process claims as to the states occurred in Abbate
v. United States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959), and Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959),
both cases containing extensive discussion and policy analyses. The Justice Depart-
ment follows a policy of generally not duplicating a state prosecution brought and
carried out in good faith, see Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 531 (1960); Rinaldi
v. United States, 434 U.S. 22 (1977), and several provisions of federal law forbid a
federal prosecution following a state prosecution. E.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 659, 660, 1992,
2117. The Brown Commission recommended a general statute to this effect, preserv-
ing discretion in federal authorities to proceed upon certification by the Attorney
General that a United States interest would be unduly harmed if there were no
federal prosecution. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON REFORM OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS, FINAL
REPORT 707 (1971).
     57 United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313 (1978) (dual sovereignty doctrine per-

mits federal prosecution of an Indian for statutory rape following his plea of guilty
in a tribal court to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, both charges involv-
ing the same conduct; tribal law stemmed from the retained sovereignty of the tribe
and did not flow from the Federal Government).
