sentencing him to imprisonment only.136 But the Court has held that
the imposition of a sentence does not from the moment of imposi-
tion have the finality that a judgment of acquittal has. Thus, it has
long been recognized that in the same term of court and before the
defendant has begun serving the sentence the court may recall him
and increase his sentence.137 Moreover, a defendant who is retried
after he is successful in overturning his first conviction is not pro-
tected by the Double Jeopardy Clause against receiving a greater
sentence upon his second conviction.138 An exception exists with re-
spect to capital punishment, the Court having held that govern-
ment may not again seek the death penalty on retrial when on the
first trial the jury had declined to impose a death sentence.139
    Applying and modifying these principles, the Court narrowly ap-
proved the constitutionality of a statutory provision for sentencing
of “dangerous special offenders,” which authorized prosecution ap-
peals of sentences and permitted the appellate court to affirm, re-
duce, or increase the sentence.140 The Court held that the provi-
sion did not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause. Sentences had never
carried the finality that attached to acquittal, and its precedents

    137  Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160 (1947). See also Pollard v. United States,
352 U.S. 354, 359–60 (1957) (imposition of prison sentence two years after court
imposed an invalid sentence of probation approved). Dicta in some cases had cast
doubt on the constitutionality of the practice. United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304,
307 (1931). However, United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 133–36, 138–39
(1980), upholding a statutory provision allowing the United States to appeal a sen-
tence imposed on a “dangerous special offender,” removes any doubt on that score.
The Court there reserved decision on whether the government may appeal a sen-
tence that the defendant has already begun to serve.
     138 North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 719–21 (1969). See also Chaffin v.

Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 23–24 (1973). The principle of implicit acquittal of an
offense drawn from Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184 (1957), does not similarly
apply to create an implicit acquittal of a higher sentence. Pearce does hold that a
defendant must be credited with the time served against his new sentence. 395 U.S.

     139 Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981). Four Justices dissented. Id. at

447 (Justices Powell, White, Rehnquist, and Chief Justice Burger). The Court disap-
proved Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15 (1919), although formally distinguish-
ing it. Bullington was followed in Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203 (1984), also in-
volving a separate sentencing proceeding in which a life imprisonment sentence
amounted to an acquittal on imposition of the death penalty. Rumsey was decided
by 7–2 vote, with only Justices White and Rehnquist dissenting. In Monge v. Califor-
nia, 524 U.S. 721 (1998), the Court refused to extend the “narrow” Bullington excep-
tion outside the area of capital punishment. But see Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537
U.S. 101 (2003) (state may seek the death penalty in a retrial when defendant ap-
pealed following discharge of the sentencing jury under a statute authorizing dis-
charge based on the court’s “opinion that further deliberation would not result in a
unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the
defendant to life imprisonment”).
     140 United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117 (1980). Four Justices dissented.

Id. at 143, 152 (Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Stevens).
