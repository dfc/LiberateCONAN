ment ceases. If the suspect is thereafter put into custody again, the
options for questioning no longer are limited to suspect-initiated talks
or providing counsel, but rather the police may issue new Miranda
warnings and proceed accordingly.379 Moreover, the Edwards rule
has not been explicitly extended to other aspects of the Miranda
warnings.380
    Fifth, a properly warned suspect may waive his Miranda rights
and submit to custodial interrogation. Miranda recognized that a
suspect may voluntarily and knowingly give up his rights and re-
spond to questioning, but the Court also cautioned that the prosecu-
tion bore a “heavy burden” to establish that a valid waiver had oc-
curred.381 The Court continued: “[a] valid waiver will not be presumed
simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or
simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob-
tained.” 382 Subsequent cases indicated that determining whether a
suspect has waived his Miranda rights is a fact-specific inquiry not
easily susceptible to per se rules. According to these cases, resolu-
tion of the issue of waiver “must be determined on ‘the particular
facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the back-
ground, experience, and conduct of the accused.’ ” 383 Under this line

423 U.S. 96 (1975) (suspect given Miranda warnings at questioning for robbery, re-
quested cessation of interrogation, and police complied; some two hours later, a dif-
ferent policeman interrogated suspect about a murder, gave him a new Miranda warn-
ing, and suspect made incriminating admission; since police “scrupulously honored”
suspect’s request, admission valid).
     381 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 475 (1966). See also Tague v. Louisiana,

444 U.S. 469 (1980). A knowing and intelligent waiver need not be predicated on
complete disclosure by police of the intended line of questioning, hence an accused’s
signed waiver following arrest for one crime is not invalidated by police having failed
to inform him of intent to question him about another crime. Colorado v. Spring,

     383 North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 374–75 (1979) (quoting Johnson v.

Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)). In Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985), the Court
held that a confession following a Miranda warning is not necessarily tainted by an
earlier confession obtained without a warning, as long as the earlier confession had
been voluntary. See Bobby v. Dixon, 565 U.S. ___, No. 10–1540, slip op. (2012). See
also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412 (1986) (signed waivers following Miranda warn-
ings not vitiated by police having kept from suspect information that attorney had
been retained for him by a relative); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707 (1979) (juve-
nile who consented to interrogation after his request to consult with his probation
officer was denied found to have waived rights; totality-of-the-circumstances analy-
sis held to apply). Elstad was distinguished in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600
(2004), however, when the failure to warn prior to the initial questioning was a de-
liberate attempt to circumvent Miranda by use of a two-step interrogation tech-
nique, and the police, prior to eliciting the statement for the second time, did not
alert the suspect that the first statement was likely inadmissible.
