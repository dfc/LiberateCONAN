was the English practice and that Coke had indicated that it was a
proceeding required as “the law of the land.” The Court in Mur-
ray’s Lessee meant “that a process of law, which is not otherwise
forbidden, must be taken to be due process of law, if it can show
the sanction of settled usage both in England and in this country;
but it by no means follows that nothing else can be due process of
law.” To hold that only historical, traditional procedures can consti-
tute due process, the Court said, “would be to deny every quality of
the law but its age, and to render it incapable of progress or im-
provement.” 435 Therefore, the Court concluded, due process “must
be held to guarantee not particular forms of procedures, but the
very substance of individual rights to life, liberty, and property.” The
Due Process Clause prescribed “the limits of those fundamental prin-
ciples of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and
political institutions. . . . It follows that any legal proceeding en-
forced by public authority, whether sanctioned by age and custom,
or newly devised in the discretion of the legislative power, in fur-
therance of the general public good, which regards and preserves
these principles of liberty and justice, must be held to be due pro-
cess of law.” 436
     Generally.—The phrase “due process of law” does not necessar-
ily imply a proceeding in a court or a plenary suit and trial by jury
in every case where personal or property rights are involved.437 “In
all cases, that kind of procedure is due process of law which is suit-
able and proper to the nature of the case, and sanctioned by the
established customs and usages of the courts.” 438 What is unfair in
one situation may be fair in another.439 “The precise nature of the
interest that has been adversely affected, the manner in which this
was done, the reasons for doing it, the available alternatives to the
procedure that was followed, the protection implicit in the office of
the functionary whose conduct is challenged, the balance of hurt
complained of and good accomplished—these are some of the con-
siderations that must enter into the judicial judgment.” 440
