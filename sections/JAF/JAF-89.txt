type hearing in every conceivable case of governmental impair-
ment of private interest.453 Because the Civil Rights Commission
acts solely as an investigative and fact-finding agency and makes
no adjudications, the Court, in Hannah v. Larche,454 upheld supple-

     453 Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Four dis-

senters, Justices Brennan, Black, Douglas, and Chief Justice Warren, emphasized
the inconsistency between the Court’s acknowledgment that the cook had a right
not to have her entry badge taken away for arbitrary reasons, and its rejection of
her right to be told in detail the reasons for such action. The case has subsequently
been cited as involving an “extraordinary situation.” Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S.
371, 379 (1971); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 264 n.10 (1970).
     Manifesting a disposition to adjudicate on non-constitutional grounds dismiss-
als of employees under the Federal Loyalty Program, the Court, in Peters v. Hobby,
349 U.S. 331 (1955), invalidated, as in excess of its delegated authority, a finding of
reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the petitioner by a Loyalty Review Board which,
on its own initiative, reopened his case after he had twice been cleared by his Agency
Loyalty Board, and arrived at its conclusion on the basis of adverse information not
offered under oath and supplied by informants, not all of whom were known to the
Review Board and none of whom was disclosed to petitioner for cross-examination
by him. The Board was found not to possess any power to review on its own initia-
tive. Concurring, Justices Douglas and Black condemned as irreconcilable with due
process and fair play the use of faceless informers whom the petitioner is unable to
confront and cross-examine.
     In Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536 (1956), also decided on the basis of statutory
interpretation, there is an intimation that grave due process issues would be raised
by the application to federal employees, not occupying sensitive positions, of a mea-
sure which authorized, in the interest of national security, summary suspensions
and unreviewable dismissals of allegedly disloyal employees by agency heads. In Ser-
vice v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363 (1957), and Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535 (1959), the
Court nullified dismissals for security reasons by invoking an established rule of
administrative law to the effect that an administrator must comply with procedures
outlined in applicable agency regulations, notwithstanding that such regulations con-
form to more rigorous substantive and procedural standards than are required by
Congress or that the agency action is discretionary in nature. In both of the last
cited decisions, dismissals of employees as security risks were set aside by reason of
the failure of the employing agency to conform the dismissal to its established secu-
rity regulations. See Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954).
     Again avoiding constitutional issues, the Court, in Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S.
474 (1959), invalidated the security clearance procedure required of defense contrac-
tors by the Defense Department as being unauthorized either by law or presidential
order. However, the Court suggested that it would condemn, on grounds of denial of
due process, any enactment or Executive Order which sanctioned a comparable de-
partment security clearance program, under which a defense contractor’s employee
could have his security clearance revoked without a hearing at which he had the
right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Justices Frankfurter, Harlan, and Whit-
taker concurred without passing on the validity of such procedure, if authorized.
Justice Clark dissented. See also the dissenting opinions of Justices Douglas and
Black in Beard v. Stahr, 370 U.S. 41, 43 (1962), and in Williams v. Zuckert, 371
U.S. 531, 533 (1963).
     454 363 U.S. 420, 493, 499 (1960). Justices Douglas and Black dissented on the

ground that when the Commission summons a person accused of violating a federal
election law with a view to ascertaining whether the accusation may be sustained,
it acts in lieu of a grand jury or a committing magistrate, and therefore should be
obligated to afford witnesses the procedural protection herein denied. Congress sub-
sequently amended the law to require that any person who is defamed, degraded, or
incriminated by evidence or testimony presented to the Commission be afforded the
