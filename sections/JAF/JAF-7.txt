     Besides indictments, grand juries may also issue reports that
may indicate nonindictable misbehavior, mis- or malfeasance of pub-
lic officers, or other objectionable conduct.14 Despite the vast power
of grand juries, there is little in the way of judicial or legislative
response designed to impose some supervisory restrictions on them.15
     Within the meaning of this article a crime is made “infamous”
by the quality of the punishment that may be imposed.16 “What pun-
ishments shall be considered as infamous may be affected by the
changes of public opinion from one age to another.” 17 Imprison-
ment in a state prison or penitentiary, with or without hard la-
bor,18 or imprisonment at hard labor in the workhouse of the Dis-
trict of Columbia,19 falls within this category. The pivotal question
is whether the offense is one for which the court is authorized to
award such punishment; the sentence actually imposed is immate-
rial. “When the accused is in danger of being subjected to an infa-
mous punishment if convicted, he has the right to insist that he
shall not be put upon his trial, except on the accusation of a grand
jury.” 20 Thus, an act that authorized imprisonment at hard labor
for one year, as well as deportation, of Chinese aliens found to be
unlawfully within the United States, created an offense that could
be tried only upon indictment.21 Counterfeiting,22 fraudulent altera-
tion of poll books,23 fraudulent voting,24 and embezzlement,25 have
been declared to be infamous crimes. It is immaterial how Con-

inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions
of propriety or forecasts of whether any particular individual will be found properly
subject to an accusation of crime.” Blair v. United States, 250 U.S. 273, 281 (1919).
On the reports function of the grand jury, see In re Grand Jury January, 1969, 315
F. Supp. 662 (D. Md. 1970), and Report of the January 1970 Grand Jury (Black
Panther Shooting) (N.D. Ill., released May 15, 1970). Congress has now specifically
authorized issuance of reports in cases concerning public officers and organized crime.
18 U.S.C. § 333.
     15 Congress has required that in the selection of federal grand juries, as well as

petit juries, random selection of a fair cross section of the community is to take place,
and has provided a procedure for challenging discriminatory selection by moving to
dismiss the indictment. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1861–68. Racial discrimination in selection of
juries is constitutionally proscribed in both state and federal courts. See discussion
