the same transaction unless Congress has “spoken in language that
is clear and definite” 147 to pronounce its intent that multiple pun-
ishments indeed be imposed. The commonly used test in determin-
ing whether Congress would have wanted to punish as separate of-
fenses conduct occurring in the same transaction, absent otherwise
clearly expressed intent, is the “same evidence” rule. The rule, an-
nounced in Blockburger v. United States,148 “is that where the same
act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory
provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are
two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof
of a fact which the other does not.” Thus, in Gore v. United States,149
the Court held that defendant’s one act of selling narcotics had vio-
lated three distinct criminal statutes, each of which required proof
of a fact not required by the others; prosecuting him on all three
counts in the same proceeding was therefore permissible.150 So too,
the same evidence rule does not upset the “established doctrine”
that, for double jeopardy purposes, “a conspiracy to commit a crime
is a separate offense from the crime itself,” 151 or the related prin-
ciple that Congress may prescribe that predicate offenses and “con-
tinuing criminal enterprise” are separate offenses.152 On the other
hand, in Whalen v. United States,153 the Court determined that a
defendant could not be separately punished for rape and for killing
the same victim in the perpetration of the rape, because it is not

but it derived the rule from Gavieres v. United States, 220 U.S. 338, 342 (1911),
which was a double jeopardy case. See also Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365 (1902);

conspiracy to commit a crime when the nature of the crime necessitates participa-
tion of two or more persons for its commission; Court recognized Wharton’s Rule as
a double-jeopardy inspired presumption of legislative intent but held that congres-
sional intent in this case was “clear and unmistakable” that both offenses be pun-

criminal enterprise offense under 21 U.S.C. § 848, so there are not two separate of-
