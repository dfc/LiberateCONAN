    Although the Court’s decision rapidly became highly controver-
sial and the source of much political agitation, including playing a
prominent role in the 1968 presidential election, the Court has con-
tinued to adhere to it,336 albeit not without considerable qualifica-
tion. Nevertheless, the constitutional status of the Miranda warn-
ings has remained clouded in uncertainty. Had the Court announced
a constitutionally compelled rule, or merely a supervisory rule that
could be superseded by statute? In 1968, Congress enacted a stat-
ute, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3501, designed to set aside Miranda in
the federal courts and to reinstate the traditional voluntariness test.337
The statute lay unimplemented, for the most part, due to constitu-
tional doubts about it. Meanwhile, the Court created exceptions to
the Miranda warnings over the years, and referred to the warn-
ings as “prophylactic” 338 and “not themselves rights protected by
the Constitution.” 339 There were even hints that some Justices might
be willing to overrule the decision.
     In Dickerson v. United States,340 the Court addressed the foun-
dational issue, finding that Miranda was a “constitutional deci-
sion” that could not be overturned by statute, and consequently that
18 U.S.C. § 3501, which provided for a less strict “voluntariness”
standard for the admissibility of confessions, could not be sus-
tained. Consistent application of Miranda warnings to state proceed-
ings necessarily implied a constitutional base, the Court explained,
since federal courts “hold no supervisory authority over state judi-
cial proceedings.” 341 Moreover, Miranda itself had purported to “give
concrete constitutional guidance to law enforcement agencies and
courts to follow.” 342 The two dissenting Justices in Dickerson main-
tained that the majority’s characterization of Miranda as providing
concrete constitutional guidance fell short of holding that custodial
interrogation not preceded by Miranda warnings was unconstitu-
tional, a position with which the dissenters pointedly disagreed.343

lina, the number of Justices asserting that Miranda was not a con-

ment practices have adjusted to its strictures; I would neither overrule Miranda,
disparage it, nor extend it at this late date.”)
