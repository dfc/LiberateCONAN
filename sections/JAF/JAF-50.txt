    Congress thereupon enacted a statute replacing all prior immu-
nity statutes and adopting a use-immunity restriction only.249 Soon
tested, this statute was sustained in Kastigar v. United States.250
“[P]rotection coextensive with the privilege is the degree of protec-
tion which the Constitution requires,” wrote Justice Powell for the
Court, “and is all that the Constitution requires. . . .” 251 “Transac-
tional immunity, which accords full immunity from prosecution for
the offense to which the compelled testimony relates, affords the
witness considerably broader protection than does the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege. The privilege has never been construed to mean that
one who invokes it cannot subsequently be prosecuted. Its sole con-
cern is to afford protection against being ‘forced to give testimony
leading to the infliction of penalties affixed to . . . criminal acts.’
Immunity from the use of compelled testimony and evidence de-
rived directly and indirectly therefrom affords this protection. It pro-
hibits the prosecutorial authorities from using the compelled testi-
mony in any respect, and it therefore insures that the testimony
cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the wit-
ness.” 252



     249 Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. 91–452, § 201(a), 84 Stat. 922,

18 U.S.C. §§ 6002–6003. Justice Department officials have the authority under the
Act to decide whether to seek immunity, and courts will not apply “constructive”
use immunity absent compliance with the statute’s procedures. United States v. Doe,
465 U.S. 605 (1984).
     250 406 U.S. 441 (1972). A similar state statute was sustained in Zicarelli v. New

Jersey State Comm’n of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472 (1972).
     251 Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 459 (1972). See also United States

v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000) (because the statute protects against derivative use
of compelled testimony, a prosecution cannot be based on incriminating evidence re-
vealed only as the result of compliance with an extremely broad subpoena).
     252 406 U.S. at 453. Joining Justice Powell in the opinion were Justices Stew-

art, White, and Blackmun, and Chief Justice Burger. Justices Douglas and Mar-
shall dissented, contending that a ban on use could not be enforced even if a use
ban was constitutionally adequate. Id. at 462, 467. Justices Brennan and Rehnquist
did not participate but Justice Brennan’s views that transactional immunity was
required had been previously stated. Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U.S. 548, 552 (1971)
(dissenting). See also New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 451 (1979) (prosecution use of
defendant’s immunized testimony to impeach him at trial violates Self-
Incrimination Clause). Neither the clause nor the statute prevents the perjury pros-
ecution of an immunized witness or the use of all his testimony to prove the commis-
sion of perjury. United States v. Apfelbaum, 445 U.S. 115 (1980). See also United
States v. Wong, 431 U.S. 174 (1977); United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976).
Because use immunity is limited, a witness granted use immunity for grand jury
testimony may validly invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in a civil deposition
proceeding when asked whether he had “so testified” previously, the deposition tes-
timony not being covered by the earlier immunity. Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.
248 (1983).
