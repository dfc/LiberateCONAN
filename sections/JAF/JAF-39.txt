claim is required is deemed to have waived it, and waiver may be
found where the witness has answered some preliminary questions
but desires to stop at a certain point.189 However, an assertion of
innocence in conjunction with a claim of the privilege does not ob-
viate the right of a witness to invoke it, as her responses still may
provide the government with evidence it may later seek to use against
her.190
    Though an individual must have reasonable cause to appre-
hend danger and cannot be the judge of the validity of his claim, a
court that would deny a claim of the privilege must be “ ‘perfectly
clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the
case, that the individual is mistaken, and that the answer[s] can-
not possibly have such tendency to incriminate.” 191 To reach a de-
termination, furthermore, a trial judge may not require a witness
to disclose so much of the danger as to render the privilege nuga-
tory: “[I]f the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to
prove the hazard . . . he would be compelled to surrender the very
protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee. To sustain
the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the
question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive an-
swer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be an-
swered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could re-
sult.” 192
   The privilege against self-incrimination is a personal one and
cannot be used by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corpo-
indicated guilt, and a majority of the Court endorsed these comments. The four dis-
senting Justices inferred from Salinas’s silence and the surrounding circumstances
that he had exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege, and they would have barred
the prosecutor’s remarks.
     189 Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367 (1951); United States v. Monia, 317

U.S. 424 (1943). The “waiver” concept here has been pronounced “analytically [un-
]sound,” with the Court preferring to reserve the term “waiver” “for the process by
which one affirmatively renounces the protection of the privilege.” Garner v. United
States, 424 U.S. 648, 654, n.9 (1976). Thus, the Court has settled upon the concept
of “compulsion” as applied to “cases where disclosures are required in the face of
claim of privilege.” Id. “[I]n the ordinary case, if a witness under compulsion to tes-
tify makes disclosures instead of claiming the privilege, the government has not ‘com-
pelled’ him to incriminate himself.” Id. at 654. Similarly, the Court has enunciated
the concept of “voluntariness” to be applied in situations where it is claimed that a
particular factor denied the individual a “free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse
to answer.” Id. at 654 n.9, 656–65.
     190 Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17 (2001).
     191 Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. at 488 (quoting Temple v. Common-

wealth, 75 Va. 892, 898 (1881)). For an application of these principles,see Malloy v.
Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 11–14 (1964), and id. at 33 (Justices White and Stewart dissent-
ing). Where government is seeking to enforce an essentially noncriminal statutory
scheme through compulsory disclosure, some Justices would apparently relax the
Hoffman principles. Cf. California v. Byers, 402 U.S. 424 (1971) (plurality opinion).
     192 Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. at 486–87.
