of the confession no matter what was determined with regard to
its voluntariness. The rule was reiterated in Sims v. Georgia,409 in
which the Court voided a state practice permitting the judge to let
the confession go to the jury for the ultimate decision on voluntari-
ness, upon an initial determination merely that the prosecution had
made out a prima facie case that the confession was voluntary. The
Court has interposed no constitutional objection to use of either the
orthodox or the Massachusetts method for determining admissibil-
ity.410 It has held that the prosecution bears the burden of establish-
ing voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence, rejecting a
contention that it should be determined only upon proof beyond a
reasonable doubt,411 or by clear and convincing evidence.412

                                  DUE PROCESS

History and Scope
    “It is now the settled doctrine of this Court that the Due Pro-
cess Clause embodies a system of rights based on moral principles
so deeply imbedded in the traditions and feelings of our people as
to be deemed fundamental to a civilized society as conceived by our
whole history. Due Process is that which comports with the deepest
notions of what is fair and right and just.” 413 The content of due
process is “a historical product” 414 that traces all the way back to
chapter 39 of Magna Carta, in which King John promised that “[n]o
free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized or exiled or in
any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor send upon him,
except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the
land.” 415 The phrase “due process of law” first appeared in a statu-
    409  385 U.S. 538 (1967).
    410  Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 and n.8 (1964); Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S.
477, 489–90 (1972) (rejecting contention that jury should be required to pass on
voluntariness following judge’s determination).
     411 Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477 (1972).
     412 Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986).
     413 Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U.S. 9, 16 (1950) (Justice Frankfurter dissenting).

Due process is violated if a practice or rule “offends some principle of justice so rooted
in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” Sny-
der v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934).
     414 Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U.S. 22, 31 (1922).

CARTA: A COMMENTARY ON THE GREAT CHARTER OF KING JOHN 375–95 (Glasgow, 2d rev. ed.
1914). The chapter became chapter 29 in the Third Reissue of Henry III in 1225. Id.
at 504, and see 139–59. As expanded, it read: “No free man shall be taken or impris-
oned or deprived of his freehold or his liberties or free customs, or outlawed or ex-
iled, or in any manner destroyed, nor shall we come upon him or send against him,
except by a legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.” See also J. HOLT,
MAGNA CARTA 226–29 (1965). The 1225 reissue also added to chapter 29 the language
of chapter 40 of the original text: “To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or
delay right or justice.” This 1225 reissue became the standard text thereafter.
