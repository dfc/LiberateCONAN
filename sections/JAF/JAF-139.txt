Palazzolo v. Rhode Island,755 for example, the Court saw no point
in requiring the landowner to apply for approval of a scaled-down
development of his wetland, since the regulations at issue made plain
that no development at all would be permitted there. “[O]nce it be-
comes clear that the agency lacks the discretion to permit any de-
velopment, or the permissible uses of the property are known to a
reasonable degree of certainty, a takings claim is likely to have rip-
ened.” 756
     Facial challenges dispense with the Williamson County final de-
cision prerequisite, though at great risk to the plaintiff in that, with-
out pursuing administrative remedies, a claimant often lacks evi-
dence that a statute has the requisite economic impact on his or
her property.757
     The requirement that state remedies be exhausted before bring-
ing a federal taking claim to federal court has occasioned countless
dismissals of takings claims brought initially in federal court, while
at the same time posing a bar under doctrines of preclusion to fil-
ing first in state court, per Williamson County, then relitigating in
federal court. The effect in many cases is to keep federal takings
claims out of federal court entirely—a consequence the plaintiffs’
bar has long argued could not have been intended by the Court. In
San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco,758 the
Court unanimously declined to create an exception to the federal
full faith and credit statute 759 that would allow relitigation of fed-
eral takings claims in federal court. Nor, said the Court, may an
England reservation of the federal taking claim in state court 760
be used to require a federal court to review the reserved claim, re-
gardless of what issues the state court may have decided. While

her transferrable development rights, because no discretion remains to agency and
value of such rights is a simple issue of fact).

have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States . . . as
they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . .” The statute has been
held to encompass the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion.
