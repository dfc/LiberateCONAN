by alternative service, and for Congress to have so provided to make
military service more attractive.497
     “The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impar-
tially. . . . [B]ut . . . there may be overriding national interests which
justify selective federal legislation that would be unacceptable for
an individual State.” 498 The paramount federal power over immi-
gration and naturalization is the principal example, although there
are undoubtedly others, of the national government’s being able to
classify upon some grounds—alienage, naturally, but also other sus-
pect and quasi-suspect categories as well—that would result in in-
validation were a state to enact them. The instances may be rela-
tively few, but they do exist.
     Congressional Police Measures.—Numerous regulations of a
police nature, imposed under powers specifically granted to the Fed-
eral Government, have been sustained over objections based on the
Due Process Clause. Congress may require the owner of a vessel
entering United States ports, and on which alien seamen are af-
flicted with specified diseases, to bear the expense of hospitalizing
such persons.499 It may prohibit the transportation in interstate com-
merce of filled milk 500 or the importation of convict-made goods into
any state where their receipt, possession, or sale is a violation of
local law.501 It may require employers to bargain collectively with
representatives of their employees chosen in a manner prescribed
by law, to reinstate employees discharged in violation of law, and

U.S. 498 (1975) (military law that classified men more adversely than women deemed
rational because it had the effect of compensating for prior discrimination against
women). Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985) (selective prosecution of per-
sons who turned themselves in or were reported by others as having failed to regis-
ter for the draft does not deny equal protection, there being no showing that these
men were selected for prosecution because of their protest activities).
     498 Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 100 (1976). Thus, the power over

immigration and aliens permitted federal discrimination on the basis of alienage,
Hampton, supra (employment restrictions like those previously voided when im-
posed by states), durational residency, Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976) (similar
rules imposed by states previously voided), and illegitimacy, Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S.
787 (1977) (similar rules by states would be voided). Racial preferences and discrimi-
nations in immigration have had a long history, e.g., The Chinese Exclusion Case,
130 U.S. 581 (1889), and the power continues today, e.g., Dunn v. INS, 499 F.2d
856, 858 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1106 (1975); Narenji v. Civiletti, 617
F.2d 745, 748 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 957 (1980), although Congress
has removed most such classifications from the statute books.
