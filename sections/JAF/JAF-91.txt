aliens justifies delegation of power to executive officers to enforce
the exclusion of aliens afflicted with contagious diseases by impos-
ing upon the owner of the vessel bringing any such alien into the
country a money penalty, collectible before and as a condition of the
grant of clearance.458 If the person seeking admission claims Ameri-
can citizenship, the decision of the Secretary of Labor may be made
final, but it must be made after a fair hearing, however summary,
and must find adequate support in the evidence. A decision based
upon a record from which relevant and probative evidence has been
omitted is not a fair hearing.459 Where the statute made the deci-
sion of an immigration inspector final unless an appeal was taken
to the Secretary of the Treasury, a person who failed to take such
an appeal did not, by an allegation of citizenship, acquire a right
to a judicial hearing on habeas corpus.460
    Procedural due process rights are more in evidence when it comes
to deportation or other proceedings brought against aliens already
within the country. Deportation proceedings are not criminal pros-
ecutions within the meaning of the Bill of Rights.461 The authority
to deport is drawn from the power of Congress to regulate the en-
trance of aliens and impose conditions upon their continued liberty
to reside within the United States. Findings of fact reached by ex-
ecutive officers after a fair, though summary, deportation hearing
may be made conclusive.462 In Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath,463 how-
    458  Oceanic Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320 (1909).
    459  Kwock Jan Fat v. White, 253 U.S. 454, 457 (1920). See also Chin Yow v. United
States, 208 U.S. 8 (1908).
     460 United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. 161 (1904). See also Quon Quon Poy v.

Johnson, 273 U.S. 352, 358 (1927).
     461 Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952). But this fact does not mean

that a person may be deported on the basis of judgment reached on the civil stan-
dard of proof, that is, by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, the Court has
held, a deportation order may only be entered if it is found by clear, unequivocal,
and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.
Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966). Woodby, and similar rulings, were the result of
statutory interpretation and were not constitutionally compelled. Vance v. Terrazas,
444 U.S. 252, 266â€“67 (1980).
     462 Zakonaite v. Wolf, 226 U.S. 272 (1912). See Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345 (1956),

in which the Court emphasized that suspension of deportation is not a matter of
right, but of grace, like probation or parole, and, accordingly, an alien is not entitled
to a hearing that contemplates full disclosure of the considerations (information of a
confidential nature pertaining to national security) that induced administrative offi-
cers to deny suspension. In four dissenting opinions, Chief Justice Warren, together
with Justices Black, Frankfurter, and Douglas, found irreconcilable with a fair hear-
ing and due process the delegation by the Attorney General of his discretion to an
inferior officer and the vesting of the latter with power to deny a suspension on the
basis of undisclosed evidence that may constitute no more than uncorroborated hear-
say.

(1960), in which the Court ruled that when, at a hearing on his petition for suspen-
sion of a deportation order, an alien invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to
