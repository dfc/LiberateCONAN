foreclosure of a mortgage was unavailing to defeat a plan for reor-
ganization of a debtor corporation where the trial court found that
the claims of junior lienholders had no value.569
    Right to Sue the Government.—A right to sue the govern-
ment on a contract is a privilege, not a property right protected by
the Constitution.570 The right to sue for recovery of taxes paid may
be conditioned upon an appeal to the Commissioner and his refusal
to refund.571 There was no denial of due process when Congress took
away the right to sue for recovery of taxes, where the claim for re-
covery was without substantial equity, having arisen from the mis-
take of administrative officials in allowing the statute of limita-
tions to run before collecting a tax.572 The denial to taxpayers of
the right to sue for refund of processing and floor stock taxes col-
lected under a law subsequently held unconstitutional, and the sub-
stitution of a new administrative procedure for the recovery of such
sums, was held valid.573 Congress may cut off the right to recover
taxes illegally collected by ratifying their imposition and collection,
where it could lawfully have authorized such exactions prior to their
collection.574
    Congressional Power to Abolish Common Law Judicial Ac-
tions.—Similarly, it is clearly settled that “[a] person has no prop-
erty, no vested interest, in any rule of the common law.” 575 It fol-
lows, therefore, that Congress in its discretion may abolish common-
law actions, replacing them with other judicial actions or with
administrative remedies at its discretion. There is slight intima-
tion in some of the cases that if Congress does abolish a common
law action it must either duplicate the recovery or provide a reason-
able substitute remedy.576 Such a holding seems only remotely likely,577
but some difficulties may be experienced with respect to legislation
that retrospectively affects rights to sue, such as shortening or length-

     576 The intimation stems from New York Cent. R.R. v. White, 243 U.S. 188 (1917)

(a state case, involving the constitutionality of a workmen’s compensation law). While
denying any person’s vested interest in the continuation of any particular right to
sue, id. at 198, the Court did seem twice to suggest that abolition without a reason-
able substitute would raise due process problems. Id. at 201. In Duke Power Co. v.
Carolina Envtl. Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 87–92 (1978), it noticed the contention
but passed it by because the law at issue was a reasonable substitute.
