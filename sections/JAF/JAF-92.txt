ever, the Court intimated that a hearing before a tribunal that did
not meet the standards of impartiality embodied in the Administra-
tive Procedure Act 464 might not satisfy the requirements of due pro-
cess of law. To avoid such constitutional doubts, the Court con-
strued the law to disqualify immigration inspectors as presiding officers
in deportation proceedings. Except in time of war, deportation with-
out a fair hearing or on charges unsupported by any evidence is a
denial of due process that may be corrected on habeas corpus.465 In
contrast with the decision in United States v. Ju Toy 466 that a per-
son seeking entrance to the United States was not entitled to a ju-
dicial hearing on his claim of citizenship, a person arrested and held
for deportation is entitled to his day in court if he denies that he is
an alien.467 Because aliens within the United States are protected
to some extent by due process, Congress must give “clear indica-
tion” of an intent to authorize indefinite detention of illegal aliens,
and probably must also cite “special justification,” as, for example,
for “suspected terrorists.” 468 In Demore v. Kim,469 however, the Court
indicated that its holding in Zadvydas was quite limited. Uphold-
ing detention of permanent resident aliens without bond pending a
determination of removability, the Court reaffirmed Congress’s broad
powers over aliens. “[W]hen the government deals with deportable
aliens, the Due Process Clause does not require it to employ the

questions as to Communist Party membership and contended that the burden of
proving such affiliation was on the government, it was incumbent on the alien to
supply the information, as the government had no statutory discretion to suspend
deportation of a Communist. Justices Douglas, Black, Brennan, and Chief Justice
Warren dissented on the ground that exercise of the privilege is a neutral act, sup-
porting neither innocence nor guilt and may not be used as evidence of dubious char-
acter. Justice Brennan also thought the government was requiring the alien to prove
non-membership when no one had intimated that he was a Communist.

Mahler v. Eby, 264 U.S. 32, 41 (1924). Although, in Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229
(1953), the Court held that a deportation order under the Immigration Act of 1917
might be challenged only by habeas corpus, in Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48
(1955), it established that, under the Immigration Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, the
validity of a deportation order also may be contested in an action for declaratory
judgment and injunctive relief. Also, a collateral challenge must be permitted to the
use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense where effective
judicial review of the deportation order has been denied. United States v. Mendoza-
Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987).

tively reasonable” detention period of six months for removable aliens).
     469 538 U.S. 510 (2003). The goal of detention in Zadvydas had been found to be

“no longer practically attainable,” and detention therefore “no longer [bore] a reason-
able relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed.” 538 U.S. at
527.
