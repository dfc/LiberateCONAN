unless the prosecution in the second trial had to prove failing to
reduce speed to establish this particular offense.159 In 1990, the Court
modified the Brown approach, stating that the appropriate focus is
on same conduct rather than same evidence.160 That interpretation
held sway only three years, however, before being repudiated as “wrong
in principle [and] unstable in application.” 161 The Brown Court had
noted some limitations applicable to its holding,162 and more have
emerged subsequently. Principles appropriate in the “classically simple”
lesser-included-offense and related situations are not readily trans-
posable to “multilayered conduct” governed by the law of con-
spiracy and continuing criminal enterprise, and it remains the law
that “a substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime
are not the ‘same offense’ for double jeopardy purposes.” 163 For double
jeopardy purposes, a defendant is “punished . . . only for the of-
fense of which [he] is convicted”; a later prosecution or later punish-
ment is not barred simply because the underlying criminal activity
has been considered at sentencing for a different offense.164 Simi-
larly, recidivism-based sentence enhancement does not constitute mul-

    160  Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990) (holding that the state could not pros-
ecute a traffic offender for negligent homicide because it would attempt to prove con-
duct for which the defendant had already been prosecuted—driving while intoxi-
cated and failure to keep to the right of the median). A subsequent prosecution is
barred, the Court explained, if the government, to establish an essential element of
an offense, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant
has already been prosecuted. Id. at 521.
     161 United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 709 (1993) (applying Blockburger test

to determine whether prosecution for a crime, following conviction for criminal con-
tempt for violation of a court order prohibiting that crime, constitutes double jeop-
ardy).
     162 The Court suggested that if the legislature had provided that joyriding is a

separate offense for each day the vehicle is operated without the owner’s consent, so
that the two indictments each specifying a different date on which the offense oc-
curred would have required different proof, the result might have been different,
but this, of course, met the Blockburger problem. Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 169
n.8 (1977). The Court also suggested that an exception might be permitted where
the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the
facts necessary to sustain that charge had not occurred or had not been discovered.
Id. at 169 n.7. See also Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 150–54 (1977) (plural-
ity opinion) (exception where defendant elects separate trials); Ohio v. Johnson, 467
U.S. 493 (1984) (trial court’s acceptance of guilty plea to lesser included offense and
dismissal of remaining charges over prosecution’s objections does not bar subse-
quent prosecution on those “remaining” counts).
     163 United States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 389 (1992). The fact that Felix consti-

tuted a “large exception” to Grady was one of the reasons the Court cited in overrul-
ing Grady. United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 709–10 (1993).
     164 Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389 (1995) (consideration of defendant’s al-

leged cocaine dealings in determining sentence for marijuana offenses does not bar
subsequent prosecution on cocaine charges).
