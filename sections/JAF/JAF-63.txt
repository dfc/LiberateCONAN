of police interrogation was no unheralded novelty in Miranda v. Ari-
zona.317 Though the historical basis of the rule excluding coerced
and involuntary confessions, in both early state confession cases 318
and earlier cases from the lower federal courts,319 was their untrust-
worthiness,320 in Lisenba v. California,321 Justice Roberts drew a
distinction between the common law confession rule and the stan-
dard of due process. “[T]he fact that the confessions have been con-
clusively adjudged by the decision below to be admissible under State
law, notwithstanding the circumstances under which they were made,
does not answer the question whether due process was lacking. The
aim of the rule that a confession is inadmissible unless it was vol-
untarily made is to exclude false evidence. Tests are invoked to de-
termine whether the inducement to speak was such that there is a
fair risk the confession is false. . . . The aim of the requirement of
due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to
prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence, whether true
or false.” Over the next several years, while the Justices continued
to use the terminology of voluntariness, the Court accepted at dif-
ferent times the different rationales of trustworthiness and consti-
tutional fairness.322
    Ultimately, however, those Justices who chose to ground the ex-
clusionary rule on the latter consideration predominated, so that,
in Rogers v. Richmond,323 Justice Frankfurter spoke for six other
Justices in writing: “Our decisions under that [Fourteenth] Amend-
ment have made clear that convictions following the admission into

     322 Compare Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143 (1944), with Lyons v. Okla-

homa, 322 U.S. 596 (1944), and Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401 (1945). In Watts
v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49 (1949), Harris v. South Carolina, 338 U.S. 68 (1949), and
Turner v. Pennsylvania, 338 U.S. 62 (1949), five Justices followed the due process-
fairness standard while four adhered to a trustworthiness rationale. See 338 U.S. at
57 (Justice Jackson concurring and dissenting). In Stein v. New York, 346 U.S. 156,
192 (1953), the trustworthiness rationale had secured the adherence of six Justices.
The primary difference between the two standards is the admissibility under the
trustworthiness standard of a coerced confession if its trustworthiness can be estab-
lished, if, that is, it can be corroborated.

New York, 360 U.S. 315 (1959), and Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199 (1960). See
also Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 583 n.25 (1961), in which Justice Frank-
furter, announcing the judgment of the Court, observed that “the conceptions under-
lying the rule excluding coerced confessions and the privilege again self-
incrimination have become, to some extent, assimilated.”
