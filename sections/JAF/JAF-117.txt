ceeded its ceiling price and that the pepper had a “retention value”
in excess of that price.628 By a five-to-four decision, the Court ruled
that the government was not obliged to pay the present market value
of a tug when the value had been greatly enhanced as a conse-
quence of the government’s wartime needs.629
    Illustrative of the difficulties in applying the fair market stan-
dard of just compensation are two cases decided by five-to-four votes,
one in which compensation was awarded and one in which it was
denied. Held entitled to compensation for the value of improve-
ments on leased property for the life of the improvements and not
simply for the remainder of the term of the lease was a company
that, while its lease had no renewal option, had occupied the land
for nearly 50 years and had every expectancy of continued occu-
pancy under a new lease. Just compensation, the Court said, re-
quired taking into account the possibility that the lease would be
renewed, inasmuch as a willing buyer and a willing seller would
certainly have placed a value on the possibility.630 However, when
the Federal Government condemned privately owned grazing land
of a rancher who had leased adjacent federally owned grazing land,
it was held that the compensation owed need not include the value
attributable to the proximity to the federal land. The result would
have been different if the adjacent grazing land had been privately
owned, but the general rule is that government need not pay for
value that it itself creates.631
    Interest.—Ordinarily, property is taken under a condemnation
suit upon the payment of the money award by the condemner, and
no interest accrues.632 If, however, the property is taken in fact be-
fore payment is made, just compensation includes an increment which,
to avoid use of the term “interest,” the Court has called “an amount
sufficient to produce the full equivalent of that value paid contem-

(1973). The dissent argued that since upon expiration of the lease only salvage value
of the improvements could be claimed by the lessee, just compensation should be
limited to that salvage value. Id. at 480.
     631 United States v. Fuller, 409 U.S. 488 (1973). The dissent argued that the

principle denying compensation for governmentally created value should apply only
when the government was in fact acting in the use of its own property; here the
government was acting only as a condemnor. Id. at 494.
