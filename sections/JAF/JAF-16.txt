second trial, even if the termination was erroneous, is barred.72 The
reasons the Court has given for fixing the attachment of jeopardy
at a point prior to judgment and thus making some terminations of
trials before judgment final insofar as the defendant is concerned
is that a defendant has a “valued right to have his trial completed
by a particular tribunal.” 73 The reason that the defendant’s right
is so “valued” is that he has a legitimate interest in completing the
trial “once and for all” and “conclud[ing] his confrontation with so-
ciety,” 74 so as to be spared the expense and ordeal of repeated tri-
als, the anxiety and insecurity of having to live with the possibility
of conviction, and the possibility that the prosecution may strengthen
its case with each try as it learns more of the evidence and of the
nature of the defense.75 These reasons both inform the determina-
tion when jeopardy attaches and the evaluation of the permissibil-
ity of retrial depending upon the reason for a trial’s premature ter-
mination.
     A second trial may be permitted where a mistrial is the result
of “manifest necessity,” 76 as when, for example, the jury cannot reach
a verdict 77 or circumstances plainly prevent the continuation of the
trial.78 The question of whether there is double jeopardy becomes
more difficult, however, when the doctrine of “manifest necessity”
is called upon to justify a second trial following a mistrial granted
by the trial judge because of some event within the prosecutor’s con-
     72 Cf. United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470 (1971); Downum v. United States, 372

U.S. 734 (1963). “Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may
be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused,
prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrong-
doing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be con-
victed. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is
aborted before it is completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is
entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.” Ari-
