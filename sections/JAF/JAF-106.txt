cess of law, because it operated not upon production, but upon the
marketing of the product after the act was passed.556
    In the exercise of its comprehensive powers over revenue, fi-
nance, and currency, Congress may make Treasury notes legal ten-
der in payment of debts previously contracted 557 and may invali-
date provisions in private contracts calling for payment in gold coin,558
but rights against the United States arising out of contract are more
strongly protected by the Due Process Clause. Hence, a law purport-
ing to abrogate a clause in government bonds calling for payment
in gold coin was invalid,559 and a statute abrogating contracts of
war risk insurance was held unconstitutional as applied to outstand-
ing policies.560
    The Due Process Clause has been successfully invoked to de-
feat retroactive invasion or destruction of property rights in a few
cases. A revocation by the Secretary of the Interior of previous ap-
proval of plats and papers showing that a railroad was entitled to
land under a grant was held void as an attempt to deprive the com-
pany of its property without due process of law.561 The exception of
the period of federal control from the time limit set by law upon
claims against carriers for damages caused by misrouting of goods,
was read as prospective only because the limitation was an inte-
gral part of the liability, not merely a matter of remedy, and would
violate the Fifth Amendment if retroactive.562

enact uniform bankruptcy legislation, Congress has regularly autho-

     556 Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38 (1939). An increase in the penalty for produc-

tion of wheat in excess of quota was valid as applied retroactively to wheat already
planted, where Congress concurrently authorized a substantial increase in the amount
of the loan that might be made to cooperating farmers upon stored “farm marketing
excess wheat.” Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 133 (1942).

v. United States, 344 U.S. 386 (1953). Notice that these kinds of cases are precisely
the ones that would be condemned under the Contract Clause, even under the re-
laxed scrutiny now employed, if the action were taken by a state. E.g., United States
Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1 (1977). “Less searching standards” are imposed
by the Due Process Clauses than by the Contract Clause. Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. v. R.A. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 733 (1984). Also, statutory reservation of
the right to amend an agreement can defuse most such constitutional issues. Bowen
v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U.S. 41 (1986) (amend-
ment of Social Security Act to prevent termination by state when termination notice
already filed). The Court has addressed similar issues under breach of contract theory.
