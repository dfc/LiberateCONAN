     Congressional Regulation of Public Utilities.—Inasmuch as
Congress, in giving federal agencies jurisdiction over various public
utilities, usually has prescribed standards substantially identical with
those by which the Supreme Court has tested the validity of state
action, the review of agency orders seldom has turned on constitu-
tional issues. In two cases, however, maximum rates prescribed by
the Secretary of Agriculture for stockyard companies were sus-
tained only after detailed consideration of numerous items ex-
cluded from the rate base or from operating expenses, apparently
on the assumption that error with respect to any such item would
render the rates confiscatory and void.504 A few years later, in FPC
v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,505 the Court adopted an entirely different
approach. It held that the validity of the Commission’s order de-
pended upon whether the impact or total effect of the order is just
and reasonable, rather than upon the method of computing the rate
base. Rates that enable a company to operate successfully, to main-
tain its financial integrity, to attract capital, and to compensate its
investors for the risks assumed cannot be condemned as unjust and
unreasonable even though they might produce only a meager re-
turn in a rate base computed by the “present fair value” method.
    Orders prescribing the form and contents of accounts kept by
public utility companies,506 and statutes requiring a private carrier
to furnish the Interstate Commerce Commission with information
for valuing its property,507 have been sustained against the objec-
tion that they were arbitrary and invalid. An order of the Secre-
tary of Commerce directed to a single common carrier by water re-

to the effect that the Commission was not bound to use any single formula or com-
bination of formulas in determining rates.
