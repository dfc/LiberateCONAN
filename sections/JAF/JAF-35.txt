Several Justices would have gone further and required a compul-
sory joinder of all charges against a defendant growing out of a single
criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction, except where a crime
is not discovered until prosecution arising from the same transac-
tion has begun or where the same jurisdiction does not have cogni-
zance of all the crimes.170 But the Court has “steadfastly refused to
adopt the ‘single transaction’ view of the Double Jeopardy Clause.” 171
     Yeager v. United States,172 unlike Ashe, “entail[ed] a trial that
included multiple counts rather than a trial for a single offense. And,
while Ashe involved an acquittal for that single offense, this case
[Yeager] involves an acquittal on some counts and a mistrial de-
clared on others. The reasoning in Ashe is nevertheless controlling
because, for double jeopardy purposes, the jury’s inability to reach
a verdict on [some] counts was a nonevent and the acquittals on
the [other] counts are entitled to the same effect as Ashe’s acquit-
tal.” The lower court in Yeager had “reasoned that the hung counts
must be considered to determine what issues the jury decided in
the first trial. Viewed in isolation, the [lower] court explained, the
acquittals . . . would preclude retrial because [of the facts that the
jury would have had to have found in light of its acquittals]. Viewed
alongside the hung counts, however, the acquittals appeared less
decisive,” 173 because, if the jury had actually found the facts im-
plied by its acquittals, then it would have acquitted on the hung
counts as well. In other words, its having acquitted on some counts
and not on others was logically inconsistent.174 The Supreme Court,
however, found that nothing should be inferred from the failure to
acquit on some counts, because “there is no way to decipher what a
hung count represents. . . . A host of reasons—sharp disagree-
ment, confusion about the issues, exhaustion after a long trial, to
name but a few—could work alone or in tandem to cause a jury to

     170 Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 448 (1970) (Justices Brennan, Douglas, and

Marshall concurring). Justices Brennan and Marshall adhered to their position in
Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 170 (1977) (concurring); and Thompson v. Oklahoma,
429 U.S. 1053 (1977) (dissenting from denial of certiorari).
     171 Garrett v. United States, 471 U.S. 773, 790 (1985). Earlier, the approach had

been rejected by Chief Justice Burger in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 468 (1970)
(dissenting), by him and Justice Blackmun in Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 57
(1971) (dissenting), and, perhaps, by Justice Rehnquist in Turner v. Arkansas, 407
U.S. 366, 368 (1972) (dissenting).

     174 The Court drew an analogy between its finding that this logical inconsis-

tency does not affect the preclusive force of the acquittals under the Double Jeop-
ardy Clause, and Justice Holmes’ holding, in Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390,
393 (1932), “that a logical inconsistency between a guilty verdict and a verdict of
acquittal does not impugn the validity of either verdict.” 557 U.S. ___, No. 08–67,
slip op. at 1.
