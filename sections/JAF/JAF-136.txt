to 2005 expressing distaste for categorical regulatory takings analy-
sis. These decisions endorse Penn Central as the dominant mode of
analysis for inverse condemnation claims, confining the Court’s per
se rules to the “relatively narrow” physical occupation and total wipe-
out circumstances, and the “special context” of exactions.742
    Following the Penn Central decision, the Court grappled with
the issue of the appropriate remedy property owners should pursue
in objecting to land use regulations.743 The remedy question arises
because there are two possible constitutional objections to be made
to regulations that go “too far” in reducing the value of property or
which do not substantially advance a legitimate governmental in-
terest. The regulation may be invalidated as a denial of due pro-
cess, or may be deemed a taking requiring compensation, at least
for the period in which the regulation was in effect. The Court fi-
nally resolved the issue in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church
v. County of Los Angeles, holding that when land use regulation is
held to be a taking, compensation is due for the period of implemen-
tation prior to the holding.744 The Court recognized that, even though
government may elect in such circumstances to discontinue regula-
tion and thereby avoid compensation for a permanent property de-
privation, “no subsequent action by the government can relieve it
of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which
the taking was effective.” 745 Outside the land-use context, however,
the Court has now recognized a limited number of situations where
invalidation, rather than compensation, remains the appropriate tak-
ings remedy.746

sions are Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001), and Tahoe-Sierra Preserva-
tion Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002).
     743 See, e.g., Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980) (issue not reached

because property owners challenging development density restrictions had not sub-
mitted a development plan); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl. Ass’n, 452
U.S. 264, 293–97 (1981), and Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U.S. 314, 333–36 (1981) (reject-
ing facial taking challenges to federal strip mining law).
     744 482 U.S. 304 (1987). The decision was 6–3, Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opin-

ion of the Court being joined by Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, Powell, and
Scalia, and Justice Stevens’ dissent being joined in part by Justices Blackmun and
O’Connor. The position the Court adopted had been advocated by Justice Brennan
in a dissenting opinion in San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. v. City of San Diego, 450 U.S.
621, 636 (1981) (dissenting from Court’s holding that state court decision was not
“final judgment” under 28 U.S.C. § 1257).

requirement that small fractional interests in allotted Indian lands escheat to tribe,
rather than pass on to heirs); Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987) (pre-amendment
