Originally the Court required that the equivalent be in money, not
in kind,622 but more recently has cast some doubt on this asser-
tion.623 Just compensation is measured “by reference to the uses
for which the property is suitable, having regard to the existing busi-
ness and wants of the community, or such as may be reasonably
expected in the immediate future, . . . [but] ‘mere possible or imagi-
nary uses or the speculative schemes of its proprietor, are to be ex-
cluded.’ ” 624 The general standard thus is the market value of the
property, i.e., what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller.625 If
fair market value does not exist or cannot be calculated, resort must
be had to other data which will yield a fair compensation.626 How-
ever, the Court is resistant to alternative standards, having repudi-
ated reliance on the cost of substitute facilities.627 Just compensa-
tion is especially difficult to compute in wartime, when enormous
disruptions in supply and governmentally imposed price ceilings to-
tally skew market conditions. Holding that the reasons which un-
derlie the rule of market value when a free market exists apply as
well where value is measured by a government-fixed ceiling price,
the Court permitted owners of cured pork and black pepper to re-
cover only the ceiling price for the commodities, despite findings by
the Court of Claims that the replacement cost of the meat ex-

The value of the property to the government for its particular use is not a criterion.
United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., 229 U.S. 53 (1913); United States v. Twin
City Power Co., 350 U.S. 222 (1956). Attorneys’ fees and expenses are not embraced
in the concept. Dohany v. Rogers, 281 U.S. 362 (1930).
     Applying the owner’s-loss standard, the Court addressed a state program requir-
ing lawyers to deposit client funds that cannot earn net interest in a pooled account
generating interest for indigent legal aid. Brown, 538 U.S. at 237. Assuming a tak-
ing of the client’s interest, his pecuniary loss is nonetheless zero; hence, the just
compensation required is likewise. Brown is in tension with the Court’s earlier treat-
ment of a similar state program, where it recognized value in the possession, con-
trol, and disposition of the interest. Phillips v. Washington Legal Found., 524 U.S.
156, 170 (1998).

tion of city-owned landfill). In both cases the Court determined that market value
was ascertainable.
