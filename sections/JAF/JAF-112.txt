the Court’s willingness to defer to the highest court of the state in
resolving such an issue.599 As early as 1908, the Court was obli-
gated to admit that, notwithstanding its retention of the power of
judicial review, “[n]o case is recalled where this court has con-
demned as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment a taking up-
held by the state court as a taking for public uses . . . .” 600 How-
ever, in a 1946 case involving federal eminent domain power, the
Court cast considerable doubt upon the power of courts to review
the issue of public use. “We think that it is the function of Con-
gress to decide what type of taking is for a public use and that the
agency authorized to do the taking may do so to the full extent of
its statutory authority.” 601 There is some suggestion that “the scope
of the judicial power to determine what is a ‘public use’ ” may be
different as between Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment cases, with
greater power in the latter type of cases than in the former,602 but
it may well be that the case simply stands for the necessity for great
judicial restraint.603 Once it is admitted or determined that the tak-
ing is for a public use and is within the granted authority, the ne-
cessity or expediency of the particular taking is exclusively in the
legislature or the body to which the legislature has delegated the
decision, and is not subject to judicial review.604
    At an earlier time, the factor of judicial review would have been
vastly more important than it is now, inasmuch as the prevailing
judicial view was that the term “public use” was synonymous with
“use by the public” and that if there was no duty upon the taker to
permit the public as of right to use or enjoy the property taken,
the taking was invalid. But this view was rejected some time ago.605

U.S. 439, 446 (1930). See also Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984)

ture).
     600 Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry., 208 U.S. 598, 607 (1908). An act of con-

demnation was voided as not for a public use in Missouri Pac. Ry. v. Nebraska, 164
U.S. 403 (1896), but the Court read the state court opinion as acknowledging this
fact, thus not bringing it within the literal content of this statement.
     601 United States ex rel. TVA v. Welch, 327 U.S. 546, 551–52 (1946). Justices

Reed and Frankfurter and Chief Justice Stone disagreed with this view. Id. at 555,
557 (concurring).
     602 327 U.S. at 552.
     603 So it seems to have been considered in Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 32

(1954).
     604 Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 U.S. 700, 709 (1923); Bragg v. Weaver,

251 U.S. 57, 58 (1919); Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 33 (1954). “When the legisla-
ture’s purpose is legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make clear
that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings . . . are not to be carried out in
federal courts.” Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 242–43 (1984).
