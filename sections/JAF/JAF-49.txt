after Brown v. Walker were transactional immunity statutes,244 the
question of the constitutional sufficiency of use immunity did not
arise, although dicta in cases dealing with immunity continued to
assert the necessity of the former type of grant.245 But, beginning
in 1964, when it applied the Self-Incrimination Clause to the states,
the Court was faced with the problem that arose because a state
could grant immunity only in its own courts and not in the courts
of another state or of the United States.246 On the other hand, to
foreclose the states from compelling testimony because they could
not immunize a witness in a subsequent “foreign” prosecution would
severely limit state law enforcement efforts. Therefore, the Court
emphasized the “use” restriction rationale of Counselman and an-
nounced that as a “constitutional rule, a state witness could not be
compelled to incriminate himself under federal law unless federal
authorities were precluded from using either his testimony or evi-
dence derived from it,” and thus formulated a use restriction to that
effect.247 Then, while refusing to adopt the course because of statu-
tory interpretation reasons, the Court indicated that use restric-
tion in a federal regulatory scheme requiring the reporting of in-
criminating information was “in principle an attractive and apparently
practical resolution of the difficult problem before us,” citing Mur-
phy with apparent approval.248

400 U.S. 548, 571 (1971) (Justice Brennan dissenting). The exception was an immu-
nity provision of the bankruptcy laws, 30 Stat. 548 (1898), 11 U.S.C. § 25(a)(10),
repealed by 84 Stat. 931 (1970). The right of a bankrupt to insist on his privilege
against self-incrimination as against this statute was recognized in McCarthy v.
Arndstein, 266 U.S. 34, 42 (1924), “because the present statute fails to afford com-
plete immunity from a prosecution.” The statute also failed to prohibit the use of
derivative evidence. Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U.S. 71 (1920).
     245 E.g., Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 67 (1906); United States v. Monia, 317

U.S. 424, 425, 428 (1943); Smith v. United States, 337 U.S. 137, 141, 146 (1949);
United States v. Murdock, 284 U.S. 141, 149 (1931); Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S.
179, 182 (1954). In Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 436–37 (1956), Justice
Frankfurter described the holding of Counselman as relating to the absence of a
prohibition on the use of derivative evidence.
     246 Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), extended the clause to the states. That

Congress could immunize a federal witness from state prosecution and, of course,
extend use immunity to state courts, was held in Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S. 179
(1954), and had been recognized in Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591 (1896).
     247 Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U.S. 52, 77–99 (1964). Concurring, Jus-

tices White and Stewart argued at length in support of the constitutional sufficiency
of use immunity and the lack of a constitutional requirement of transactional immu-
nity. Id. at 92. See also Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273 (1968); Uniformed Sani-
tation Men Ass’n v. Commissioner of Sanitation, 392 U.S. 280 (1968); Garrity v. New
Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967), recognizing the propriety of compelling testimony with
a use restriction attached.
