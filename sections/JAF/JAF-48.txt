witness,235 the statute was soon rendered unenforceable by the rul-
ing in Counselman v. Hitchcock 236 that an analogous limited immu-
nity statute was unconstitutional because it did not confer an im-
munity coextensive with the privilege it replaced. Counselman was
ambiguous with regard to its grounds because it identified two faults
in the statute: it did not proscribe “derivative” evidence 237 and it
prohibited only future use of the compelled testimony.238 The latter
language accentuated a division between adherents of “transac-
tional” immunity and of “use” immunity which has continued to the
present.239 In any event, following Counselman, Congress enacted
a statute that conferred transactional immunity as the price for be-
ing able to compel testimony,240 and the Court sustained this law
in a five-to-four decision.241
    “The 1893 statute has become part of our constitutional fabric
and has been included ‘in substantially the same terms, in virtu-
ally all of the major regulatory enactments of the Federal Govern-
ment.’ ” 242 So spoke Justice Frankfurter in 1956, broadly reaffirm-
ing Brown v. Walker and upholding the constitutionality of a federal
immunity statute.243 Because all but one of the immunity acts passed

     239 “Transactional” immunity means that once a witness has been compelled to

testify about an offense, he may never be prosecuted for that offense, no matter how
much independent evidence might come to light; “use” immunity means that no tes-
timony compelled to be given and no evidence derived from or obtained because of
the compelled testimony may be used if the person is subsequently prosecuted on
independent evidence for the offense.

     241 Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591 (1896). The majority reasoned that one was

excused from testifying only if there could be legal detriment flowing from his act of
testifying. If a statute of limitations had run or if a pardon had been issued with
regard to a particular offense, a witness could not claim the privilege and refuse to
testify, no matter how much other detriment, such as loss of reputation, would at-
tach to his admissions. Therefore, because the statute acted as a pardon or amnesty
and relieved the witness of all legal detriment, he must testify. The four dissenters
contended essentially that the privilege protected against being compelled to incrimi-
nate oneself regardless of any subsequent prosecutorial effort, id. at 610, and that a
witness was protected against infamy and disparagement as much as prosecution.
Id. at 628.
     242 Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 438 (1956) (quoting Shapiro v. United

States, 335 U.S. 1, 6 (1948)).
     243 “[The] sole concern [of the privilege] is . . . with the danger to a witness forced

to give testimony leading to the infliction of ‘penalties affixed to the criminal acts’. . . .
Immunity displaces the danger. Once the reason for the privilege ceases, the privi-
lege ceases.” 350 U.S. at 438–39. The internal quotation is from Boyd v. United States,
116 U.S. 616, 634 (1886).
