by the Supreme Court. In Kohl v. United States 585 any doubts were
laid to rest, as the Court affirmed that the power was as necessary
to the existence of the National Government as it was to the exis-
tence of any state. The federal power of eminent domain is, of course,
limited by the grants of power in the Constitution, so that property
may only be taken for the effectuation of a granted power,586 but
once this is conceded the ambit of national powers is so wide-
ranging that vast numbers of objects may be effected.587 This pre-
rogative of the National Government can neither be enlarged nor
diminished by a state.588 Whenever lands in a state are needed for
a public purpose, Congress may authorize that they be taken, ei-
ther by proceedings in the courts of the state, with its consent, or
by proceedings in the courts of the United States, with or without
any consent or concurrent act of the state.589
    “Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,” the power
of eminent domain of state governments “was unrestrained by any
federal authority.” 590 The Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth
Amendment did not apply to the states,591 and at first the conten-
tion that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment af-
forded property owners the same measure of protection against the
states as the Fifth Amendment did against the Federal Govern-
ment was rejected.592 However, within a decade the Court rejected

tory authority for federal condemnation proceedings in federal courts was not en-
acted until 1888. Act of Aug. 1, 1888, ch. 728, 25 Stat. 357. See 1 NICHOLS ON EMINENT
DOMAIN § 1.24[5] (Julius L. Sackman, 2006).
    585 91 U.S. 367 (1876).
    586 United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry., 160 U.S. 668, 679 (1896).
    587 E.g., California v. Central Pacific Railroad, 127 U.S. 1, 39 (1888) (highways);

Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U.S. 525 (1894) (interstate bridges); Chero-
kee Nation v. Southern Kansas Ry, 135 U.S. 641 (1890) (railroads); Albert Hanson
Lumber Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 581 (1923) (canal); Ashwander v. TVA, 297
U.S. 288 (1936) (hydroelectric power). “Once the object is within the authority of
Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear.
For the power of eminent domain is merely the means to the end.” Berman v. Parker,
348 U.S. 26, 33 (1954).
    588 Kohl v. United States, 91 U.S. 367 374 (1876).
    589 Chappell v. United States, 160 U.S. 499, 510 (1896). The fact that land in-

cluded in a federal reservoir project is owned by a state, or that its taking may im-
pair the state’s tax revenue, or that the reservoir will obliterate part of the state’s
boundary and interfere with the state’s own project for water development and con-
servation, constitutes no barrier to the condemnation of the land by the United States.
Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U.S. 508 (1941). So too, land held in
trust and used by a city for public purposes may be condemned. United States v.
Carmack, 329 U.S. 230 (1946).
    590 Green v. Frazier, 253 U.S. 233, 238 (1920).
    591 Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833).
    592 Davidson v. City of New Orleans, 96 U.S. 97 (1878). The Court attached most

weight to the fact that both due process and just compensation were guaranteed in
the Fifth Amendment while only due process was contained in the Fourteenth, and
refused to equate the missing term with the present one.
