court, a commission, or an administrative body.656 Proceedings to
condemn land for the benefit of the United States are brought in
the federal district court for the district in which the land is lo-
cated.657 The estimate of just compensation is not required to be
made by a jury but may be made by a judge or entrusted to a com-
mission or other body.658 Federal courts may appoint a commission
in condemnation actions to resolve the compensation issue.659 If a
body other than a court is designated to determine just compensa-
tion, its decision must be subject to judicial review,660 although the
scope of review may be limited by the legislature.661 When the judg-
ment of a state court with regard to the amount of compensation is
questioned, the Court’s review is restricted. “All that is essential is
that in some appropriate way, before some properly constituted tri-
bunal, inquiry shall be made as to the amount of compensation, and
when this has been provided there is that due process of law which
is required by the Federal Constitution.” 662 “[T]here must be some-
thing more than an ordinary honest mistake of law in the proceed-
ings for compensation before a party can make out that the State
has deprived him of his property unconstitutionally.” 663 Unless, by
its rulings of law, the state court prevented a complainant from ob-
taining substantially any compensation, its findings as to the amount

that the United States has taken property without compensation) are governed by
the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), which vests the Court of Federal Claims (for-
merly the Claims Court) with jurisdiction over claims against the United States “founded
. . . upon the Constitution.” See Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 520 (1998).
Inverse condemnation claims against the United States not in excess of $10,000 may
also be heard in federal district court under the “Little Tucker Act.” 28 U.S.C.

      658 Bauman v. Ross, 167 U.S. 548 (1897). Even when a jury is provided to deter-

mine the amount of compensation, it is the rule at least in federal court that the
trial judge is to instruct the jury with regard to the criteria and this includes deter-
mination of “all issues” other than the precise issue of the amount of compensation,
so that the judge decides those matters relating to what is computed in making the
calculation. United States v. Reynolds, 397 U.S. 14 (1970).
