for admitting or excluding confessions and other admissions made
to police during custodial interrogation.286
    McNabb-Mallory Doctrine.—Perhaps one reason the Court did
not squarely confront the application of the Self-Incrimination Clause
to police interrogation and the admissibility of confessions in fed-
eral courts was that, in McNabb v. United States,287 it promul-
gated a rule excluding confessions obtained after an “unnecessary
delay” in presenting a suspect for arraignment after arrest.288 This
rule, developed pursuant to the Court’s supervisory power over the
lower federal courts 289 and hence not applicable to the states,290
was designed to implement the guarantees assured to a defendant
by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,291 and was clearly in-
formed with concern over incommunicado interrogation and co-
erced confessions.292 Although the Court never attempted to specify
a minimum time after which delay in presenting a suspect for ar-

was any historical connection . . . between the constitutional [self-incrimination] clause
and the [common law] confession-doctrine,” 3 J. WIGMORE, A TREATISE ON THE ANGLO-
AMERICAN SYSTEM OF EVIDENCE § 823, at 250 n.5 (3d ed. 1940); see also vol. 8 id. at
§ 2266 (McNaughton rev. 1961). It appears that while the two rules did develop sepa-
rately—the bar against self-incrimination deriving primarily from notions of liberty
and fairness, proscriptions against involuntary confessions deriving primarily from
notions of reliability—they did stem from some of the same considerations, and, in
fact, the confession rule may be considered in important respects to be an off-shoot
of the privilege against self-incrimination. See L. LEVY, ORIGINS OF THE FIFTH AMEND-
MENT: THE RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION 325–32, 495 n.43 (1968). See also Culombe
v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 581–84, especially 583 n.25 (1961) (Justice Frank-
furter announcing judgment of the Court).

     288 In Upshaw v. United States, 335 U.S. 410 (1948), the Court rejected lower

court interpretations that delay in arraignment was but one factor in determining
the voluntariness of a confession, and held that a confession obtained after a thirty-
hour delay was inadmissible per se. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449 (1957),
held that any confession obtained during an unnecessary delay in arraignment was
inadmissible. A confession obtained during a lawful delay before arraignment was
admissible. United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65 (1944).

cated that because the Court had no supervisory power over courts-martial, the rule
did not apply in military courts.

(1961) (Justice Frankfurter announcing judgment of the Court).
     291 Rule 5(a) requiring prompt arraignment was promulgated in 1946, but the

Court in McNabb relied on predecessor statutes, some of which required prompt ar-
raignment. Cf. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 451–54 (1957). Rule 5(b) re-
quires that the magistrate at arraignment must inform the suspect of the charge
against him, must warn him that what he says may be used against him, must tell
him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent, and must also provide for
the terms of bail.
