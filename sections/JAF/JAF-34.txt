tiple punishment for the “same” prior offense, but instead is a stiff-
ened penalty for the later crime.165
    The “Same Transaction” Problem.—The same conduct may
also give rise to multiple offenses in a way that would satisfy the
Blockburger test if that conduct victimizes two or more individuals,
and therefore constitutes a separate offense as to each of them. In
Hoag v. New Jersey,166 before the Double Jeopardy Clause was ap-
plied to the states, the Court found no due process problem in suc-
cessive trials arising out of a tavern hold-up in which five custom-
ers were robbed. Ashe v. Swenson,167 however, presented the Court
with the Hoag fact situation directly under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. The defendant had been acquitted at trial of robbing one
player in a poker game; the defense offered no testimony and did
not contest evidence that a robbery had taken place and that each
of the players had lost money. A second trial was held on a charge
that the defendant had robbed a second of the seven poker players,
and on the basis of stronger identification testimony the defendant
was convicted. Reversing the conviction, the Court held that the doc-
trine of collateral estoppel 168 was a constitutional rule made appli-
cable to the states through the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because
the only basis upon which the jury could have acquitted the defen-
dant at his first trial was a finding that he was not present at the
robbery, hence was not one of the robbers, the state could not relitigate
that issue; with that issue settled, there could be no conviction.169

     168 “ ‘Collateral estoppel’ is an awkward phrase . . . [which] means simply that

when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a final judgment, that
issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.” Id.
at 443. First developed in civil litigation, the doctrine was applied in a criminal case
in United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U.S. 85 (1916). See also Sealfon v. United
States, 332 U.S. 575 (1948). The term “collateral estoppel” has been replaced by “is-
sue preclusion,” which also includes the doctrine formerly known as “direct estop-
pel.” Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. ___, No. 07–371, slip op. at 9, n.5 (2008), quoted in

     169 Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 466 (1970). See also Harris v. Washington,

404 U.S. 55 (1971); Turner v. Arkansas, 407 U.S. 366 (1972). Cf. Dowling v. United
States, 493 U.S. 342 (1990), in which the Court concluded that the defendant’s pres-
ence at an earlier crime for which he had been acquitted had not necessarily been
decided in his acquittal. Dowling is distinguishable from Ashe, however, because in
Dowling the evidence relating to the first conviction was not a necessary element of
the second offense. In Bobby v. Bies, 556 U.S. ___, No. 08–598 (2009), the Court
noted that “issue preclusion is a plea available to prevailing parties. The doctrine
bars relitigation of determinations necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior pro-
ceeding.” Slip op. at 2–3. “In addition, even where the core requirements of issue
preclusion are met, an exception to the general rule may apply when a ‘change in
[the] applicable legal context’ intervenes.” Slip op. at 8, quoting Restatement (Sec-
ond) of Judgments, § 28, Comment c.
