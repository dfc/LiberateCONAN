the legal significance of how he reacted, are subject to open review.
“No more restricted scope of review would suffice adequately to pro-
tect federal constitutional rights. For the mental state of involun-
tariness upon which the due process question turns can never be
affirmatively established other than circumstantially—that is, by in-
ference; and it cannot be competent to the trier of fact to preclude
our review simply be declining to draw inferences which the histori-
cal facts compel. Great weight, of course, is to be accorded to the
inferences which are drawn by the state courts. In a dubious case,
it is appropriate . . . that the state court’s determination should con-
trol. But where, on the uncontested external happenings, coercive
forces set in motion by state law enforcement officials are unmistak-
ably in action; where these forces, under all the prevailing states
of stress, are powerful enough to draw forth a confession; where, in
fact, the confession does come forth and is claimed by the defen-
dant to have been extorted from him; and where he has acted as a
man would act who is subjected to such an extracting process—
where this is all that appears in the record—a State judgment that
the confession was voluntary cannot stand.” 402 Miranda, of course,
does away with the judgments about the effect of lack of warnings,
and the third phase, the legal determination of the interaction of
the first two phases, is determined solely by two factual determina-
tions: whether the warnings were given and if so whether there was
a valid waiver. Presumably, supported determinations of these two
facts by trial courts would preclude independent review by the Su-
preme Court. Yet, the Court has been clear that it may and will
independently review the facts when the factfinding has such a sub-
stantial effect on constitutional rights.403
    In Withrow v. Williams,404 the Court held that the rule of Stone
v. Powell,405 precluding federal habeas corpus review of a state pris-
oner’s claim that his conviction rests on evidence obtained through
an unconstitutional search or seizure, does not extend to preclude
federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s claim that his conviction
rests on statements obtained in violation of the safeguards man-
dated by Miranda.
