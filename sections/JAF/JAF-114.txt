    The Supreme Court has also approved generally the wide-
spread use of the power of eminent domain by federal and state
governments in conjunction with private companies to facilitate ur-
ban renewal, destruction of slums, erection of low-cost housing in
place of deteriorated housing, and the promotion of aesthetic val-
ues as well as economic ones. In Berman v. Parker,610 a unanimous
Court observed: “The concept of the public welfare is broad and in-
clusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical,
aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legisla-
ture to determine that the community should be beautiful as well
as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well as care-
fully patrolled.” For “public use,” then, it may well be that “public
interest” or “public welfare” is the more correct phrase.611 Berman
was applied in Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff,612 upholding the
Hawaii Land Reform Act as a “rational” effort to “correct deficien-
cies in the market determined by the state legislature to be attrib-
utable to land oligopoly.” Direct transfer of land from lessors to les-
sees was permissible, the Court held, there being no requirement
“that government possess and use property at some point during a
taking.” 613 “The ‘public use’ requirement is . . . coterminous with
the scope of a sovereign’s police powers,” the Court concluded.614
    The expansive interpretation of public use in eminent domain
cases may have reached its outer limit in Kelo v. City of New Lon-
don.615 There, a five-justice majority upheld as a public use the private-
to-private transfer of land for purposes of economic development,
at least in the context of a well-considered, areawide redevelop-
(1968), 16 U.S.C. § 79(c) (taking land for creation of Redwood National Park); Pub.
L. 93–444, 88 Stat. 1304 (1974) (taking lands for addition to Piscataway Park, Mary-
land); Pub. L. 100–647, § 10002 (1988) (taking lands for addition to Manassas Na-
tional Battlefield Park).
     610 348 U.S. 26, 32–33 (1954) (citations omitted). Rejecting the argument that

the project was illegal because it involved the turning over of condemned property
to private associations for redevelopment, the Court said: “Once the object is within
the authority of Congress, the means by which it will be attained is also for Con-
gress to determine. Here one of the means chosen is the use of private enterprise
for redevelopment of the area. Appellants argue that this makes the project a tak-
ing from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman. But the means of
executing the project are for Congress and Congress alone to determine, once the
public purpose has been established. The public end may be as well or better served
through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of govern-
ment—or so the Congress might conclude.” Id. at 33–34 (citations omitted).
     611 Most recently, the Court equated public use with “public purpose.” Kelo v.

City of New London, 545 U.S. 469, 480 (2005).
     612 467 U.S. 229, 243 (1984).
     613 467 U.S. at 243.
     614 467 U.S. at 240. See also Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1014

(1984) (required data disclosure by pesticide registrants, primarily for benefit of later
registrants, has a “conceivable public character”).
