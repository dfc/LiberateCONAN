for the same conduct,58 and to permit a federal prosecution after a
conviction in an Indian tribal court for an offense stemming from
the same conduct.59 Of course, when in fact two different units of
the government are subject to the same sovereign, the Double Jeop-
ardy Clause does bar separate prosecutions by them for the same
offense.60
     The clause speaks of being put in “jeopardy of life or limb,” which
as derived from the common law, generally referred to the possibil-
ity of capital punishment upon conviction, but it is now settled that
the clause protects with regard “to every indictment or information
charging a party with a known and defined crime or misdemeanor,
whether at the common law or by statute.” 61 Despite the clause’s
literal language, it can apply as well to sanctions that are civil in
form if they clearly are applied in a manner that constitutes “pun-
ishment.” 62 Ordinarily, however, civil in rem forfeiture proceedings




     58 Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82 (1985) (defendant who crossed state line in

the course of a kidnap and murder was prosecuted for murder in both states).
     59 United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004) (federal prosecution for assaulting

a federal officer after tribal conviction for “violence to a policeman”). The Court con-
cluded that Congress has power to recognize tribal sovereignty to prosecute non-
member Indians, that Congress had done so, and that consequently the tribal pros-
ecution was an exercise of tribal sovereignty, not an exercise of delegated federal
power on which a finding of double jeopardy could be based.
     60 Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907) (trial by military court-martial

precluded subsequent trial in territorial court); Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387 (1970)
(trial by municipal court precluded trial for same offense by state court). It was as-
sumed in an early case that refusal to answer questions before one House of Con-
gress could be punished as a contempt by that body and by prosecution by the United
States under a misdemeanor statute, In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 672 (1897), but
there had been no dual proceedings in that case and it seems highly unlikely that
the case would now be followed. Cf. Colombo v. New York, 405 U.S. 9 (1972).
     61 Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163, 169 (1874). The clause generally has

no application in noncriminal proceedings. Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391 (1938).
     62 The clause applies in juvenile court proceedings that are formally civil. Breed

v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519 (1975). See also United States v. One Assortment of 89 Fire-
arms, 465 U.S. 354 (1984); United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989) (civil pen-
alty under the False Claims Act constitutes punishment if it is overwhelmingly dis-
proportionate to compensating the government for its loss, and if it can be explained
only as serving retributive or deterrent purposes); Montana Dep’t of Revenue v. Kurth
Ranch, 511 U.S. 767 (1994) (tax on possession of illegal drugs, “to be collected only
after any state or federal fines or forfeitures have been satisfied,” constitutes punish-
ment for purposes of double jeopardy). But see Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001)
(a statute that has been held to be civil and not criminal in nature cannot be deemed
punitive “as applied” to a single individual). The issue of whether a law is civil or
punitive in nature is essentially the same for ex post facto and for double jeopardy
analysis. 531 U.S. at 263.
