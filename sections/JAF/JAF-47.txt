alism” that parallels the cooperative federalism and cooperative pros-
ecution on which application against states is premised, and
consequently concern with foreign prosecution is beyond the scope
of the Self-Incrimination Clause.231
The Power To Compel Testimony and Disclosure
    Immunity.—“Immunity statutes, which have historical roots deep
in Anglo-American jurisprudence, are not incompatible [with the val-
ues of the Self-Incrimination Clause]. Rather they seek a rational
accommodation between the imperatives of the privilege and the le-
gitimate demands of government to compel citizens to testify. The
existence of these statutes reflects the importance of testimony, and
the fact that many offenses are of such a character that the only
persons capable of giving useful testimony are those implicated in
the crime.” 232 Apparently the first immunity statute was enacted
by Parliament in 1710 233 and it was widely copied in the colonies.
The first federal immunity statute was enacted in 1857, and immu-
nized any person who testified before a congressional committee from
prosecution for any matter “touching which” he had testified.234
    Revised in 1862 so as merely to prevent the use of the congres-
sional testimony at a subsequent prosecution of any congressional
357 U.S. 371 (1958) (state may compel a witness to give testimony that might in-
criminate him under federal law), and Feldman v. United States, 322 U.S. 487 (1944)
(testimony compelled by a state may be introduced into evidence in the federal courts)).
Murphy held that a state could compel testimony under a grant of immunity but
that, because the state could not extend the immunity to federal courts, the Su-
preme Court would not permit the introduction of evidence into federal courts that
had been compelled by a state or that had been discovered because of state com-
pelled testimony. The result was apparently a constitutionally compelled one arising
from the Fifth Amendment itself, 378 U.S. at 75–80, rather than one taken pursu-
ant to the Court’s supervisory power as Justice Harlan would have preferred. Id. at
80 (concurring). Congress has power to confer immunity in state courts as well as
in federal in order to elicit information, Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S. 179 (1954),
but whether Congress must do so or whether the immunity would be conferred sim-
ply through the act of compelling the testimony Murphy did not say.
     Whether testimony could be compelled by either the Federal Government or a
state that could incriminate a witness in a foreign jurisdiction is unsettled. See Zicarelli
v. New Jersey State Comm’n of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 480, 481 (1972) (reserv-
ing question), but an affirmative answer seems unlikely. Cf. Murphy, 378 U.S. at
58–63, 77.
     231 United States v. Balsys, 524 U.S. 666 (1998).
     232 Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 445–46 (1972). It has been held that

the Fifth Amendment itself precludes the use as criminal evidence of compelled ad-
missions, Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967), but this case and dicta in
others is unreconciled with the cases that find that one may “waive” though inadver-
tently the privilege and be required to testify and incriminate oneself. Rogers v. United
States, 340 U.S. 367 (1951).
     233 9 Anne, c. 14, 3–4 (1710). See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 445

n.13 (1972).
     234 Ch. 19, 11 Stat. 155 (1857). There was an exception for perjury committed

while testifying before Congress.
