the efficiency of the rack and thumbscrew can be matched, given
the proper subject, by more sophisticated modes of ‘persuasion.’ A
prolonged interrogation of the accused who is ignorant of his rights
and who has been cut off from the moral support of friends and
relatives is not infrequently an effective technique of terror.” 304
    Although the Court would not hold that prolonged questioning
by itself made a resultant confession involuntary,305 it did increas-
ingly find coercion present even in intermittent questioning over a
period of days of incommunicado detention.306 In Stein v. New York,307
however, the Court affirmed convictions of experienced criminals who
had confessed after twelve hours of intermittent questioning over a
period of thirty-two hours of incommunicado detention. Although the
questioning was less intensive than in the prior cases, Justice Jack-
son for the majority stressed that the correct approach was to bal-
ance “the circumstances of pressure against the power of resis-
tance of the person confessing. What would be overpowering to the
weak of will or mind might be utterly ineffective against an experi-
enced criminal.” 308 By the time of the decision in Haynes v. Wash-
ington,309 however, which held inadmissible a confession made by
an experienced criminal because of the “unfair and inherently coer-
cive context” in which the confession was made, it was clear that
the Court often focused more on the nature of the coercion without
regard to the individual characteristics of the suspect.310 Neverthe-

     306 Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49 (1949) (Suspect held incommunicado without

arraignment for seven days without being advised of his rights. He was held in soli-
tary confinement in a cell with no place to sleep but the floor and questioned each
day except Sunday by relays of police officers for periods ranging in duration from
three to nine-and-one-half hours); Turner v. Pennsylvania, 338 U.S. 62 (1949) (sus-
pect held on suspicion for five days without arraignment and without being advised
of his rights. He was questioned by relays of officers for periods briefer than in Watts
during both days and nights); Harris v. South Carolina, 338 U.S. 68 (1949) (Suspect
in murder case arrested in Tennessee on theft warrant, taken to South Carolina,
and held incommunicado. He was questioned for three days for periods as long as
12 hours, not advised of his rights, not told of the murder charge, and denied access
to friends and family while being told his mother might be arrested for theft). Jus-
tice Jackson dissented in the latter two cases, willing to hold that a confession ob-
tained under lengthy and intensive interrogation should be admitted short of a show-
ing of violence or threats of it and especially if the truthfulness of the confession
may be corroborated by independent means. 338 U.S. at 57.

could communicate with his family).
